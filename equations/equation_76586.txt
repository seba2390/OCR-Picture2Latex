It is tailored on the RothC carbon model dynamics and assumes as baseline the value of the SOC equilibrium under constant environmental conditions. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the response of the model to changes of temperature, Net Primary Production (NPP), and land use soil class (forest, grassland, arable). A non-standard monthly time-stepping procedure has been proposed to approximate the SOC change index in the Alta Murgia National Park, a protected area in the Italian Apulia region, selected as test site. In the case of arable class, the SOC change index exhibits a negative trend which can be inverted by a suitable organic fertilization program here proposed. \keywords{Soil Organic Carbon model \and sensitivity analysis \and non-standard discrete approximation} \PACS{PACS code1 \and PACS code2 \and more} \subclass{86A08 \and 65L05 \and 86-10 \and 86-08} \end{abstract} \section{Introduction} For reporting on Target 15.1, one of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) adopted by the United Nations \cite{minelli2017scientific} in 2015, the Good practice guidance \cite{good} indicates how to calculate the extent of land degradation. It recommends the development and the use of analytical methods for measuring the three indicators which address the key aspects of land-based natural capital: trends in land cover, trends in land productivity and trends in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. These indicators can assess the quantity and the quality of land-based natural capital and most of the associated ecosystem services. \noindent Roughly speaking, SOC stock is the carbon captured by plants through photosynthesis which remains in the soil after decomposition of soil organic matter. A decrease in SOC stocks is among the significant universal indicators for land and soil degradation and can compromise all the efforts to achieve the SDGs especially those with reference to food, health, water, climate, and land management \cite{lorenz2019soil}. \noindent Well-validated models which take into account the interactions among climate, soil and land use management can be used to predict SOC changes under the different management and climatic conditions. The Rothamsted carbon model (RothC, \cite{coleman1996rothc}, \cite{parshotam1996rothamsted}) is one of the most commonly used tool to simulate soil organic carbon dynamics in arable, grassland and forest systems. Although it does not place the action of bacteria at the hearth of the mechanisms of decomposition as required by current theories \cite{lehmann2015contentious,hammoudi2015mathematical}, it is widely used because it captures the general principles of soil organic dynamics, it is relatively simple and general, it requires relatively few parameters and can be easily applied at scales from regional \cite{farina2013modification}, to global \cite{morais2019detailed}. \noindent In this paper, for making a scenario analysis of SOC changes, we propose a novel model tailored on RothC dynamics, which describes the evolution of the so-called {\it SOC change index}. It is defined as the difference between the SOC values at the last and the first year (as in \cite{morais2018proposal}), here normalized by the carbon inputs generated by the total plant and the farmyard manure, both evaluated at the initial baseline year. As test example, we evaluate the impact of changes in temperature on the achievement of land degradation neutrality for the SOC indicator in the Alta Murgia National Park, a protected area in the Apulia region located in the south of Italy. It is known that the increase or decrease of the SOC stocks under climate change will depend upon which process, in the future and in a given location, dominates between increased plant inputs through increases in net primary production (NPP), and increased decomposition rates \cite{gottschalk2012will}. With the aim of detecting factors which determine the size and the direction of change in the considered protected area, a sensitivity analysis has been performed based on the direct method described in \cite{dickinson1976sensitivity}. a sensitivity analysis, based on the direct method described in \cite{dickinson1976sensitivity}, is performed. The sensitivity analysis has been is applied to a modified version of the {\it SOC change index model}, based on time averaged values, and has provided provides local information on the impact of parameters change on the behavior of the system solution. In particular, we have evaluated evaluate the impact on the SOC change index of the variation of three representative parameters: mean annual temperature, NPP annual values with respect to reference values and degree of decomposability of plant material (the so-called {\it DPM/RPM ratio}), which in turn is related to the class of land use (forest, grassland and arable). \noindent Trends in SOC changes from $2005$ taken as baseline year and $2019$ as final year, Trends in SOC changes from $2005$, taken as baseline year, to $2019$, the final year, have been are simulated by means of a monthly discrete non-standard approximation of the continuous model for forest, grassland and arable systems. It is based on the discrete non-standard monthly time stepping procedure provided in \cite{diele2021non} for solving the carbon dynamics in all of the compartments. Given the linearity of the RothC model, the SOC change can be discretized with the same matrix function of the monthly stepsize. Results obtained indicate positive trends for SOC change in case of both forest and grassland systems. When the arable class is considered without including the input of farm fertilizers, our model predicts a negative trend of the introduced normalized SOC change variable. As a final result, we evaluate the optimal organic fertilization program to invert the trend and keep positive the SOC change. When used with predicted climate and NPP data, the optimal fertilization program may guarantee the achievement of land degradation neutrality for the SOC indicator. \noindent The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:1} we briefly describe the original RothC model and define the SOC indicator for the continuous counterpart of the original model. Moreover we introduce a more realistic representation of the density function of the plant carbon input which can be proven to be periodic. Input data and parameters are then identified and described. In Section \ref{sec:3} we explain how the issue of determining the initial carbon input is solved in the proposed formulation and we define a novel SOC change index which overcome the problem. Then, in Section \ref{sec:4} we analyze the model assuming that there is no carbon input due to the organic fertilization and determine the sensitivity of the model to the variation of the above mentioned parameters: temperature, NPP and land use class. The issue of a possible positive contribution of organic fertilization is faced in Section \ref{sec:5} where we propose to consider the farmyard manure input as a control variable to reach neutrality, and modify the model accordingly. To perform the simulations, we apply a numerical non-standard technique which preserves the equilibrium state of the continuous dynamics and is described in Section \ref{sec:6}. In Section \ref{sec:7} we present a test case illustrating the trends of SOC change in a protected area, in the years 2005-2019, as a function of the measured changes of temperature and NPP for the three land use classes analyzed (forest, grassland, arable). Finally, in Section \ref{sec:8} we draw our conclusions. \section{The RothC model} Within the RothC model, soil organic carbon is divided into the five carbon pools noted: $c_{dpm}$, $c_{rpm}$, $c_{hum}$, $c_{bio}$ and $c_{iom}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:1}). \begin{figure} \begin{center} \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{flowchart.JPG} \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{flowchartROTHC.png} \caption{\small Flow chart of the RothC model.} \end{center} \end{figure} The already decomposed plant material is regarded as $c_{hum}$, whereas the total carbon mass of microbial organisms is represented by the $c_{bio}$ pool. All non decomposable or inert material is defined as $c_{iom}$. In general, all pools $c_{i}$ will decompose and form $CO_2$, $c_{bio}$ and $c_{hum}$. The four active compartments $c_{dpm}$, $c_{rpm}$, $c_{hum}$ and $c_{bio}$, undergo decomposition as a function of different rate constants which correspond to the entries of the vector $\mathbf{k}\,=\, [k_{dpm},k_{rpm},k_{bio},k_{hum}]^\intercal$, and of the rate modifier $\rho(t)$ which depends on the clay content of the soil, on climate variables (rainfall, temperature, open pan evaporation) and land cover. The fraction $\alpha\,+\beta$ of metabolised carbon incorporated into the sum of compartments $ c_{bio}(t)\, +\,c_{hum}(t)$ is determined by the clay content of the soil, while the remaining part $\delta:= 1-\alpha-\beta$ is released as $CO_2$ and lost by the system. \noindent For the aim of what follows we denote with $T >0$ the length of a reference time interval (generally one year) and we formulate the RothC model as: \begin{equation} \displaystyle \frac{d\mathbf{c}}{dt}\, = \, \rho(t)\, A\, \mathbf{c} \, +\, \mathbf{b}(t),\, \qquad t\in ]\,t_0\,+\,nT,\, t_0\,+\,(n+1)T\,]\,, \quad n=0,\,\,\dots,\end{equation}
