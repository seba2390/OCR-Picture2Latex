\begin{equation}J = \sum_{t=1}^T H(b_t^m) $ to minimize the uncertainty about the property of the object as soon as possible in the episode. \rebuttal{We only minimize the entropy of the property rather than the entropy of the full belief $b_t$, because this is what we want to gather information about in our problem.} Minimizing this cost, for a Gaussian belief $b_t^m$ with mean and variance $\mu_t^m, \sigma_t^m$, is equivalent to minimizing the cost \begin{equation} J = \sum_{t=1}^T \log \sigma_t^m.\end{equation}
