\section{Proofs for Section \ref{factor_model}}

In Section \ref{factor1}, by analysing the total variation distance between two high-dimensional Gaussians and applying the Davis-Kahan theorem, we show that factor model with linear regression as downstream tasks has $\kappa$-transferability (Lemma \ref{factor_ti}), where $\kappa$ depends on the largest and smallest singular value of the ground truth parameter $B^* $. In Section \ref{factor2} and Section \ref{factor3}, we prove two lemmas that will be used in the proof of Theorem \ref{factor_main}. To be specific, in Section \ref{factor2}, we upper bound the bracketing number of the set $\mP(\mathcal{B})$ by using $\epsilon$-discretization (Lemma \ref{factor_bn}). In Section \ref{factor3}, we prove Lemma \ref{factor_rc}, which will be used to upper bound the Rademacher complexity of the function class $\ell\circ\mathcal{G}_{B,\mathcal{C}}$. In Section \ref{factor4}, we prove Theorem \ref{factor_main}.
Finally, in Section \ref{fast_rate}, we provide a refined analysis for proving Theorem \ref{factor_fast_rate}.
