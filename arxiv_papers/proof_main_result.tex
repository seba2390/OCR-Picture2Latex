\section{Proofs for Section \ref{main_results}}

In Section \ref{main1}, we prove Theorem \ref{tv_mle}, which gives a TV distance guarantee for the MLE step in Algorithm \ref{mle+erm}. Our proof is inspired by \citet{van2000empirical,Zhang_2006}, and largely follows \citet{agarwal2020flambe,pmlr-v178-liu22f}. In Section \ref{main2}, we prove Theorem \ref{error_bound} that guarantees the performance of Algorithm \ref{mle+erm} by upper bounding the excess risk. The proof relies on the fact that the labeled data $\{x_j,y_j\}^n_{j=1}$ are independent of the unlabeled data $\{x_i,s_i\}^m_{i=1}$. In Section \ref{main3}, we prove Corollary \ref{rc_covering} based on the analysis of Gaussian complexity. In Section \ref{main4}, we prove Theorem \ref{weak_error_bound} by first showing that the MLE step in Algorithm \ref{mle+erm} actually guarantees an upper bound on the Hellinger distance, which is stronger than the TV distance guarantee mentioned in Theorem \ref{tv_mle}.
