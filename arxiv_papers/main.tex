\abstract{ This article reports the laser calibration of the hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment in the LHC Run~2 data campaign. The upgraded Laser~II calibration system is described. The system was commissioned during the first LHC Long Shutdown, exhibiting a stability better than 0.8\% for the laser light monitoring. The methods employed to derive the detector calibration factors with data from the laser calibration runs are also detailed. These allowed to correct for the response fluctuations of the 9852 photomultiplier tubes of the Tile Calorimeter with a total uncertainty of 0.5\% plus a luminosity-dependent sub-dominant term. Finally, we report the regular monitoring and performance studies using laser events in both standalone runs and during proton collisions. These studies include channel timing and quality inspection, and photomultiplier linearity and response dependence on anode current.}

The Laser~II calibration system of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter probes individually the 9852 PMTs of the detector, together with the readout electronics of each channel. It is one of the three dedicated systems ensuring the calibration of the full calorimeter response. The Laser~II system has undergone a substantial upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 1 that improved its stability for the calibration of the calorimeter in Run~2. The readout electronics was renewed and a new light splitter was installed; the system now includes ten photodiodes to monitor the light across its path in the Optics box.

Laser runs were used to regularly determine the PMT response and calculate the calibration constants $f_\mathrm{Las}$, which were updated weekly for the cell energy reconstruction. The PMT response fluctuations are highly correlated with the LHC operations, with the response decreasing with integrated current and recovering in following technical stops of the collider. The calibrations obtained with the laser and caesium source are consistent within 0.4\%, dominating the systematic uncertainty on the PMT calibration scale. In addition, a sub-dominant uncertainty on the PMT relative inter-calibration was found to have a luminosity dependence. The linearity of the PMTs was studied to ensure that the calibration factors are accurate across the dynamic range of the PMT response.% and 99.66\% of them were found to have a deviation from the linearity smaller than 1\%.

Laser events were also used to evaluate the timing of the readout electronics, monitor the stability of time calibration and detect pathological behaviours in the calorimeter channels in data quality activities, contributing to the high TileCal performance in Run 2.
% Moreover, it is shown that the PMT response determined with laser can be used to study the model of PMT degradation with integrated current, which constitutes an important ingredient to estimate the TileCal performance in future runs.
