Particle Gibbs algorithms are Gibbs-like MCMC samplers that target the posterior distribution of Feynman--Kac models~\citep{Andrieu2010particle,lindsten2012ancestor,lindsten2014particle}.
In their simplest form, they consist in running a particle filter algorithm conditioned on the current state of the MCMC chain ``surviving'' the resampling step. This kernel, called conditional SMC (cSMC), can be proven to be ergodic for the pathwise smoothing distribution of the systems under the weak hypothesis that the potential functions are bounded above~\citep[and references within]{lee2020coupled}. In Algorithm~\ref{alg:csmc}, we reproduce the original version~\citep{Andrieu2010particle} of a cSMC kernel with $N \geq 2$ particles, targeting the posterior distribution of a generic Feynman--Kac model $\pi(x_{0:T}) \propto g_0(x_0) \, p_0(x_0) \left\{\prod_{t=1}^T g_t(x_t, x_{t-1}) \, p_t(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) \right\}$. This will serve as the basis for our discussion in the remainder of Section~\ref{sec:pgibbs_samplers}.

\end{algorithm}

Other versions of this algorithm exist, in particular, when it is possible to evaluate $p_t$ pointwise, we can rejuvenate the selection of the genealogy, allowing for lower degeneracy in the early time steps. The most notable two such methods are the backward and ancestor sampling methods~\citep[respectively]{whiteley2010discussion,lindsten2014particle}. Another method, useful in our context, is that of \citet[Section 3]{corenflos2022sequentialized}, which implements a parallel-in-time conditional SMC, particularly amenable to when the dynamics model is separable, that is, when $p_t(x_t \mid x_{t-1}) = p_t(x_t)$ does not depend on $x_{t-1}$ as will be the case in the next section.
