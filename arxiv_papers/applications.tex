% \section{Applications}\label{applications}

% In this section, we consider three applications to instantiate our general theoretical framework. In each application, we first specify the latent variable models, the downstream tasks and the assumptions. Then, we verify the translation invariance property. Finally, we give theoretical guarantees of the prediction error by Theorem \ref{error_bound}. 

% and upper bound the entropy and the Rademacher complexity of the function classes
