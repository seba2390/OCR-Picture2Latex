\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{con_fut}

In this work, we successfully offloaded the time-consuming deep and shallow convection calculations in the atmosphere model of CESM to Xeon Phi. We performed a number of optimizations including load balancing column computations corresponding to varying cloud cover, reduction of firstprivate variables to reduce data copying overheads, avoiding false sharing, proportional partitioning across CPU and co-processor cores, and strength reduction techniques. Our combined set of optimizations yielded 30\% performance improvements with Xeon Phi. In future, we plan to adopt similar strategies for other components of CESM and provide large-scale improvements for the entire CESM on Intel Xeon Phi architectures.
We also plan to explore our optimizations in the future Intel Xeon Phi architecture of Knights Landing.
