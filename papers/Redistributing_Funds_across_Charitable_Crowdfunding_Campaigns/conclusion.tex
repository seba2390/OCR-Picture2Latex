\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we explore the possibility of redistribution of crowdfunding donations. We build the case for redistribution and develop a classification of redistribution models. We implement these models as a set of constraints within a campaign-success optimization problem and evaluate their potential efficiency using data from \lag, an online crowdfunding platform. We find that a range of redistribution schemes can provide different levels of benefits in terms of campaign success rates. We also find redistribution schemes in the wild and explore how they are able to succeed despite disregarding donor preferences. Finally, we considered different ways that redistribution mechanisms could be implemented and integrated within a crowdfunding platform and highlight some of the issues that crowdfunding designers should consider.
