\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


 
We have presented three sparsity-adaptive channel vector denoising algorithms for 1-bit mmWave massive MIMO systems.
%
Two of our algorithms denoise 1-bit measurements of the channel estimates using BEACHES~\cite{ghods19a} in order to automatically adapt the denoising parameter to the instantaneous channel realization. 
%
While 1-BEACHES applies  BEACHES to the 1-bit measurements using the effective noise variance (which also includes the quantization noise variance), $\alpha$-BEACHES uses a Bussgang-like scaling factor~\cite{bussgang52a}, which results in superior performance.
%
We have also introduced SAND (short for Sparsity-Adaptive oNe-bit Denoiser), a novel denoising algorithm with $\setO(B\log(B))$ complexity, which jointly optimizes the thresholding parameter and the scaling factor in a nonparametric fashion. 
%
Our simulations have shown that $\alpha$-BEACHES and SAND perform equally well under the considered LoS and non-LoS mmWave channels and outperform $1$-BEACHES as well as other considered baseline methods in the case of 16-QAM transmission.
