% % \textbf{Learning with noisy data}
% There is a long line of work relating early stopped GD with a corresponding regularized solution~\citep{friedman2003gradient, yao2007early, suggala2018connecting, ali2018continuous,neu2018iterate,ali2020implicit}. Closest to our work is~\citet{ali2018continuous} and~\citet{suggala2018connecting} where for regression tasks authors theoretically relate properties of an early stopped GD solution with a regularized solution, obtained with a data-independent regularization coefficient.
