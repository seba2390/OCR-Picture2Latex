We summarize the ongoing scientific program of the 12 GeV Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and give an outlook into future opportunities.  The program addresses important topics in nuclear, hadronic, and electroweak physics, including  nuclear femtography, meson and baryon spectroscopy, quarks and gluons in nuclei, precision tests of the standard model and dark sector searches.  Potential upgrades of CEBAF and their impact on scientific reach are discussed, such as higher luminosity, the addition of polarized and unpolarized positron beams, and doubling the beam energy.
