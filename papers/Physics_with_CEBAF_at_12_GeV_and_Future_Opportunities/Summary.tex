\section{Summary}
The 12 GeV era of CEBAF is well underway and, as discussed in section 1.1, many important experimental results are being reported. A diverse and exciting program of approved experiments is planned for the next 8-10 years. In addition, there is great potential to upgrade CEBAF to realize higher luminosities and energies as well as the production of polarized and unpolarized positron beams. With the realization of these upgrades there is a rich and unique program of experimental nuclear and particle physics that will extend the life of the facility well into the 2030â€™s and beyond. CEBAF will thus provide the capability to address the high luminosity frontier of hadronic nuclear physics, complementary to the Electron Ion Collider and other international facilities.
