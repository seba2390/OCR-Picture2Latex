\section{Conclusion }
\noindent In this paper, we have shed light on the main distributed computing landscape in cloud-edge-fog-mist continuum. In particular, we have first presented a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of In-Network Computing paradigm, including a taxonomy, technology enablers and implementation techniques. We have laid out a comprehensive summary of existing research on Computing, Caching and Communication (3C) integration and highlighted the role of In-Network Computing in shaping next-generation networks infrastructures (NGNI). 	
Based on these, we have scrutinized the necessity of enabling In-Network Computing with 3C integration to fulfill the stringent requirements of emerging applications. Specifically, through an extensive analysis of several use-cases, we have examined the synergy between INC and 3C integration to highlight the crucial role of INC in NGNI. Then, we have articulated the challenges of leveraging In-Network Computing in NGNI from different perspectives, including hardware implementation, architectural design, regulatory and business aspects.
Provided the insights concluded from this thorough tutorial, we conclude with several opportunities and future research directions to achieve the stringent requirements of futuristic applications and successful deployment of NGNI.
