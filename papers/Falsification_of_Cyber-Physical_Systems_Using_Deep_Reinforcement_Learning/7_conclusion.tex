\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we report an approach which adopts reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problem of robustness-guided falsification of CPS systems. We implement our approach in a prototype tool and conduct preliminary evaluations with a widely adopted CPS system. The evaluation results show that our method can reduce the number of episodes to find the falsifying input. As a future work, we plan to extend the current work to explore more reinforcement learning algorithms and evaluate our methods on more CPS benchmarks.
