\section{Main Procedures of ICL}
The main procedures of ICL are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:icl_process}. Pretraining is significant for developing the ICL ability of LLMs, and the optional warmup stage can further improve it. For the demonstrations, the most important procedure is demonstration design. With a pretrained LLM and a well-designed demonstration, a proper scoring strategy finally yield the task output.
