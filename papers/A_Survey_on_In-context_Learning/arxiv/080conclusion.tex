In this paper, we survey the existing ICL literature and provide an extensive review of advanced ICL techniques, including training strategies, demonstration designing strategies, evaluation datasets and resources, as well as related analytical studies. Furthermore, we highlight critical challenges and potential directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey about ICL. We hope this survey can highlight the current research status of ICL and shed light on future work on this promising paradigm.
