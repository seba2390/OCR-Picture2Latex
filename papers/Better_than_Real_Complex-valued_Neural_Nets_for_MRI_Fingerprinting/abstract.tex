The task of MRI fingerprinting is to identify tissue parameters from
complex-valued MRI signals.  The prevalent approach is
dictionary based, where a test MRI signal is compared to stored MRI
signals with known tissue parameters and the most similar
signals and tissue parameters retrieved.  Such an approach does
not scale with the number of parameters and is rather slow when the
tissue parameter space is large.  

Our first novel contribution is to use deep learning as an efficient
nonlinear inverse mapping approach.  We
generate synthetic (tissue, MRI) data from an MRI simulator, and use
them to train a deep net to map the MRI signal to the tissue
parameters directly.

Our second novel contribution is to develop a complex-valued neural network
with new cardioid activation functions.  Our results demonstrate 
that complex-valued neural nets could be much more accurate than real-valued
neural nets at complex-valued MRI fingerprinting.
