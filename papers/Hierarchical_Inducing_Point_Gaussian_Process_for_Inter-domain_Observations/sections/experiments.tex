\section{EXPERIMENTS}
Due to the mismatch in missions of different scalable GP methods,
we focus most of our empirical study on HIP-GP and SVGP (with Cholesky whitening)
which serve the most similar purposes. We also include in appendix a standard GP problem on a UCI benchmark dataset \citep{Dua:2019} where we compare HIP-GP to exact GP \citep{wang2019exact}, sparse Gaussian Process regression (SGPR) \citep{titsias2009variational} and SVGP.

\subsection{Standard GP Study}
The main goal of this section is to investigate the predictive accuracy and
the speed of the HIP-GP in standard GP problems of moderate-sized dataset
($N <$ 200{,}000).
We use SVGP with Cholesky whitening strategy as baseline. For all experiments,
we fix the same hyper-parameters for HIPGP and SVGP; and we fix the number of PCG
iterations to $20$ for training and $50$ for evaluation for HIPGP.
