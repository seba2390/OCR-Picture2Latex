% 1) inter-domain problems
% 2) approximation accuracy --scaling issue

We examine the general problem of inter-domain Gaussian Processes (GPs):
problems where the GP realization and
the noisy observations of that realization lie on different domains.
When the mapping between those domains is linear,
such as integration or differentiation,
inference is still closed form.
However, many of the scaling and approximation techniques
that our community has developed do not apply to this setting.
In this work, we introduce
the \emph{hierarchical inducing point GP} (HIP-GP),
a scalable inter-domain GP inference method
that enables us to improve the approximation accuracy
by increasing the number of inducing points to the millions.
HIP-GP, which
relies on inducing points with grid structure and a stationary kernel assumption,
is suitable for low-dimensional problems.
In developing HIP-GP, we introduce (1) a fast whitening strategy,
and (2) a novel preconditioner for conjugate gradients which
can be helpful in general GP settings.
