\section{Translations}
\label{sec:trans}

In this section, we describe our translations from {\fg} to {\cg} and
vice-versa, thus showing that these two type systems are equally
expressive. We start with the translation from {\fg} to {\cg}.




%% In this section we give a type-preserving translation from {\fg} to {\cg}, the missing direction
%% from~\cite{siglog17-ifcComp}. To explain this, we first recap the key elements of the translation from {\rfg}
%% (a fragment of {\fg}) to {\cg} from~\cite{siglog17-ifcComp} in Section~\ref{sec:recap}. Then we describe a
%% type-preserving translation from {\fg} to {\rfg} (in Section~\ref{sec:fg-2-rfg}) as a stepping stone
%% to achieve the full translation from {\fg} to {\cg}. And finally we use the insights from {\fg} to
%% {\rfg} translation to achieve a direct translation from the whole of {\fg} to {\cg} in
%% Section~\ref{sec:fg-2-cg}.
