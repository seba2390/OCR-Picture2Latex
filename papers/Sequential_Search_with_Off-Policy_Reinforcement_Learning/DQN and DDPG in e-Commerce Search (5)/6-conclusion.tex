\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a previously unexplored class of machine learning problems, Sequential Search, that closely parallels Sequential Recommendation but comes with its own set of challenges and modeling requirements. We present three successively more advanced sequential models, DIN-S, RNN, and S3DDPG, to exploit the rich source of historical interactions between the user and the search platform. Practical techniques such as user session training data format, knapsack rearrangement of session sequence, and online incremental serving are discussed extensively. Finally systematic offline experiments on a large scale industrial dataset are performed, showing significant incremental improvement between all successive model pairs. These results are further validated with substantial gains in online A/B tests, showing that principled modeling of users' sequential behavior information can significantly improve user experience and personalized search relevance.

% We present a comprehensive modeling framework to incorporate elements of reinforcement learning into the personalized e-commerce search system. We demonstrate massive improvements from the DNN to RNN, as well as from RNN to DPPG. The latter exhibits long term user engagement improvements, as well as significant gains in result diversity and personalization coverage. The use of specialized data structure and RNN input optimization facilitate efficient training. By updating the user state daily, the model is trained at a relatively low frequency (weekly) while still retains the latest user information, thus is capable of handling much larger data/model size than a non-sequential network structure.
