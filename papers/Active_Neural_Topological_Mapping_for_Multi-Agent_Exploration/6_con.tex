\section{Conclusion and Limitations}
We propose \emph{Multi-Agent Topological Neural Mapping} (\name), a multi-agent topological exploration framework, to improve exploration efficiency and generalization. In {\name}, the Topological Mapper constructs graphs via a visual encoder and distance-based heuristics. The RL-based Hierarchical Topological Planner (\planner) captures the relationships between agents and graph nodes to infer global goals. Experiments in Habitat demonstrate that {\name} outperforms planning-based baselines and RL variants in unseen scenes. However, there is a huge room for improvement in {\name}. For example, our method leverages metric maps to prune graphs, thus the precision of the metric map may influence the quality of the topological maps. Besides, we assume fully synchronized decision-making, which may fail in environments with communication latency. 

% Learning communication protocols for limited bandwidth~\cite{NIPS2016_c7635bfd} is a future research direction.
% Moreover, our experiments focus on a small number of agents due to the low data efficiency of MAPPO~\cite{mappo}, which may be tackled by combining {\name} with curriculum learning~\cite{epciclr2020}.
