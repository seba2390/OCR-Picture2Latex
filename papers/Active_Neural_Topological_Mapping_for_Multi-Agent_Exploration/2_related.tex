\subsection{Multi-Agent Exploration} 
In classical visual exploration, agents first perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)~\cite{SLAM1} to locate their position and reconstruct 2D maps from sensory signals. They then utilize search-based planning algorithms to generate valid exploration trajectories. Representative works mainly include frontier-based methods~\cite{RRT,CoScan}, sampling-based methods~\cite{sample1,sample2}, and graph-based methods~\cite{normalized_frontier,Voronoi}. However, these solutions suffer from expensive computational costs and limited representation capabilities. Recently, deep reinforcement learning~\cite{cvpr22,RL_multi2, yang2023learning} has attracted significant attention due to its powerful expressiveness. 
NeuralCoMapping~\cite{cvpr22} utilizes a multiplex graph neural network to choose effective frontiers as global goals. MAANS~\cite{RL_multi2} uses a transformer-based architecture to infer spatial relationships and intra-agent interactions. However, all these approaches are based on metric maps, which are sensitive to different scene structures and result in subpar generalization. In this paper, we introduce an RL-based topological approach for efficient exploration and superior generalization in unseen scenarios.\looseness=-1



%EMAC~\cite{multiagent-RL} exploits the spatial inductive bias for effective exploration in an end-to-end fashion. autonomous topological map construction and a hierarchical goal selection. Many works leverage the spatial inductive bias for effective exploration via an end-to-end fashion~\cite{multiagent-RL}, spatial-teamformer~\cite{RL_multi2}, and bipartite graph~\cite{cvpr22}.
% Nevertheless, it is challenging to optimize multiple policies jointly with high search space dimensions in MARL, which results in training inefficiency and sub-optimal solutions in complex environments. 


\subsection{Spatial Representation}
Spatial representation usually includes two main types of maps: metric and topological maps. Metric maps are grid maps where each grid predicts its traversability~\cite{ans,save}. However, metric maps struggle with generalization due to significant structural variations across different scenes.
In contrast, topological maps~\cite{graph_generalization} abstractly preserve essential environmental features with nodes and edges, offering a potential solution for improved generalization.
Several works~\cite{topo_exploration,topo-map4} are based on pre-built graphs, focusing on graph refinement or finding optimal paths for coverage.
Recent literature~\cite{vgm,topo-map2,norl} utilizes active topological mapping for navigation tasks. For instance, \cite{vgm} employs the cosine similarity of visual embeddings to construct graphs. However, it requires expert trajectories which are difficult to acquire in the NP-hard multi-agent exploration problem.
Furthermore, \cite{norl} leverages depth images to predict explored/unexplored nodes, while \cite{topo-map2} utilizes semantics for approximate geometric reasoning in topological representations.
However, \cite{norl,topo-map2} requires a predefined goal to predict the geodesic distance from unexplored nodes and select a node with the shortest predicted distance. This is unsuitable for multi-agent exploration where there are no pre-defined goals. 
In this work, we introduce an RL-based Hierarchical Topological Planner to effectively apply active topological mapping in multi-agent exploration. \looseness=-1

\subsection{Graph Neural Networks}
Graph neural networks (GNNs)~\cite{gnn} are widely utilized in multi-agent systems to model interactions between agents. 
\cite{gnn_hierarchical} proposes a hierarchical graph attention network that captures the underlying relationships at the agent and the group level, thereby improving generalization. \cite{vgm} considers GNN as an encoder for mapping tasks to extract node features from images. Additionally, \cite{cvpr22} formulates exploration tasks as bipartite graph matching. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical goal selector based on GNN to capture the correlations between agents and topological maps in a coarse-to-fine manner.\looseness=-1
