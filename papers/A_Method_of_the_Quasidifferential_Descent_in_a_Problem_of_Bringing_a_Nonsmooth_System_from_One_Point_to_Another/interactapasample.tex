\begin{abstract}
The paper considers the problem of constructing program control for an object described by a system with nonsmooth (but only quasidifferentiable) right-hand side. The goal of control is to bring such a system from a given initial position to a given final state in certain finite time. The admissible controls are piecewise continuous and bounded vector-functions with values from some parallelepiped. The original problem is reduced to unconditional minimization of some penalty functional which takes into account constraints in the form of differential equations, constraints on the initial and the final positions of the object as well as constraints on controls. Moreover, it is known that this functional vanishes on the solution of the original problem and only on it. The quasidifferentiability of this functional is proved, necessary and sufficient conditions for its minimum are written out in terms of quasidifferential. Further, in order to solve the obtained minimization problem in the functional space the method of quasidifferential descent is applied. The algorithm developed is demonstrated by examples.

\section{Introduction}
Despite the rich arsenal of methods accumulated over the more than 60-year history of the development of optimal control theory, most of them deal with classical systems whose right-hand sides are continuously differentiable functions of their arguments. There are approaches that do not require these smoothness conditions on systems. However, they usually use direct discretization or some kind of ``smoothing'' process; both of these approaches lead to losing some of the information about  ``behavior'' of the system as well as to finite-dimensional problems of huge dimensions. The paper presented is aimed at solving the problem of bringing a nonsmooth (but only quasidifferentiable) system from one point to another. The relevance of considering such systems is due to their ability to more accurately and more fully describe the ``behavior'' of an object in many cases.

In order to solve the problem of this paper, we will use a combination of reducing the original problem to the problem of minimizing a functional in some functional space as well as the apparatus of quasidifferential calculus. The concept of ``quasidifferential'' was introduced by V. F. Demyanov. A rich and constructive calculus has been developed for this nonsmooth optimization object (see \cite{demrub}). In a finite-dimensional case quasidifferntiable functions are those whose directional derivative may be represented as a sum of the maximum of the scalar product of the direction and the vector from a convex compact set (called a subdifferential) and of the minimum of the scalar product of the direction and the vector from a convex compact (called a superdifferential). The pair of a subdifferential and a superdifferential is called a quasidifferential. (See the strict definition of quasidifferential applied to the right-hand sides of the system below). The class of quasidifferentiable functions is wide. In particular, it includes all the functions that can be represented as a superposition of the finite number of maxima and minima of continuously differentiable functions. The concept of quasidifferential was generalized onto functional spaces in the works of M. V. Dolgopolik (see, e. g.  \cite{dolgopolik1}, \cite{Dolgopolikcodiff}).

Let us make a brief review of some papers on nonsmooth control problems. Such works as \cite{Vinter1}, \cite{Vinter2}, \cite{Frankowska}, \cite{Mordukhovich}, \cite{Ioffe}, \cite{Shvartsman} are devoted to classical necessary optimality conditions in the form of the maximum principle for nonsmooth control problems in various formulations (including the case of the presence of phase constraints). In paper \cite{ito} the minimum conditions in the form of Karush---Kuhn---Tucker are obtained  for nonsmooth problems of mathematical programming in a general problem statement with applications to nonsmooth problems of optimal control. In paper \cite{olivera} on the basis of ``maximum principle invexity'' some sufficient conditions are obtained for nonsmooth control problems. The author of the paper presented also constructed some theoretical results in the problem of program control in systems whose right hand-sides contain modules of linear functions; 
in this problem the necessary minimum conditions are obtained in terms of quasidifferentials (see \cite{Fominyh2}). For the first time, quasidifferential (in the finite-dimensional case) was used to study nonsmooth control problems in work \cite{demshablnik}. The works listed are mainly of theoretical nature; and it is difficult to apply rather complex minimum conditions obtained there to specific control problems with systems with nonsmooth right-hand sides. Let us mention some works devoted directly to the construction of numerical methods for solving a problem similar to that considered in this paper. The author of this paper used the methods of subdifferential and hypodifferential descents earlier to construct optimal control with a subdifferentiable cost functional and the system with a continuously differentiable right-hand side (\cite{Fominyh1}) as well as to solve the problem of bringing a continuously differentiable system from one point to another (in paper \cite{Fominyh3}). In work \cite{Fominyh4} a finite-dimensional version of the quasidifferential descent method was applied to the optimal control problem in Mayer form with smooth right-hand side of a system and with a nondifferentiable objective functional. In work \cite{outrata} the optimal control problem is considered which assumes, roughly speaking, the subdifferentiability of an objective functional and continuous differentiability of right-hand sides of a system. The approach of this work is based on minimization of the discretized augmented cost functional via bundle methods. In papers \cite{Gorelik1}, \cite{Gorelik2} the minimax control problem is considered; with the help of a specially constructed smooth penalty function it is reduced to a classical continuously differentiable problem. In work \cite{Morzhin} a subdifferentiable penalty function is constructed in order to take the constraints on control into account; after that the subdifferential smoothing process is also used. In papers \cite{Mayne1}, \cite{Mayne2} the exact penalty function constructed (in order to take phase constraints into account) is also subdifferentiable; an algorithm for minimizing the derivative of this function with respect to the direction is considered. After ``transition'' to continuously differentiable problems a widely developed arsenal for solving classical control problems can be used in order to solve them. In works \cite{Skandari1}, \cite{Skandari2} more general problems are considered in which the nonsmoothness of right-hand sides of the system describing a controlled object is allowed. Here with the help of basis functions (Fourier series) the smoothing of system right-hand sides is also carried out, after which the Chebyshev pseudospectral method is used to solve the problem. In paper \cite{RossFahroo} the direct method for optimizing trajectories of nonsmooth optimal control problems is proposed based on the Legendre's pseudospectral method.

The method considered in this paper belongs to the so called direct methods of the variational analysis (see \cite{demtam}). The method is also ``continuous'' unlike most methods in literature as it is not based on direct discretization of the original problem. Although similar methods have already been applied to some problems of variational calculus and optimal control, so far it was impossible to apply this  method to nonsmooth control problems. The main difficulty was in a too complicated form of  quasidifferentials and optimality conditions obtained. The new technical idea of the current paper is to consider phase trajectory and its derivative as independent variables (and to take the natural relation between these variables into account via penalty function of a special form). To the best of the author's knowledge, this idea is used in literature for the first time. It allowed to simplify the quasidifferential structure of the functional under consideration and to solve the problem of finding the steepest descent direction of the minimized functional. 

\section{Basic Definitions and Notation}
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the notation of the paper as well as definitions of the quasidifferentials of the functions (the functionals) required. In Section~3 the problem statement and the main assumptions are presented. In Section~4 the original problem is reduced to the unconstrained minimization one. The quasidifferentiability of the main functional is proved in Section 5; after that minimum conditions for the unconstrained problem are obtained. The quasidifferential descent method is described in Section 6. In this section we also discuss the methods for solving the auxiliary problems arising during the basic algorithm implementation. Justification of possibility of finding the steepest descent direction at discrete time moments is carried out in the section as well. Section 7 contains the numerical examples illustrating the method realization with a rather detailed analysis of the problems considered. In Section 8 advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed. Section~9 summarizes the main results of the paper. Finally, Appendix contains some known quasidifferential rules description applied to the specific functional considered.    

In the paper we will use the following notations. $C_{n} [0, T]$ is the space of continuous on $[0, T]$ $n$-dimensional vector-functions; $P_{n} [0, T]$ is the space of piecewise continuous and bounded on $[0, T]$ $n$-dimensional vector-functions. Denote $L_p^n [0, T]$, $1 \leqslant p < \infty$, the space of measurable on $[0, T]$ $n$-dimensional vector-functions which are summable with the degree $p$, also denote $L_\infty^n [0, T]$ the space of measurable on $[0, T]$ and a. e. bounded  $n$-dimensional vector-functions. If the function $p(t)$ is defined on the segment~$[0, T]$ and $\overline T$ is some subset of this segment, then $p(t) |_{\overline T} $ denotes its restriction to this set. Denote $ \mathrm{co} P $ a convex hull of the set $P \subset R^n$. The sum $E + F$ of the sets $E, F \subset R^n$ is their Minkowski sum, while $\lambda E$ with $\lambda \in R$ is the Minkowski product. Let $B_r(c)$ ($D_r(c)$) denote a closed (an open) ball of some space with the radius $r > 0$ and with the center $c$ from this space; herewith, for some set $C$ (from the same space) $B_r(C)$ ($D_r(C)$) denotes the union of all closed (open) balls with the radius $r > 0$ and the centers from the set $C$. Denote $\langle a, b \rangle$ the scalar product of the vectors $a$, $b$ $\in R^d$. Let~$X$ be a normed space, then $||\cdot||_X$ denotes the norm in this space, and $X^*$ denotes the space, conjugate to the space $X$. Finally, for some number $\alpha$ let $o(\alpha)$ denote such a value that $o (\alpha) / \alpha \rightarrow 0 \ \text{if} \ \alpha \rightarrow 0$.

In the paper we will use both quasidifferentials of functions in a finite-dimensional space and quasidifferentials of functionals
in a functional space. Despite the fact that the second concept generalizes the first one, for convenience we separately introduce
definitions for both of these cases and for those specific functions (functionals) and their variables and spaces which are
considered in the paper.

Consider the space $R^n \times R^m$ with the standard norm. Let $g = [g_1, g_2] \in R^n \times R^m$ be an arbitrary vector. Suppose that at every time moment $t \in [0, T]$ at the point $(x, u)$ there exist such convex compact sets $\underline \partial f_i(x,u,t)$, $\overline \partial f_i(x,u,t)$ $\subset R^n \times R^m$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, that 
\begin{equation}
\label{3} 
\frac{\partial f_i(x,u,t)}{\partial g} = \lim_{\alpha \downarrow 0} \frac{1}{\alpha} \big(f_i(x+\alpha g_1, u + \alpha g_2, t) - f_i(x,u,t)\big) = \end{equation}
$$
= \max_{v \in \underline \partial f_i(x,u,t)} \langle v, g \rangle + \min_{w \in \overline \partial f_i(x,u,t)} \langle w, g \rangle, \quad i = \overline {1, n}. 
$$

In this case the function $f_i(x,u,t)$, $i = \overline{1,n}$, is called quasidifferentiable at the point $(x, u)$ and the pair $\mathcal{D}f_i(x, u) = \big[ \underline \partial f_i(x,u,t),  \overline \partial f_i(x,u,t) \big]$ is called a quasidifferential of the function $f_i(x,u,t)$ (herewith, the sets $\underline \partial f_i(x,u,t)$ and $\overline \partial f_i(x,u,t)$ are called a subdifferential and a superdifferential respectively of the function $f_i(x,u,t)$ at the point $(x,u)$). 

From expression (\ref{3}) one can see that at each $t \in [0, T]$ the following formula 
\begin{equation}
\label{3''} f_i(x + \alpha g_1, u + \alpha g_2, t) = f_i(x, u, t) + \alpha  \frac{\partial f_i(x,u,t)}{\partial g} + o_i(\alpha, x, u, g, t), \end{equation}
$$\quad  \frac{o_i(\alpha, x, u, g, t)}{\alpha} \rightarrow 0, \ \alpha \downarrow 0, \quad i = \overline {1, n},$$
holds true.

If for each number $\varepsilon > 0$ there exist such numbers $\delta > 0$ and $\alpha_0 > 0$ that at $\overline g \in B_{\delta}(g)$ and at $\alpha \in (0, \alpha_0)$ one has $| o_i(\alpha, x, u, \overline g, t) | < \alpha \varepsilon $, $i = \overline {1, n}$, then the function $f_i(x,u,t)$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, is called uniformly quasidifferentiable at the point $(x, u)$. Note (\cite{demvas}) that if at each $t \in [0, T]$ the function $f_i(x,u,t)$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, is quasidifferentiable at the point $(x, u)$ and is locally Lipschitz continuous in the vicinity of the point $(x, u)$, then it is uniformly quasidifferentiable at the point $(x, u)$. If for the uniformly quasidifferentiable function $f_i(x,u,t)$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, in expression (\ref{3''}) one has $\displaystyle{\frac{o_i(\alpha, x, u, g, t)}{\alpha} \rightarrow 0}$, $\alpha \downarrow 0$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$, then such a function is called absolutely uniformly quasidifferentiable.
%Будем также считать, что функция $\displaystyle{\frac{\partial f_i(x,u,t)}{\partial g}}$ измерима по Лебегу по $t \in [0, T]$ при любых фиксированных векторах $(x, u)$ и $g$. 

Consider the space $C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ with the following norm: \linebreak $L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]$. Let $g = [g_1, g_2, g_3] \in C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ be an arbitrary vector-function. Suppose that at the point $(x, z, u)$ there exist such convex weakly* compact sets $\underline \partial {I(x, z, u)}, \overline \partial {I(x, z, u)} \subset \big( C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T],$ $|| \cdot ||_{L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]} \big) ^*$ that  
\begin{equation}
\label{3'} 
\frac{\partial I(x, z, u)}{\partial g} = \lim_{\alpha \downarrow 0} \frac{1}{\alpha} \big(I(x+\alpha g_1, z+\alpha g_2, u + \alpha g_3) - I(x, z, u)\big) =  \end{equation}
$$
= \max_{v \in \underline \partial I(x, z, u)} v(g) + \min_{w \in \overline \partial I(x, z, u)} w(g).
$$

In this case the functional $I(x,z,u)$ is called quasidifferentiable at the point $(x, z, u)$ and the pair $\mathcal{D}I(x, z, u) = \big[ \underline \partial {I(x, z, u)},  \overline \partial {I(x, z, u)} \big]$ is called a quasidifferential of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ (herewith, the sets $\underline \partial {I(x, z, u)}$ and $\overline \partial {I(x, z, u)}$ are called a \linebreak subdifferential and a superdifferential respectively of the functional $I(x,z,u)$ at the point $(x,z,u)$). 

From expression (\ref{3'}) one can see that the following formula 
\begin{equation}
\label{6''} 
I(x + \alpha g_1, z + \alpha g_2, u + \alpha g_3) = I(x, z, u) + \alpha  \frac{\partial I(x,z,u)}{\partial g} + o(\alpha, x, z, u, g),
\end{equation} 
$$ \quad  \frac{o(\alpha, x, z, u, g)}{\alpha} \rightarrow 0, \ \alpha \downarrow 0,$$
holds true.

\section{Statement of the Problem}

Consider the system of ordinary differential equations
\begin{equation}
\label{1}
\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t),u(t),t) 
\end{equation}
with the initial point
\begin{equation}
\label{2}
x(0) = x_{0}.
\end{equation}
%и конечным условием
%\begin{equation} 
%\label{3} 
%%(x_{i_1}(T), \dots, x_{i_p}(T)) = x_T, \quad \{i_1, \dots i_p\} \subset \{1, \dots, n\}, \ p < n. 
%\Phi(x(T)) = {\bf 0}_p.
%\end{equation}

In formula (\ref{1}) $f(x,u,t)$, $t~\in~[0, T]$, is a given $n$-dimensional vector-function; $T > 0$ is a known finite time moment. In formula (\ref{2}) $x_0 \in R^n$ is a given vector. 

{\bf Assumption 1.} The $n$-dimensional vector-function $x(t)$ of phase coordinates is assumed to be continuous and continuously differentiable at every $t \in [0, T]$ with the exception of, possibly, only the finite number of points (herewith, we suppose that its derivative is bounded on its domain). The $m$-dimensional vector-function $u(t)$ of controls is supposed to be piecewise continuous and bounded on $[0, T]$. The vector-function $f(x,u,t)$ is supposed to be continuous; and each of its components $f_i(x, u, t)$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, --- to be quasidifferentiable and locally Lipschitz continuous in the pair $(x, u)$ of variables at each fixed $t \in [0, T]$. 

Under the assumptions made for system (\ref{1}), (\ref{2}), the classical solution existence and uniqueness theorems hold true, at least, in some neighborhood of the initial point. 

As noted above, in the paper we assume that each trajectory $x(t)$ is a piecewise continuously differentiable vector-function with bounded on its domain derivative and $u(t)$ is a piecewise continuous and bounded vector-function. If $t_0 \in [0, T)$ is a discontinuity point of the vector-function $u(t)$, then for definiteness we assume that $u(t_0) = \lim \limits_{t \downarrow t_0} u(t)$. At the point $T$ put $u(T) = \lim \limits_{t \uparrow T} u(t)$. So we also assume that $\dot x(t_0)$ is a right-hand derivative of the vector-function $x(t)$ at the point $t_0$ and that $\dot x(T)$ is a left-hand derivative of the vector-function $x(t)$ at the point $T$. With the assumptions and the notations made we can suppose that the vector-function $x(t)$ belongs to the space $C_n [0, T]$, the vector-function $\dot x(t)$ belongs to the space $P_n [0, T]$ and the vector-function $u(t)$ belongs to the space $P_m [0, T]$.

%Напомним определение квазидифференцируемой функции и квазидифференциала. Пусть имеется некоторое непустое множество $\Sigma \subset R^n$. Функция $\xi: \Sigma \rightarrow {\bf R}$ называется квазидифференцируемой на множестве $\Sigma$, если для каждого $\varsigma \in \Sigma$ существуют такие выпуклые компактные множества, субдифференциал $\underline \partial \xi(\varsigma) \subset R^n$ и супердифференциал $\overline \partial \xi(\varsigma) \subset R^n$, что для каждого допустимого приращения $\Delta \varsigma \in R^n$ (то есть co$\{ \varsigma, \varsigma + \Delta \varsigma \} \in \Sigma $) соответствующее приращение функции $\xi$ представимо по формуле 
%$$ \xi(\varsigma+\Delta \varsigma) = \xi(\varsigma) + \max_{\sigma_1 \in {\underline \partial}\xi(\varsigma)} \langle \sigma_1, \Delta \varsigma \rangle + \min_{\sigma_2 \in {\overline \partial}\xi(\varsigma)} \langle \sigma_2, \Delta \varsigma \rangle + o (\Delta \varsigma, \varsigma), $$
%$$ \text{где} \ o (\alpha \Delta \varsigma, \varsigma) / \alpha \rightarrow 0, \quad \text{если} \ \alpha \rightarrow 0. $$
%Пара $\mathcal{D} \xi (\varsigma) = [{\underline{\partial}} \xi(\varsigma), {\overline{\partial}} \xi(\varsigma)]$ называется квазидифференциалом функции $\xi$ в точке $\varsigma$.

%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation} 
%\label{4''} 
%U_2 = \big\{ u \in P_m[0, T] \ | \ \underline{u}_i \leq u_i(t) \leq \overline{u}_i, \ i = \overline{1, m}, \ t \in [0, T] \big\}.

Introduce the set of admissible controls
\begin{equation} 
\label{4''} 
U  = \big\{ u \in P_m[0, T] \ | \ \underline{u}_i \leq u_i(t) \leq \overline{u}_i, \ i = \overline{1, m}, \ t \in [0, T] \big\}.
\end{equation}
Here $\underline{u}_i, \overline{u}_i \in R, i = \overline{1, m}$, are given numbers.

It is required to find such a control $u^{*} \in U$ that brings the corresponding trajectory~$x^*(t)$ from initial point (\ref{2}) to the final state 
\begin{equation} 
\label{5}
x(T) = x_{T},
\end{equation}
where $x_T \in R^n$ is a given vector. 
\newline

{\bf Assumption 2.} We suppose that there exists such a solution.


\section{Reduction to an Unconstrained Minimization Problem}
Construct the functional taking into account different constraints on the object and on control which are given in the statement of the problem. Let $z(t) = \dot x (t)$ (under the assumptions made, $z \in P_n[0,T]$), then according to (\ref{2}) (where the initial state of the system is given) we have \begin{equation} 
\label{6} \displaystyle{x(t) = x_0 + \int_0^t z(\tau) d \tau}. \end{equation}
 
Construct the following functional on the space $P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$:
$$ \overline I(z, u) = \sum_{i=1}^n \int_0^T \Big| z_i (t) - f_i\Big(x_0 + \int_0^t z(\tau) d \tau, u(t), t\Big) \Big | dt + \frac{1}{2} \Big( x_0 + \int_0^T z(t) dt - x_T \Big)^2 + $$
$$ + \sum_{i=1}^m \int_0^T \max \big\{\underline{u}_i - u_i(t), 0 \big\} dt + \sum_{i=1}^m \int_0^T \max \big\{{u}_i(t) - \overline{u}_i(t), 0 \big\} dt. $$
In the functional $\overline I(z, u)$ the first summand (which is a sum) takes into account differential constraint (\ref{1}), the second summand takes into account constraint (\ref{5}) on the final state of the system, the third summand (consisting of two sums) takes into account constraint (\ref{4''}) on control. Note that this functional is nonnegative for any of its arguments and $\overline I (z^*, u^*)  = 0$ iff the pair $(x^*, u^*) \in C_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ is a solution of the original problem, i. e. the control $u^*$ belongs to the set $U$ of admissible controls and brings the corresponding trajectory $\displaystyle{x^*(t) = x_0 + \int_0^t z^*(\tau) d \tau}$ from the given initial position $x_0$ to the given final state $x_T$ in the time~$T$.

Transition to the ``space of derivatives'' $\left( z \in P_n[0, T] \right)$ has been used in many works of V. F. Demyanov and his students to study various variational and control problems. Under some natural additional assumptions one can
prove the quasidifferentiability of the functional $\overline I (z, u)$ in the space $P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ as a normed space with the norm $L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]$. However, the quasidifferential of this functional has a rather complicated structure which makes it practically unsuitable for constructing numerical methods. Therefore, in this paper it is proposed to consider some
modification of this functional, ``forcibly'' considering the points $z$ and $x$ to be ``independent'' variables. Since, in fact, there is relationship (\ref{6}) between these variables (which naturally means that the vector-function $z(t)$ is a derivative of the vector-function $x(t)$), let us take it into account by adding the corresponding (last) term when constructing the new functional on the space
 $C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$:   
$$
I(x, z, u) = I_1(x, z, u) + I_2(z) + I_3(u) + I_4(x, z) = $$
\begin{equation} 
\label{7}
= \sum_{i=1}^n \int_0^T \big| z_i (t) - f_i(x(t), u(t), t) \big | dt + \frac{1}{2} \Big( x_0 + \int_0^T z(t) dt - x_T \Big)^2 + 
\end{equation}
$$ + \sum_{i=1}^m \int_0^T \max \{\underline{u}_i - u_i(t), 0 \} dt + \sum_{i=1}^m \int_0^T \max \{{u}_i(t) - \overline{u}_i, 0 \} dt + $$ $$ + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T \Big( x(t) - x_0 - \int_0^t z(\tau) d \tau \Big)^2 dt. $$
Note that this functional is also nonnegative for any of its arguments and $ I (x^*, z^*, u^*)  = 0$ iff the pair $(x^*, u^*) \in C_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ is a solution of the original problem, i. e. the control $u^*$ belongs to the set $U$ of admissible controls and brings the corresponding trajectory $\displaystyle{x^*(t) = x_0 + \int_0^t z^*(\tau) d \tau}$ from the given initial position $x_0$ to the given final state $x_T$ in the time $T$. It is obvious that if some of the right endpoint coordinates of an object are free, then we put the corresponding summands of the functional $I_2(z)$ equal to zero. It is also obvious that if some of the restrictions on controls are absent, one has to remove the corresponding summands from the functional~$I_3(u)$. In both these cases we keep for the functional $I(x,z,u)$ its notation.  

Despite the fact that the dimension of functional $I(x, z, u)$ arguments is $n$ more the dimension of functional $\overline I(z, u)$ arguments, the structure of its quasidifferential (in the space $C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ as a normed space with the norm \linebreak $L_2^n [0, T] \times \times L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]$), as will be seen from what follows, is much simpler than the structure of the functional $\overline I(z, u)$ quasidifferential. This will allow us to construct
a numerical method for solving the original problem. 

Thus, the initial problem has been reduced to finding an unconstrained global minimum point of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ on the space $$X = \Big( C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T], || \cdot ||_{L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]} \Big).$$

\begin{remark}
Note the following fact. Since, as is known, the space $\Big( C_n[0, T], || \cdot ||_{L_2^n [0, T]} \Big)$ is everywhere dense in the space ${L_2^n [0, T]}$ and the space $\Big( P_n[0, T], || \cdot ||_{L_2^n [0, T]} \Big)$ is also everywhere dense in the space ${L_2^n [0, T]}$, then the space $X^*$ conjugate to the space $X$ introduced in the previous paragraph is isometrically isomorphic to the space ${L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^n [0, T] \times L_2^m [0, T]}$ (see \cite{kolfom}).
\end{remark}

\section{Minimum Conditions of the Functional $I(x, z, u)$ }
Let us formulate a necessary and sufficient minimum condition for the functional $I(x, z, u)$ that follows from its construction.

\begin{theorem}
Let Assumptions 1, 2 be satisfied. In order for the point $(x^*, z^*, u^*)$ to minimize the functional $I(x, z, u)$, it is necessary and sufficient to have $I(x^*, z^*, u^*) =~0$.
\end{theorem}

In order to obtain a more constructive (than that given in Theorem 5.1) minimum condition useful for constructing
numerical methods for solving the problem posed, first, let us investigate the differential properties of the functional $I(x, z, u)$.

Using the classical variation one can directly prove the Gateaux differentiability of the functional $I_2(z)$; we have
% \begin{equation}
% \label{8}
$$
 \nabla I_2(z) = x_0 + \int_0^T z(t) dt - x_T.  
 $$
 % \end{equation}
 By quasidifferential calculus rules (\cite{DolgNormed}, Example 3.1) one may put 
 $$ \mathcal{D} \, I_2(z) = \big[ \underline \partial I_2(z), \, \overline \partial I_2(z) \big] = \bigg[ x_0 + \int_0^T z(t) dt - x_T, \ 0_n \bigg]. $$
 
 Using the classical variation and integration by parts one can directly check (cf., e.~g. \cite{demtam}, Formula (14)) the Gateaux differentiability of the functional $I_4(x, z)$; we obtain
% \begin{equation}
% \label{9}
 $$\nabla I_4(x, z, t) = \begin{pmatrix}
\displaystyle{ x(t) - x_0 - \int_0^t z(\tau) d\tau } \\
\displaystyle{ -\int_t^T \Big( x(\tau) - x_0 - \int_0^\tau z(s) ds \Big) d\tau  }
\end{pmatrix}. 
$$   
% \end{equation}
 
  By quasidifferential calculus rules (\cite{DolgNormed}, Example 3.1) one may put 
 $$ \mathcal{D} \, I_4(x, z) = \big[ \underline \partial I_4(x, z), \, \overline \partial I_4(x, z) \big] = \left[ \begin{pmatrix}
\displaystyle{ x(t) - x_0 - \int_0^t z(\tau) d\tau } \\
\displaystyle{ -\int_t^T \Big( x(\tau) - x_0 - \int_0^\tau z(s) ds \Big) d\tau  }
\end{pmatrix}, \ 0_{2n} \right ]. $$
 
 Study now the differential properties of the functionals $I_1(x, z, u)$ and $I_3(u)$. For this, we prove the following theorem for a functional of a more general form. 
 
\begin{theorem} 
 Let the functional
 $$
 J(\xi) = \int_0^T \varphi(\xi(t), t) dt
 $$
be given where $\xi \in P_l[0, T]$, the function $\varphi(\xi, t)$ is continuous and is also absolutely uniformly quasidifferentiable, with the quasidifferential $[\underline \partial \varphi(\xi, t), \overline \partial \varphi(\xi, t)]$. Suppose also that the mappings $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ and $t \rightarrow \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t) $ are upper semicontinuous.  

Then the functional $J(\xi)$ is quasidifferentiable, i. e. 

1) The derivative of the functional $J(\xi)$ in the direction $g$ exists and is of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{10} 
\frac{\partial J(\xi)}{\partial g} = \lim_{\alpha \downarrow 0} \frac{1}{\alpha} \big(J(\xi+\alpha g) - J(\xi)\big) =  \end{equation}
$$
= \max_{v \in \underline \partial J(\xi)} \int_0^T \langle v(t), g(t) \rangle dt + \min_{w \in \overline \partial J(\xi)} \int_0^T \langle w(t), g(t) \rangle dt
$$
 where $g \in P_l[0,T]$, and the sets $\underline \partial J(\xi)$, $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ are of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{12}  
 \underline \partial J(\xi) = \Big\{ v \in L^l_\infty[0, T] \ \big| \ v(t) \in  \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t) \ \forall t \in [0, T] \Big\},
 \end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
\label{13} 
 \overline \partial J(\xi) = \Big\{ w \in L^l_\infty[0, T]  \ \big| \ w(t) \in  \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t) \ \forall t \in [0, T] \Big\}.
 \end{equation} 
 
 2) The sets $\underline \partial J(\xi)$, $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ are convex and weakly* compact subsets of the space $\big( P_l[0, T], || \cdot ||_{L_2^l [0, T]} \big)^*$. 
 \end{theorem}
 
\begin{proof}
%In accordance with definition (\ref{3'}) of a quasidifferentiable functional in order to prove the theorem one has to check that: 
%
%1) the derivative of the functional $J(\xi)$ in the direction $g$ exists and is actually of form (\ref{10}), 
%
%2) herewith, the sets $\underline \partial J(\xi)$, $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ are convex and weakly* compact subsets of the space $\big( P_l[0, T], || \cdot ||_{L_2^l [0, T]} \big)^*$. 

Prove statement 1). 

Insofar as the function $\varphi(\xi, t)$ is quasidifferentiable by assumption, then for every $g \in P_l[0,T]$ and for each $\alpha > 0$ we have (see formula (\ref{3''}))
\begin{equation}
\label{16} 
J(\xi+\alpha g) - J(\xi) =  \int_0^T \max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt + \int_0^T  \min_{w \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt +
 \end{equation} 
  $$
 + \int_0^T {o(\alpha, \xi(t), g(t), t)} dt, \quad \frac{o(\alpha, \xi(t), g(t), t)}{\alpha} \rightarrow 0, \ \alpha \downarrow 0. 
 $$

At this point let us check that the integrals in the right-hand side of this formula are correctly defined. 

Insofar as $\xi, g \in P_l[0,T]$ and the function $\varphi(\xi, t)$ is continuous, one has that for each $\alpha > 0$ the functions  $t \rightarrow \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ and $t \rightarrow \varphi(\xi(t) + \alpha g(t), t)$ belong to the space~$L_\infty^1 [0,T]$.

Under the assumption made, the mappings $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ and $t \rightarrow \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ are upper semicontinuous and then are also measurable (\cite{filblag}). Then due to the piecewise continuity and the boundedness of the function $g(t)$ and due to continuity of the scalar product in its variables we obtain that for each $\alpha > 0$ the mappings $t \rightarrow \max_{v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ and $t \rightarrow \min_{w(t) \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ are upper semicontinuous (\cite{AubinFrankowska}) and then are also measurable (\cite{filblag}). During the proof of statement 2) it will be shown that under the assumptions made, the sets $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ and $\overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ are bounded uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$, from here taking into account the fact that $g \in P_l[0,T]$, check that for each $\alpha > 0$ the mappings $t \rightarrow \max_{v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ and $t \rightarrow \min_{w(t) \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ are also bounded uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$. Indeed, fix some $g \in P_l[0,T]$ and $\alpha > 0$ and for each $t \in [0,T]$ take such a vector $\overline v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ that $\langle \overline v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle = \max_{v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ (the vector~$\overline v(t)$ exists since for each $t \in [0,T]$ the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ is a convex compact). Then by Cauchy--Schwarz inequality $\langle \overline v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle \leq \alpha ||\overline v(t)||_{R^l} ||g(t)||_{R^l} $, and the value on the right-hand side is bounded (uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$) since $g \in P_l[0,T]$ and since the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ is bounded uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$. (The justification regarding the mapping $t \rightarrow \min_{w(t) \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ is carried out in a completely analogous fashion.)  So we finally have that for each $\alpha > 0$ the mappings $t \rightarrow \max_{v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ and $t \rightarrow \min_{w(t) \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle$ belong to the space $L_\infty^1 [0,T]$. 

Then for every $\alpha > 0$ one has $t \rightarrow {o(\alpha, \xi(t), g(t), t)} \in  L_\infty^1 [0,T]$ and due to
the absolutely uniformly quasidifferentiability of the function $\varphi(\xi, t)$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\label{11}  \frac{o(\alpha, \xi(t), g(t), t)}{\alpha} =: \frac{o(\alpha)}{\alpha} \rightarrow 0, \ \alpha \downarrow 0. \end{equation}

Now our aim is to ``bring the operations of taking maximum and minimum out of the integral'', i. e. to obtain the expression in the right-hand side of formula (\ref{10}).
 
Consider the functional $\displaystyle{\int_0^T \max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt}$ in detail. For each $\alpha > 0$ and for each $t \in [0, T]$ we have the obvious inequality
$$
\max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle \geqslant \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle
$$
where $v(t)$ is a measurable selector of the mapping $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ (due to
the noted boundedness property of the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi, t)$ uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$ we have $v \in L_\infty^l [0,T]$) and by virtue of formula (\ref{12}) form for every $\alpha > 0$ one has the inequality 
$$
\int_0^T \max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt \geqslant \max_{v \in \underline \partial J(\xi)} \int_0^T \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt. 
$$
Insofar as for each $\alpha > 0$ and for each $t \in [0, T]$ we have 
$$
\max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle \in \Big\{ \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle \ \big| \ v(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t) \Big\}
$$
and the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ is closed and bounded at each fixed $t$ by the definition of subdifferential and the mapping $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ is upper semicontinuous by assumption and also because the scalar product is continuous in its arguments and $g \in P_l[0,T]$, then due to Filippov lemma (see \cite{Filippov}) there exists such a measurable selector $\overline{v}(t)$ of the mapping $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ that for each $\alpha > 0$ and for each $t \in [0, T]$ we have 
$$
\max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle = \langle \overline{v}(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle,
$$
so we have found the element $\overline{v}$ from the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ which brings the equality
in the previous inequality. Thus, finally we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{14} 
\int_0^T \max_{v \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt = \max_{v \in \underline \partial J(\xi)} \int_0^T \langle v(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt. 
\end{equation}

Consideration of the functional $\displaystyle{\int_0^T \min_{w \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt}$ is carried out in a completely analogous fashion. Taking formula (\ref{13}) form into account we have
\begin{equation}
\label{15} 
\int_0^T  \min_{w \in \overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)} \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt = \min_{w \in \overline \partial J(\xi)} \int_0^T \langle w(t), \alpha g(t) \rangle dt.
\end{equation}

From expressions (\ref{16}), (\ref{11}), (\ref{14}), (\ref{15}) follows formula (\ref{10}) (see expression  (\ref{6''})). 

Prove statement 2). 

The convexity of the sets $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ and $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ immediately
follows from the convexity at each fixed $t \in [0, T]$ of the sets $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ and $\overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ respectively.

Prove the boundedness of the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$. Due to the upper
semicontinuity of the mapping $t \rightarrow \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t),t)$ at each $t \in [0, T]$ there
exists such a number $\delta(t)$ that under the condition $|\overline{t} - t| < \delta(t)$ the inclusion \linebreak $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi(\overline{t}),\overline{t}) \subset B_r(\underline \partial \varphi(\xi({t}),{t}))$ holds true at $\overline{t} \in [0, T]$ where $r$ is some fixed finite positive number. The intervals $D_{\delta(t)}(t)$, $t \in [0, T]$, form open
cover of the segment $[0, T]$, so by Heine-Borel lemma one can take a finite subcover from this cover. Hence, there exists such a number $\delta > 0$ that for every $t \in [0, T]$ the inclusion $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi(\overline{t}),\overline{t}) \subset B_r(\underline \partial \varphi(\xi({t}),{t}))$ holds true once $|\overline{t} - t| < \delta$ and $\overline{t} \in [0, T]$. This means that for the segment $[0, T]$ there exists a finite partition $t_1 = 0, t_2, \dots, t_{N-1}, t_N = T$ with the diameter $\delta$ such that $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,{t}) \subset \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^N B_r(\underline \partial \varphi(\xi({t_i}),{t_i}))$ for all $t \in [0, T]$. It remains to notice that the set $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^N B_r(\underline \partial \varphi(\xi({t_i}),{t_i}))$ is bounded due to the compactness of the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi,{t})$ at each fixed $t \in [0, T]$. The boundedness of the set $\overline \partial \varphi(\xi,t)$ uniformly in $t \in [0, T]$ may be proved similarly.

Prove that the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ is weakly closed. As shown in statement 1) proof
and at the beginning of statement 2) proof, the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ is convex and its elements $v$ belong to the space $L_\infty^l [0, T]$. Then all the more the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ is a convex subset of the space $L_2^l [0, T]$. Let us prove that the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ is closed in the weak topology of the space $L_2^l [0, T]$. Let $\{v_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be the sequence of functions from the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ converging to the function $v^*$ in the
strong topology of the space $L_2^l [0, T]$. It is known (\cite{Munroe}) that this sequence has the subsequence $\{v_{n_k}\}_{n_k=1}^{\infty}$ converging pointwise to $v^{*}$ almost everywhere on $[0, T]$, i. e. there exists such a subset $T' \subset [0, T]$ having the measure $T$ that for every point $t \in T'$ we have $v_{n_k}(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ and  $v_{n_k}(t)$ converges to $v^{*}(t)$, $n_k = 1, 2, \dots$. But the set $\underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$ is closed at each $t \in [0, T]$ by the definition of subdifferential, hence for every $t \in T'$ we have $v^{*}(t) \in \underline \partial \varphi(\xi(t), t)$. So the set $\underline \partial J(\xi)$ is closed in the strong topology of the space $L_2^l [0, T]$ but it is also convex, so it is also closed in the weak topology of the space $L_2^l [0, T]$ (\cite{DunfordSchwarz}). One can prove that the set $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ is weakly closed (in $L_2^{l}[0, T]$) in a similar way.

Recall that by virtue of Remark 1 it is sufficient to consider the space $L_2^{l}[0, T]$. The weak* compactness of the sets $\underline \partial J(\xi)$, $\overline \partial J(\xi)$ in the space $L_2^{l}[0, T]$ follows from their weak compactness (in $L_2^{l}[0, T]$) by virtue of these topologies definitions (see \cite{kolfom}). The space $L_2^{l}[0, T]$ is reflexive (\cite{DunfordSchwarz}), so the set there is weakly compact if and only if it is bounded in norm and weakly closed (\cite{DunfordSchwarz}) in this space. These required properties have been proved in the previous two paragraphs. 

The theorem is proved. 
\end{proof}

Thus, as one can see from Theorem 5.2, the quasidifferentials of the functionals $I_1(x, z, u)$ and $I_3(u)$ are completely defined by the quasidifferentials of their integrands (at each time moment $t \in [0, T]$). The Appendix contains the detailed description of calculating the quasidifferentials required as well as the main quasidifferential rules.  

We have the following final formula for calculating the quasidifferential of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ at the point $(x, z, u)$
\begin{equation}
\label{16'}
\mathcal{D} \, I(x, z, u) = \big[ \underline \partial I(x, z, u), \, \overline \partial I(x, z, u) \big] = \left[ \sum_{k=1}^4 \underline \partial I_k(x, z, u), \ \sum_{k=1}^4 \overline \partial I_k(x, z, u) \right]
\end{equation} 
where formally $I_2(x, z, u) := I_2(z)$, $I_3(x, z, u) := I_3(u)$, $I_4(x, z, u) := I_4(x, z)$.

\begin{remark}
The assumption of the absolute uniform quasidifferentiability has been made in order to simplify the presentation. Via a special form of the mean value theorem (\cite{DolgConverg}, Pr. 2) for quasidifferentials one can show that this assumption is actually redundant.  
\end{remark}

Using the known minimum condition (of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ at the point $(x^*, z^{*}, u^{*})$ in this case) in terms of quasidifferential, we conclude that the following theorem is true.

\begin{theorem} {(\cite{dolgopolik1}, Th. 1)}

Let Assumptions 1, 2 be satisfied. In order for the control $u^{*} \in U$ to bring system (\ref{1}) from initial point (\ref{2}) to final state (\ref{5}) in the time $T$, it is necessary to have 
\begin{equation}
\label{17}
- \overline \partial I (x^*, z^{*}, u^{*}) \subset \underline \partial I (x^*, z^{*}, u^{*})
\end{equation}
at each $t \in [0, T]$ where the expressions for the subdifferential $\underline \partial I (x, z, u)$ and for the superdifferential $\overline \partial I (x, z, u)$ are given by formula (\ref{16'}). If one has $I(x^*, z^{*}, u^{*}) = 0$, then condition (\ref{17}) is also sufficient.
\end{theorem}

Theorem 5.3 already contains a constructive minimum condition since on its basis it is possible to construct the quasidifferential descent method; and for solving each of the subproblems arising during realization of this method (for a wide class of functions) there are known efficient algorithms for solving them. 


\section{The Quasidifferential Descent Method}

Let us describe the following quasidifferentiable descent method for finding stationary points of the functional $I(x, z, u)$. 

Fix an arbitrary initial point $(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}, u_{(1)}) \in C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$. Let the point $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) \in C_n[0, T] \times P_n[0, T] \times P_m[0, T]$ be already constructed. If for each $t \in [0, T]$ minimum condition (\ref{17}) is satisfied (in practice, with some fixed accuracy $\overline{\varepsilon}$), then $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ is a stationary point of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ and the process terminates. Otherwise, put
$$
(x_{(k+1)}, z_{(k+1)}, u_{(k+1)}) = (x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) + \gamma_{(k)} G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})
$$
where the vector-function $G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ is the quasidifferential descent direction of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ at the point $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ and the value $\gamma_{(k)}$ is a solution of the following one-dimensional problem
\begin{equation}
\label{18}
\min_{\gamma \geqslant 0} I \Big( (x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) + \gamma G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) \Big) = I \Big( (x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) + \gamma_{(k)} G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})\Big). 
\end{equation}
Then $I (x_{(k+1)}, z_{(k+1)}, u_{(k+1)}) \leqslant I (x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) $. 
%If the sequence $ (x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) $ is finite then its last point , то последняя ее точка является стационарной точкой функционала $I(x, z, u)$ по построению. Если же последовательность $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ бесконечна, то описанный процесс может и не привести к стационарной точке функционала $I(x, z, u)$, поскольку квазидифференциальное отображение $\mathcal{D} I(x, z, u)$ не является непрерывным в метрике Хаусдорфа \cite{demrub}.

As seen from the algorithm described, in order to realize the $k$-th iteration, one has to solve three subproblems. The first subproblem is to calculate the quasidifferential of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ at the point $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$. With the help of quasidifferential calculus rules the solution of this subproblem is obtained in formula (\ref{16'}). The second subproblem is to find the quasidifferential descent direction $G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$; the following two paragraphs are devoted to solving this subproblem. Finally, the third subproblem is one-dimensional minimization (\ref{18}); there are many effective methods  (\cite{Vasil'ev}) for solving this subproblem. 

In order to obtain the vector-function $G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$, consider the problem
\begin{equation}
\label{19}
\max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt. 
\end{equation}
Denote $\overline{v}(t)$, $\overline{w}(t)$ its solution. (The vector-functions $\overline{v}(t)$, $\overline{w}(t)$, of course, depend on the point $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ but we omit this dependence in the notation for brevity.) Then the vector-function $G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) = -\big( \overline{v}(t) + \overline{w}(t) \big)$ is a quasidifferential descent direction of the functional $I(x, z, u)$ at the point $(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$. Note that the functional $I(x, z, u)$ quasidifferential at each time moment $t \in [0, T]$ is calculated independently (i. e. the functional $I(x, z, u)$ quasidifferential, calculated at one time moment, does not depend on the functional $I(x, z, u)$ quasidifferential, calculated at some other time moment).

Now let us check that in order to solve problem (\ref{19}) in this case, one has to solve the problem 
\begin{equation}
\label{20}
\max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2
\end{equation}
 for each $t \in [0, T]$.
 
 Indeed, let $\overline v$, $\overline w \in C_n[0,T] \times P_n[0,T] \times P_m[0, T]$ be such that for each $t \in [0, T]$ we have 
 $$\big( \overline v(t) + \overline w(t) \big )^2 = \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2.$$
 Then we obtain
 $$\int_0^T \big( \overline v(t) + \overline w(t) \big )^2 dt = \int_0^T \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt = $$
 $$ = \int_0^T \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + \overline w(t) \big )^2 dt = \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + \overline w(t) \big )^2 dt $$
 where the last equality holds due to Filippov lemma (cf. formula (\ref{15})). Hence the following inequality holds true: 
 $$ \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt \geq $$
 \begin{equation} \label{ineq1}
  \geq \int_0^T \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt .
  \end{equation}
  
 Now fix some $\overline{\overline w} \in C_n[0,T] \times P_n[0,T] \times P_m[0, T]$. Again, by Filippov lemma we get
  $$ \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + \overline{\overline w}(t) \big )^2 dt = \int_0^T \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + \overline{\overline w}(t) \big )^2 dt \leq $$ 
  $$ \leq \int_0^T \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt. $$
  Since the vector function $\overline{\overline w}(t)$ was chosen arbitrarily, we obtain the inequality
$$ \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt \leq $$
 \begin{equation} \label{ineq2}
  \leq \int_0^T \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt. 
  \end{equation}
 
 From inequalities (\ref{ineq1}) and (\ref{ineq2}) we finally get the equality
 $$ \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \int_0^T \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt = $$
 \begin{equation} \label{eq}
  = \int_0^T \max_{w \in \overline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \min_{v \in \underline{\partial} I(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}) } \big( v(t) + w(t) \big )^2 dt. 
  \end{equation}
  
  The equality (\ref{eq}) justifies that in order to solve problem (\ref{19}) it is sufficient to solve problem (\ref{20}) for each time moment $t \in [0, T]$. Once again we emphasize that this statement holds true due to the special structure of the quasidifferential which in turn takes place due to the separation implemented of the vector functions \linebreak $x(t)$ and $\dot x(t)$ into ``independent'' variables.

Problem (\ref{20}) at each fixed $t \in [0, T]$ is a finite-dimensional problem of finding the Hausdorff deviation of one convex compact set (a minus superdifferential) from another convex compact set (a subdifferential). This problem may be effectively solved for a rich class of functions; its solution is described in the next paragraph. In practice, one makes a (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$ and this problem is being solved for each point of the partition, i. e. one calculates $G(t_i,(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)}))$ where \linebreak $t_i \in [0, T]$, $i = \overline{1, N}$, are discretization points (see notation of Lemmas 6.1, 6.2 below). Under additional natural assumption Lemma 6.1 below guarantees that the vector-function obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation of the quasidifferential descent directions calculated at each point of such a partition of the interval $[0, T]$ converges in the space $L_2^{2n + m}[0, T]$ (as the discretization rank $N$ tends to infinity) to the vector-function $G(x_{(k)}, z_{(k)}, u_{(k)})$ sought. 

As noted in the previous paragraph, during the algorithm realization it is required to find the Hausdorff deviation of the minus superdifferential from the subdifferential of the functional $I (x(t), z(t), u(t))$ at each time moment of a (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$. In this paragraph we describe in detail a solution (for a rich class of functions) of this subproblem for some fixed value $t \in [0, T]$. It is known (\cite{demrub}) that in many practical cases the subdifferential $\underline \partial I (x(t), z(t), u(t))$ is a convex polyhedron $A(t) \subset R^{2n+m}$ and analogously the superdifferential $\overline \partial I (x(t), z(t), u(t))$ is a convex polyhedron $B(t) \subset R^{2n + m}$. For example, if some function is a superposition of the finite number of maxima and minima of continuously differentiable functions, then its subdifferential and its superdifferential are convex polyhedra. Herewith, of course, the sets $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ depend on the point $(x, z, u)$. For simplicity, we omit this dependence in this paragraph notation. Find the Hausdorff deviation of the set $-B(t)$ from the set $A(t)$. It is clear that in this case it is sufficient to go over all the vertices $b_j(t)$, $j = \overline{1,s}$ (here $s$ is a number of vertices of the polyhedron $-B(t)$): find the Euclidean distance from every of these vertices to the polyhedron $A(t)$ and then among all the distances obtained choose the largest one. Let the Euclidean distance sought, corresponding to the vertex $b_j(t)$, $j = \overline{1,s}$, is achieved at the point $a_j(t) \in A(t)$ (which is the only one since $A(t)$ is a convex compact). Then the deviation sought is the value $||b_{\overline j}(t) - a_{\overline{j}}(t)||_{R^{2n + m}}$, $\overline j \in \{1, \dots, s\}$. (Herewith, this deviation may be achieved at several vertices of the polyhedron $-B(t)$; in this case $b_{\overline j}(t)$ denotes any of them.)
%and the vector $\displaystyle {g(t) = -\frac{b_{\overline j}(t) - a(t)}{||b(t)_{\overline j} - a(t)||_{R^{2n+m}}}}$ (which, of course, also depends on the point $(x, z, u)$) is (as shown in the previous paragraph) is the quasidifferential descent direction of the functional $I (x(t), z(t), u(t))$ at the point $t \in [0, T]$. 
Note that the arising here problem of finding the Euclidean distance from a point to a convex polyhedron can be effectively solved by various methods (see, e. g. \cite{demvas}, \cite{wolfe}).

In Lemmas 6.1, 6.2 we will write $L_2 [0,T]$ and $L_\infty [0,T]$ instead of $L_2^1 [0,T]$ and $L_\infty^1 [0,T]$ respectively for the convenience of notation.

First, give a lemma with a rather simple condition which, on the one hand, is quite natural for applications and, on the other hand, guarantees that the function $L(t)$ obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation of the sought function $p \in L_{\infty}[0, T]$ converges to this function in the space $L_2[0, T]$. 

\begin{lemma}
 Let the function $p \in L_{\infty}[0, T]$ satisfy the following condition: for every $\overline{\delta} > 0$ the function $p(t)$ is piecewise continuous on the set $[0, T]$ with the exception of only the finite number of the intervals $\big(\overline t_1(\overline{\delta}), \overline t_2(\overline{\delta})\big), \dots, \big(\overline t_{r}(\overline{\delta}), \overline t_{r+1}(\overline{\delta})\big)$ whose union length does not exceed the number $\overline{\delta}$. 
 
 Choose a (uniform) finite splitting $t_1 = 0, t_2, \dots, t_{N-1}, t_N = T$ of the interval $[0, T]$ and calculate the values $p(t_i)$, $i = \overline{1, N}$, at these points. Let $L(t)$ be the function obtained with the help of piecewise linear interpolation with the nodes $(t_i, p(t_i))$, \linebreak $i = \overline{1, N}$. Then for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists such a number $\overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ that for every $N > \overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ one has $||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,T]} \leqslant \varepsilon$.
 \end{lemma}  

 \begin{proof} Denote $M(\overline{\delta}) := \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{r} \big(\overline t_{k}(\overline{\delta}), \overline t_{k+1}(\overline{\delta})\big)$. We have 
  $$||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,T]} = \int_{M(\overline{\delta})} \big (L(t) - p(t) \big)^2 dt + \int_{[0, T] \setminus M(\overline{\delta})} \big (L(t) - p(t) \big)^2 dt.$$
   Fix the arbitrary number $\varepsilon > 0$. By lemma condition the function $p(t)$ is bounded, the function $L(t)$ is also bounded by construction for all (uniform) finite partitions of the interval $[0, T]$. Hence, there exists such $\overline\delta(\varepsilon)$ that the first summand does not exceed the value ${\varepsilon}/{2}$ for all (uniform) finite partitions
of the interval $[0, T]$. As assumed, the function $p(t)$ is piecewise continuous and bounded on the set $[0, T] \setminus M(\overline{\delta}(\varepsilon))$, then there exists (\cite{ryab}) such a number $\overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ that for every (uniform) finite partition of the interval $[0, T]$ of the rank $N > \overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ the second summand (with such~$\overline{\delta}(\varepsilon))$ does not exceed the value ${\varepsilon}/{2}$. 
This implies the proof of the lemma.    
\end{proof} 
   
   Now give a lemma with a more general but less clear (compared to the previous lemma) condition which also guarantees that the function $L(t)$ obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation of the sought function $p \in L_{\infty}[0, T]$ converges to this function in the space $L_2[0, T]$.
   
\begin{lemma}
 Let the function $p \in L_{\infty}[0, T]$ satisfy the following conditions: 
 1) for every $\overline{\varepsilon} > 0$ there exists such a closed set $T(\overline{\varepsilon}) \subset [0, T]$ that the function $p(t) |_{T(\overline{\varepsilon})}$ is continuous and $|T'(\overline{\varepsilon})| < \overline{\varepsilon}$ where $T'(\overline{\varepsilon}) := [0, T] \setminus T(\overline{\varepsilon})$; 
 2) for every $\delta > 0$ there exists such a number $\overline{\overline{N}}(\delta)$ that for each $N > \overline{\overline{N}}(\delta)$ we have $|M(\delta)| < \delta$ where \linebreak $M(\delta) := \bigcup\limits_{k=2}^{N} [t_{k-1}, t_{k}]$; here we take the union of only such intervals $[t_{k-1}, t_{k}]$, \linebreak $k \in \{2, \dots, N\}$, in each of which at least one of the points $t_{k-1}$, $t_{k}$, $k \in \{2, \dots, N\}$, belongs to the set $T'(\overline{\varepsilon})$.
 
  Choose a (uniform) finite splitting $t_1 = 0, t_2, \dots, t_{N-1}, t_N = T$ of the interval $[0, T]$ and calculate the values $p(t_i)$, $i = \overline{1, N}$, at these points. Let $L(t)$ be the function obtained with the help of piecewise linear interpolation with the nodes $(t_i, p(t_i))$, \linebreak $i = \overline{1, N}$. Then for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists such a number $\overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ that for every $N > \overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ one has $||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,T]} < \varepsilon$. 
  \end{lemma}
  
\begin{proof} Note that the first assumption of the lemma is always satisfied since it is nothing but formulation of Lusin's theorem (\cite{kolfom}). However, it is given in the lemma formulation since the set $T'(\varepsilon)$ introduced there is used in the second assumption of the lemma.
  
  Fix some number $\varepsilon > 0$. 
  
  Let $q(t)$ be a ``polygonal extension'' of the function $p(t) |_{T(\overline{\varepsilon})}$ onto the whole interval $[0, T]$ which may be constructed (\cite{Cullum1969}, Lemma 4.1) due to the fact that the set $T(\overline{\varepsilon})$ is closed (see assumption 1) of the lemma). Then the function $q(t)$ is continuous on $[0, T]$ and $q(t) = p(t)$ at $t \in T(\overline{\varepsilon})$. Herewith, one can check (see \cite{Cullum1969}, Lemma 4.1) that one may choose $\overline{\varepsilon}$ in such a way that  
  \begin{equation}
\label{22}
\displaystyle{\int_0^T (q(t) - p(t))^2 dt < \varepsilon/3}.
\end{equation} 
  
  Consider the expression \begin{equation}
\label{21} \displaystyle{\int_0^T \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt} = \int_{M(\delta)} \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt + \int_{[0, T] \setminus M(\delta)} \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt. \end{equation}  
 
 Consider the first summand in the right-hand side of equality (\ref{21}). By construction the function $q(t)$ is bounded, the function $L(t)$ is also bounded by construction for all (uniform) finite partitions of the interval $[0, T]$. Then from assumption 2) of the lemma it follows that for $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists such $\delta(\varepsilon)$ that for every (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$ of the rank $N > \overline{\overline{N}}(\delta(\varepsilon))$ one has
   \begin{equation}
\label{23} \int_{M(\delta)} \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt < \varepsilon/3.
\end{equation} 

Consider the second summand in the right-hand side of equality (\ref{21}). Let $\overline L(t)$ be a function obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation with the nodes $(t_i, q(t_i))$, \linebreak $i = \overline{1, N}$. Insofar as the function $q(t)$ is continuous on  $[0, T]$, then there exists (\cite{ryab}) such a number $\overline{\overline{\overline{N}}}(\varepsilon)$ that for every (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$ of the rank $N > \overline{\overline{\overline{N}}}(\varepsilon)$ one has $\displaystyle{\int_0^T \big (\overline L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt < \varepsilon / 3}$. But at $t \in [0, T] \setminus M(\delta)$ we have $L(t) = \overline L(t)$ by construction (with the same rank of partitions involved in these functions construction), insofar as if $t_i \in [0, T] \setminus M(\delta)$, $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$, then $t_i \in T(\varepsilon)$, and for such $t_i$ we have $q(t_i) = p(t_i)$. For every (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$ of the rank $N > \overline{\overline{\overline{N}}}(\varepsilon)$ we then have
  \begin{equation}
\label{24} \int_{[0, T] \setminus M(\delta)} \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt = \int_{[0, T] \setminus M(\delta)} \big (\overline L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt \leqslant \int_0^T \big (\overline L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt < \varepsilon / 3. 
\end{equation} 
  
  Take $\overline{N}(\varepsilon) = \max\Big\{\overline{\overline{N}}(\delta(\varepsilon)), \overline{\overline{\overline{N}}}(\varepsilon)\Big\}$. For every (uniform) partition of the interval $[0, T]$ of the rank $N > \overline{N}(\varepsilon)$ from  (\ref{22}), (\ref{23}), (\ref{24}) we finally have
    $$||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,T]} \leqslant \int_{0}^T \big (L(t) - q(t) \big)^2 dt + \int_{0}^T \big (q(t) - p(t) \big)^2 dt < \varepsilon / 3 + \varepsilon / 3 + \varepsilon / 3 = \varepsilon.$$
    The lemma is proved.
\end{proof}

 \begin{remark} 
 The meaning of assumption~2) of Lemma~6.2 is the requirement that $p(t)$ does not have ``too many'' discontinuity points on the segment $[0, T]$. It may be directly verified that if the condition of Lemma 6.1 on the function $p(t)$ is fulfilled, then the condition required is satisfied. In the picture a simple example is given of a measurable bounded function with an infinite number of discontinuity points for which one may construct the function $q(t)$ in such a way that the set $M(\delta)$ measure is arbitrarily small for a sufficiently large splitting rank. It is an example of an ``appropriate'' in the sense of Lemma~6.2 assumption function. 
 \end{remark}
   % give an example of those ones for which this condition is satisfied.

  
   
  %\caption{Birds}


Let us give an example of the function for which this condition is violated. Let $p(t)$ be the Dirichlet function on the segment $[0, 1]$, i. e. taking the value $1$ at rational points and taking the value $0$ at irrational points of this interval. If we take the function $q(t) = 0$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$ as a continuous one and as satisfying Lusin's theorem applied to the function $p(t)$, then condition 2) of Lemma 6.2 will be violated with every rank of (uniform) splitting of the interval $[0, 1]$, insofar as with such a splitting all the splitting points will be rational, i. e. will belong to the set $T'(\overline\varepsilon)$ $\forall \overline \varepsilon > 0$, hence $|M(\delta)| = 1$ $\forall \delta > 0$ in this case. It is seen that in this example one has $||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,1]} =1$ for each function $L(t)$ obtained via piecewise-linear interpolation of the function $p(t)$ with a uniform splitting of the segment $[0, 1]$, insofar as with such a splitting we always have $L(t) = 1$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$. The Dirichlet function $p(t)$ does not satisfy condition 2) of Lemma~6.2, insofar as this function has ``too many'' discontinuity points on the interval $[0, 1]$.
  
%Смысл условия 2) Леммы 2 состоит в требованиии, чтобы у функции $p(t)$ было <<не слишком много>> точек разрыва на множестве $[0, T]$. Очевидно, что при выполнении условия Леммы 1 на функцию $p(t)$ это условие выполнено. На рисунке показан пример измеримой ограниченной функции, для которой можно построить функцию $q(t)$ так, чтобы мера множества $M(\delta)$ была сколь угодно малой при достаточно большом ранге разбиения. Тем самым это условие для таких функций выполняется. Приведём пример функции, для которой это условие нарушается. Пусть $p(t)$ --- функция Дирихле на отрезке $[0, 1]$, то есть принимающая значение 1 в рациональных точках и значение 0 в иррациональных точках этого промежутка. Если взять функцию $q(t) = 0$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$ как непрерывную функцию, удовлетворяющую теореме Лузина для функции $p(t)$, то условие 2) Леммы 2 будет нарушено при любом ранге равномерного разбиения отрезка $[0, 1]$, поскольку при таком разбиении все точки разбиения будут рациональными, то есть будут принадлежать множеству $T'(\overline\varepsilon)$ $\forall \overline \varepsilon > 0$, поэтому $|M(\delta)| = 1$ $\forall \delta > 0$ в данном случае. Видно, что в этом примере $||L - p||^2_{L_2[0,1]} =1$ для любой функции $L(t)$, полученной кусочно-линейной интерполяцией функции $p(t)$ при равномерном разбиении отрезка $[0, 1]$, поскольку при таком разбиении всегда имеем $L(t) = 1$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$. 

%\textbf{Замечание 3.}
%В силу отмеченного факта разрывности квазидифференциального отображения в метрике Хаусдорфа и как следствие невозможности гарантировать сходимость описанного метода квазидифференциального спуска нужно использовать взамен кодифференциал и метод кодифференциального спуска соответственно, сходимость которого можно  гарантировать при некоторых естественных дополнительных предположениях. Отметим, что множество квазидифференцируемых функций совпадает с множеством кодифференцируемых функций, и правила кодифференциального исчисления аналогичны правилам квазидифференциального исчисления \cite{demrub}. Однако на практике рекомендуется использовать метод квазидифференциального спуска, поскольку он менее затратный с вычислительной точки зрения, чем метод кодифференциального спуска, и <<как правило>> приводит к стационарной точке минимизирумого функционала. Дать строгую расшифровку слов <<как правило>> достаточно затруднительно, однако чтобы интуитивно осознать специфичность случаев, когда метод квазидифференциально спуска не работает должным образом, можно обратиться к специально построенному в конечномерном случае примеру \cite{demvas}, в котором метод зацикливается.  

\begin{remark}
The problem of a rigorous proof of the above method convergence
is rather complicated and remains open; it is beyond the scope of
this paper. The convergence of some modifications of the
subdifferential descent method, as a special case of the quasidifferntial descent method described, was studied in the finite-dimensional case in papers \cite{demvas}, \cite{demmal}. It is an interesting problem for future investigations to attempt to spread the ideas of these studies to explore convergence in the more general problem considered in this paper (the case of a quasidifferentiable functional in a functional space).  Strictly speaking, in the paper presented
only the problem of finding the direction of the steepest (quasidifferential)
descent in the problem posed is completely solved. The examples below show
the adequacy of the method used; nevertheless, as just noted, its
convergence (in whatever sense) requires additional rigorous justification.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
One of the possible problems for the future research is application of the main concepts of this paper to some more difficult control problems. For example, consider the problem of minimizing the functional $$J(x, u) = \int^T_0 f_0(x(t), \dot x(t), u(t), t) dt$$
under restrictions (\ref{1}), (\ref{2}), (\ref{5}) and $u \in U$ (see (\ref{4''})). We don't give here the assumptions regarding the integrand of the functional $J(x, u)$ as in this Remark only the essence of the problem is discussed. For simplicity consider now only restriction (\ref{1}) and construct the functional
$$J(x, z, u) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^n \int_0^T \big| z_i (t) - f_i(x(t), u(t), t) \big | dt. $$
The hypothesis (based on the previous research made in \cite{dolgfom}) is that under some natural assumptions this functional is an exact penalty one. This means that there exists such a value $\lambda^* < \infty$ that $\forall \lambda > \lambda^*$ the problem of minimizing the functional constructed is equivalent to the stated problem of minimizing the functional $J(x,u)$ under restriction (\ref{1}). We omit the details here. Note only that the functional constructed may be treated via the method of the paper presented so it is interesting to try such an approach.
\end{remark}

\section{Numerical Examples} 
Let us first explain the operation of the quasidifferential descent method using an illustrative example in which the iterations are given in detail. For simplicity of presentation this example is not chosen as a control problem but is a nonsmooth problem of the calculus of variations; however, according to the minimized functional structure, it fits the formulation of the problem considered in the paper.
 
%\textbf{Пример 1.1}
%Рассмотрим минимизацию простейшего функционала 
%$$I(x) = \int_0^1 |x(t)| dt$$
%с единственным очевидным решением $x^*(t) = 0$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$. Выберем в качестве начального приближения функцию $x_{(1)}(t) = 2t - 1$ и произведём дискретизацию отрезка $[0, 1]$ с рангом разбиения, равным двум (то есть рассмотрим точки $0$, $0.5$, $1$ для дальнейшей интерполяции направления квазидифференциального спуска). Согласно алгоритму, вычислим направления спуска отдельно в этих точках. Тогда в точке $0$ функция $|x_{(1)}(t)|$ дифференцируема поэтому её квазидифференциал имеет вид $ \mathcal{D} x_{(1)}(0) = [\{1\}, \{0\}] $, находим уклонение множества $-\overline{\partial}x_{(1)}(0) = \{0\}$ до множества $\underline{\partial}x_{(1)}(0) = \{1\}$ и получаем направление квазидифференциального спуска $G(0, x_{(1)}) = 1$. Аналогично имеем $G(1, x_{(1)}) = -1$. В точке $0.5$ функция $|x_{(1)}(t)|$ субдифференцируема поэтому её квазидифференциал имеет вид $ \mathcal{D} x_{(1)}(0) = [[-1, 1], \{0\}]$, находим уклонение множества $-\overline{\partial}x_{(1)}(0) = \{0\}$ до множества $\underline{\partial}x_{(1)}(0) = [-1, 1]$ и получаем направление квазидифференциального спуска $G(0.5, x_{(1)}) = 0$. Произведя интерполяцию с узлами $(0, 1)$, $(0.5, 0)$, $(1, -1)$, получаем направление квазидифференциально спуска функционала $I(x)$ в точке $x_{(1)}$, а именно $G( x_{(1)}) = -2t+1$. Строим следующую точку $x_{(2)}(t) = 2t-1 + \gamma (-2t+1)$ и решая задачу одномерной минимизации $\min_{\gamma \geqslant 0} \displaystyle{\int_0^1 |x_{(2)}(t)| dt}$, имеем $\gamma_{(1)} = 1$, поэтому $x_{(2)}(t) = 0 $ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$, то есть в данном случае метод квазидифференциального спуска привёл к точному решению за один шаг. Разумеется, начальное приближение и ранг дискретизации здесь подобраны искусственно с целью демонстрации сути работы метода. Если взять другие начальное приближение и ранг дискретизации, то точного решения за конечное число шагов получить уже не удастся.  
% 
%  \textbf{Пример 1.2}
%Рассмотрим минимизацию простейшего функционала 
%$$I(x) = \int_0^1 |x(t) - \max\{t-0.5, 0\}| dt $$
%с единственным очевидным решением $x^*(t) = \max\{t-0.5, 0\}$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$.

\begin{example}
Consider the functional 
$$I(x,z) = \int_0^1 |z(t) + |x(t)|| dt + \int_0^1 |z(t)| dt + \int_0^T \Big( x(t) - x_0 - \int_0^t z(\tau) d \tau \Big)^2 dt  $$
with the initial point $x_0  = 0$ and with the obvious solution $x^*(t) = 0$, $z^*(t) = 0$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$. Note that the third summand here means that $z(t)$ must be the derivative of $x(t)$ (see the functional $I_4(x, z)$ in formula (\ref{7}) and formula (\ref{6})). 

Take the functions $x_{(1)}(t) = t-0.5$, $z_{(1)}(t) = 0$ as an initial approximation and discretize the segment $[0, 1]$ with a splitting rank, equal to $2$ (i. e. consider the points $0$, $0.5$, $1$ for further interpolation of the quasidifferential descent direction). According to the algorithm, calculate the descent direction separately at these points. At the point $t=0$ we have $$\underline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \mathrm{co} \left\{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -2 \end{array} \right), \left(\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ -2 \end{array} \right) \right\},$$  $$\overline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right).$$ Find the deviation of the set $-\overline{\partial}  I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)})$ from the set $\underline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)})$ at the point $t=0$ and obtain the quasidifferential descent direction $G(0, ( x_{(1)},z_{(1)})) = (0, 2)'$. \linebreak At the point $t=0.5$ we have $$\underline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \mathrm{co} \bigg\{ \left( \begin{array}{c} -0.25 \\ -2 \end{array} \right), \left(\begin{array}{c} 1.75 \\ -2 \end{array} \right),  \left( \begin{array}{c} -0.25 \\ 2 \end{array} \right), $$ $$\left( \begin{array}{c} 1.75 \\ 2 \end{array} \right), \left( \begin{array}{c} -2.25 \\ 0 \end{array} \right), \left( \begin{array}{c} -0.25 \\ 0 \end{array} \right) \bigg\},$$  $$\overline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \mathrm{co} \left\{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -1 \end{array} \right), \left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right) \right\},$$ hence, one has $G(0.5, (x_{(1)},z_{(1)})) = (0, 0)'$. At the point $t=1$ we have $$\underline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \mathrm{co} \left\{ \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 2 \end{array} \right), \left(\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 2 \end{array} \right) \right\},$$  $$\overline{\partial} I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right),$$ so one has $G(1, (x_{(1)},z_{(1)})) = (0, -2)'$. By making the appropriate interpolation we obtain the quasidifferential descent direction of the functional $I(x,z)$ at the point $(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)})$, namely $G(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}) = (0, -4t+2)'$. Construct the next point $(x_{(2)}(t), z_{(2)}(t)) = (0 + \gamma_{(1)} \, 0, t-0.5 + \gamma_{(1)} (-4t+2))'$; having solved the one-dimensional minimization problem $\min_{\gamma \geqslant 0} I(x_{(2)}, z_{(2)})$, we have $\gamma_{(1)} = 0.25$, hence, $x_{(2)}(t) = 0 $, $z_{(2)}(t) = 0 $ for all $t \in [0, 1]$, i. e. in this case the quasidifferential descent method leads to the exact solution in one step. 

Of course, the initial approximation and discretization rank are chosen artificially here in order to demonstrate the essence of the method developed. If we take different initial approximation and discretization rank, then in a general case it will no longer be possible to obtain an exact solution in the finite number of steps. 

Consider now some examples of nonsmooth control problems. In all examples presented the iterations were carried out till the error on the right endpoint did not exceed the value $5 \times 10^{-3}$ (of the trajectories resulting from numerical integration of the system (from the initial left endpoint given) with the control substituted which was obtained via the method of the paper). Such a choice of accuracy is due to a compromise between the permissible for practice accuracy of the required value of the considered functional and a not very large number of iterations. The magnitude $||G{(x, z, u)}||$ (the norm is considered in the corresponding space) on the solution is also presented and did not exceed the value $5 \times 10^{-3}$ --- $8 \times 10^{-3}$  (see inclusion (\ref{17}) and problem (\ref{19})). 

The calculations were performed in the package Maple 12.0 Serial Number: \linebreak 2011-11-11 on a computer with the Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30 GHz and 8 GB of RAM. The choice of package is justified by the fact that symbolic computations are natural for some stages of the algorithm presented; it also made the iterations more demonstrative. On the other hand, a significant part of the computational time was spent operating with symbolic expressions.

\begin{example}
Consider the system
$$\dot x_1(t) = -|x_1(t)|,$$
$$\dot x_2(t) = u(t).$$

It is required to find such a control $u^* \in U$ which brings this system from the initial point $x(0) = (0, 0)'$ to the final state $x(1) = (0, 0)'$ at the moment $T=1$. Herewith, put $\underline u = -1$, $\overline u = 1$, i. e. we suppose that $-1 \leq u(t) \leq 1$ $\forall t \in [0, 1]$.

The problem given is reduced to an unconstrained minimization of the functional 
$$
I(x,z,u) = \int_0^1 \big| z_1 (t) + |x_1(t)| \big | dt + \int_0^1 \big| z_2 (t) - u(t) \big | dt + $$ $$ +\frac{1}{2} \Big( \int_0^1 z_1(t) dt\Big)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \Big( \int_0^1 z_2(t) dt\Big)^2 + $$
$$ +  \int_0^1 \max \{-1 - u(t), 0 \} dt + \int_0^1 \max \{{u}(t) - 1, 0 \} dt + $$ 
$$ + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \Big( x_1(t) - \int_0^t z_1(\tau) d \tau \Big)^2 dt + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \Big( x_2(t) - \int_0^t z_2(\tau) d \tau \Big)^2 dt. $$

Take $(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}, u_{(1)}) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)'$ as an initial point, then $I(x_{(1)}, z_{(1)}, u_{(1)})\approx$ $\approx 3.33333$. As the iteration number increased, the discretization rank gradually increased during the solution
of the auxiliary problem of finding the direction of the quasidifferential descent described in the algorithm and, in the end, the discretization step was equal to $10^{-1}$. At the $17$-th iteration the control $u_{(17)}$ was constructed:

As a result, we have the corresponding trajectory (which is an approximation to the one $x^*$ sought) with the values $x_1(T) = 0$, $x_2(T) = 0.00585$, so we see that the error does not exceed the value $5 \times 10^{-3}$. Herewith, $||G(x, z, u)||_{L^2_2[0,T] \times L^2_2[0,T] \times L^1_2[0,T]} =  0.00585$.

\begin{example}
It is required to bring the system
$$\dot x_1(t) = x_2(t) x_3(t) + u_1(t),$$
$$\dot x_2(t) = x_1(t) x_3(t) + u_2(t),$$
$$\dot x_3(t) = x_1(t) x_2(t) + u_3(t)$$
 from the initial point $x(0) = (1, 0, 0)'$ to the final state $x(1) = (0, 0, 0)'$ at the moment $T = 1$. Herewith, we suppose that the total control consumption is subject to the constraint
 $$ \int_0^1 |u_1(t)| + |u_2(t)| + |u_3(t)| dt = 1.$$
 This problem has a practical application to the optimal satellite stabilization and was considered in work \cite{krylov}.

\begin{example}
Consider the system
$$\dot x_1(t) = x_2(t)$$
$$\dot x_2(t) = u(t) - P x_2(t) |x_2(t)| - Q x_2(t).$$

It is required to find such a control $u^* \in U$ which brings this system from the initial point $x(0) = (0, 0)'$ to the final state $x(48) = (200, 0)'$ at the moment $T=48$. Herewith, put $\underline u = -2/3$, $\overline u = 2/3$, i. e. we suppose that $-2/3 \leq u(t) \leq 2/3$ \, $\forall t \in [0, 48]$. The parameters of the problem are $P = 0.78 \times 10^{-4}$ and $Q = 0.28 \times 10^{-3}$. This problem has a practical application to the optimal train motion and was considered in work \cite{outrata}. Not that the right-hand side of the system contains a nondifferentiable term. On the other hand, essential assumption of the paper is that only continuous differentiable functions in the right-hand side of the system are allowed (see \cite{outrata}, Par. 2,  Assumption. (ii)). So the paper \cite{outrata} method presumably can not be implemented on those iterations when the nondifferentiability in the system right-hand side occurs (as for example, on the first iteration in our case since the initial approximation point $z_{(1)} = (0, 0, 0)'$ is taken (see the next paragraph)). (However, the paper \cite{outrata} method eventually succeeded in this example, since $x_2^*(t) > 0$ for all $t \in (0, 48)$.) 
\bigskip
\bigskip

In fact, in paper \cite{outrata} a more complicated (if we ``ignore'' the fact that the right-hand side of the system is formally nondifferentiable) problem is considered with some phase constraints and the functional
$$\int_0^{48} x_2(t) \max\{u(t), 0  \} dt$$
to be minimized. The paper gives neither the optimal control nor the resulting cost value obtained; the rough estimate of the ``characteristic'' segments (where $u(t) > 0$) given in Fig. 1, Par. 5.1 of \cite{outrata} (we duplicate this picture as well) shows that the functional optimal value exceeds the magnitude $13.3$.    

     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{outrata}

We consider a simplified problem; however, let us try to obtain this value of the functional via the new variable $x_3(t) = \displaystyle{\int_0^t  x_2(\tau) \max\{u(\tau), 0  \} d\tau}$ and explore the system with the additional equation
$$\dot x_3(t) = x_2(t) \max\{u(t), 0  \}$$
and with the boundary conditions $x(0) = (0, 0, 0)'$ and $x(48) = (200, 0, 13.3)'$ (and without any phase constraints). 

The problem given is reduced to an unconstrained minimization of the functional 
$$
I(z,u) = \int_0^{48} \big| z_2 (t) - u(t) + P z_1(t) |z_1(t)| + Q z_1(t) \big | dt + \int_0^{48} \big| z_3 (t) - z_1(t) \max\{u(t), 0  \}  \big | dt$$
$$ + \frac{1}{2} \Big( \int_0^{48} z_1(t) dt - 200\Big)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \Big( \int_0^{48} z_2(t) dt\Big)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \Big( \int_0^{48} z_3(t) dt - 13.3\Big)^2$$
$$ +  \int_0^{48} \max \{-2/3 - u(t), 0 \} dt + \int_0^{48} \max \{{u}(t) - 2/3, 0 \} dt + $$ 
$$ + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{48} \Big( z_1(t) - \int_0^t z_2(\tau) d \tau \Big)^2 dt. $$

The functional is slightly simplified beforehand using the fact that $x_2(t) = z_1(t)$, also put $\displaystyle{x_1(t) = \int_0^t z_1(\tau) d \tau}$, $\displaystyle{x_3(t) = \int_0^t z_3(\tau) d\tau }$, $t \in [0, 48]$, throughout iterations.

Take $(z_{(1)}, u_{(1)}) = (0, 0, 0, 0)'$ as an initial point, then $I(z_{(1)}, u_{(1)}) = 2 \times 10^4$. As the iteration number increased, the discretization rank gradually increased during the solution
of the auxiliary problem of finding the direction of the quasidifferential descent described in the algorithm and, in the end, the discretization step was equal to $2 \times 10^{-1}$ on the intervals $[0, 9]$ and $[40, 48]$ and equal to $3.875$ on the interval $[9, 40]$ (it was reasonable to use a nonuniform (and such a rough in the middle interval) splitting here due to the qualitative different ``behavior'' of the trajectories on these intervals). At the $216$-th iteration the control  $u_{(216)}$ was constructed:

For the convenience of presentation, the Lagrange interpolation polynomial has been given which quite accurately approximates (that is, the interpolation error does not affect the value of the functional and the boundary values) the resulting control. 

Note that during the method implementation the control was obtained bringing the trajectory from an initial position given to the final point satisfying the right endpoint constraint with the satisfactory accuracy (and delivering a rather small value to the functional minimized as well); however, this control itself violated its own restrictions by the value $2 \times 10^{-2}$ --- $4\times 10^{-2}$ at the beginning and the end of the time interval (see the control dynamics in the picture). Since the exact satisfaction of the restrictions on control is important for applications, on several last iterations it was decided to improve the accuracy via multiplying the $6$-th and the $7$-th summands of the functional by a large factor (of order $10^2$) and minimizing this modified functional during the last iterations. 
%and the Hausdorff deviation of the minus superdifferential from the subdifferential presented with a given accuracy) 

Take $u_{(216)}$ as an approximation to the control $u^*$ sought. In order to verify the result obtained and to find the ``true'' trajectory, we substitute this control into the system given and integrate it via one of the known numerical methods (here, the Runge-Kutta 4-5-th order method was used). As a result, we have the corresponding trajectory (which is an approximation to the one $x^*$ sought) with the values $x_1(T) \approx 200.00214$, $x_2(T) \approx 0.00297$, $x_3(T) \approx 13.3054$, so we see that the error does not exceed the value $5 \times 10^{-3}$. Herewith, $||G(z, u)||_{L^3_2[0,T] \times L^1_2[0,T]} =  0.00299$.

The computational time was 102 min 43 sec. The pictures illustrate the control and trajectories dynamics during the algorithm realization. For convenience also the resulting control and trajectories are depicted.

\section{Discussion}
As already noted, the main advantage of the method proposed is of theoretical nature: it is original as it is qualitatively different from existing methods based on the direct discretization of the initial problem. Besides, the method preserves attractive geometrical interpretation of quasidifferentials (see Example 7.1 and Ch.~V, Par. 3 in book \cite{demrub} for more examples with geometrical illustration in the finite-dimensional case). 

It also has some practical advantages. The following four paragraphs give examples of some specific problems demonstrating these advantages. In order to simplify the presentation and just to get essence we give examples of some problems of calculus of variations and an example of one simplest control problem only in a smooth case.

Consider the problem of minimizing the functional
$$J(x, z) = \int_0^1 z^4(t)/48 + z^2(t) + x^2(t) - 6x(t) \, dt$$
under the constraints
$$x(0) = 1, \quad x(1) = 0, \quad \int_0^1 x(t) \, dt = 2/3.$$ 
In this example the steepest descent method appeared to be very effective. On the contrary: in order to construct approximations by the Ritz-Galerkin method, a lot of calculations are required and it is also necessary to solve essentially non-linear systems with parameters. 

In a problem of minimizing the 
the functional
$$J(z) = \int_0^{10} z^2(t)- x^2(t) \, dt$$
under the constraints
$$x(0) = 0, \quad x(10) = 0$$ 
both the Euler equation and the Ritz-Galerkin method give a trajectory delivering neither a strong nor a weak minimum. The steepest descent method ``points'' to the fact that there is no solution in this problem: the one-dimensional minimization problem has no bounded solution. 

Minimize the functional
$$J(z) = \int_0^2 z^3(t) \, dt$$
under the constraints
$$x(0) = 0, \quad x(2) = 4.$$ 
This example illustrates that the steepest descent method ``points'' to the fact that, on a solution obtained, the functional reaches a weak minimum rather than a strong one, while both the Euler equation and the Ritz-Galerkin method give only a trajectory delivering a weak minimum.

All the details have been omitted for brevity. One can find a detailed description of these problems and more interesting examples as well as justification of the statements posed in the original papers \cite{demtam}, \cite{tamimm}. Note also that a method used in these papers is slightly different from the one presented but it preserves its many properties, so the comparative analysis is correct. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth} \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{initial_control}
  \end{center} 
  \end{wrapfigure}

Consider the system
$$\dot x(t) = -x(t) + u(t)$$
on the time interval $[0, 2]$. It is required to find a control $u^* \in P_1[0,T]$ such that the corresponding trajectory satisfies the boundary conditions
$$x(0) = x(2) = 0.$$

Apply direct discretization to this system via the formula
$$x(i+1) - x(i) = \frac{1}{N} (-x(i) + u(i))$$
where $i = \overline{0,19}$ and the discretization rank $N=20$.
If we use the initial condition $x_0 = x(0) = 0$ and calculate $x_{20} = x(2)$ as an explicit function of the variables $u_i$, $i = \overline{0,19}$, we will obtain \small $$x_{20}(u) \approx 0.01886768013 \, u_0 + 0.01986071592 \, u_1 + 0.02090601676 \, u_2 + \, 0.0220063334 \, u_3 +$$ $$+0.02316456151 \, u_4 + 0.02438374896 \, u_5 + 0.02566710416 \, u_6 + 0.02701800438 \, u_7 + $$
$$+ 0.02844000461 \, u_8 + 0.02993684696 \, u_9 + 0.03151247049 \, u_{10} + 0.03317102156 \, u_{11} +$$ $$+ 0.03491686480 \, u_{12} + 0.03675459453 \, u_{13} + 0.03868904688 \, u_{14} + 0.04072531250 \, u_{15} +$$ $$+ 0.04286875000 \, u_{16} + 0.045125 \, u_{17} + 0.0475 \, u_{18} + 0.05 \, u_{19}.$$ 
\normalsize So in order to get the required finite position, one has to solve the equation $x_{20}(u) = 0$ with respect to the variables $u_i$, $i = \overline{0,19}$. In other words, it is required to minimize the functional $|x_{20}(u)|$. Take the initial point $u_{(0)}$ with the following coordinates: $u_{2i}=10$, $i=\overline{0,9}$, $u_{2i+1}=-10$, $i=\overline{0,8}$, $u_{19} \approx -6.7101842175$ (see the picture). Note that $x_{20}(u_{(0)}) = 0$, so the point $u_{(0)}$ delivers a global minimum to the functional $|x_{20}(u)|$ (i.~e. the point $u_{(0)}$ solves the discretized problem). However, if we substitute this control $u_{(0)}$ into the original system, we will get the corresponding trajectory $x_{(0)}(t)$ with the finite value $x(2) \approx -0.1189349683$.

Now try to solve this problem via the method of the paper, i. e. minimize the functional
$$I(x,z,u) = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^2 \left(z(t)+x(t)-u(t)\right)^2 dt + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^2 \left( x(t) - \int_0^t z(\tau) d\tau \right)^2 dt + \frac{1}{2} \left(\int_0^2 z(t) dt \right)^2$$
(for simplicity of presentation we have taken a square-function instead of the abs-function as the integrand in the first summand). Take the same point $(x_{(0)}, z_{(0)}, u_{(0)})'$ (where $z_{(0)} = \dot x_{(0)}$) as an initial approximation. One can check that on the first iteration we will get such a control that the corresponding trajectory takes the finite value $|x(2)| < 0.11894$ (i. e. ``better'' than that one obtained via discretization method). 

In fact, applying the method to this example one can get a solution with any given accuracy. This is due the fact that the Gateaux gradient in this case is as follows:
 $$\nabla I(x, z, u, t) = \begin{pmatrix}
\big(z(t)+x(t)-u(t)\big) +\displaystyle{ \left(x(t) - \int_0^t z(\tau) d \tau \right)} \\
\big(z(t)+x(t)-u(t)\big) - \displaystyle{\left(\int_t^2 \Big( x(\tau) - \int_0^\tau z(s) ds \Big) d\tau \right)} + \int_0^2 z(t) \, dt \\
-\big(z(t)+x(t)-u(t)\big)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$   
Hence, the stopping criteria (that is $||\nabla I(x^*, z^*, u^*)||_{L_2^1[0,2] \times L_2^1[0,2] \times L_2^1[0,2]}  = 0$ in this case) may be only fulfilled (with some accuracy) when the third component of the gradient vanishes. This fact implies that the second summand in the first component vanishes. This fact finally implies that the third summand in the second component vanishes. Thus, we see that there are no local minima of the functional considered, so the method of the paper will lead to the desired solution (with any given accuracy). Roughly speaking, the method proposed ``analyzes'' the ``behavior'' of the whole trajectory, rather than only its points considered at some discrete moments of time.   

Although in this example the initial control is chosen in a special way, one can easily check that there is a ``huge'' number of other controls with the same properties (i. e. delivering a global minimum to the functional $|x_T(u)|$ but giving an error to the right endpoint value). Both increasing the time moment $T$ and adding some kind of nonsmoothness in the right-hand side of the system given (for example taking the function $-|x(t)|$ instead of $-x(t)$ now) will only increase this ``huge'' number. Of course, while increasing discretization rank, one can decrease the error on the right endpoint. On the other hand, even the discretization rank taken seems to be not very high for control problems solved via discretization or a ``control parametrization'' technique (see, e. g. \cite{teogoh}). Besides, for any discretization rank taken the initial control may be chosen in such a way that it will deliver the global minimum to the functional minimized (i. e. $x_T(u_{(0)}) = 0$) but give an arbitrary large error to the right endpoint value.  

As noted, only the smooth case in the examples given is considered for simplicity. A nonsmooth case may lead to even more difficulties: for example, in the control problem presented any kind of nondifferentiability in the right-hand side will significantly increase the number of ``local'' minima with direct discretization used. 

List also some secondary advantages of the method proposed:

1) although large discretization rank gives a good approximation to the original problem, the choice of the appropriate discretization rank is not straightforward;

2) in many cases the quasidifferential descent method rapidly demonstrates the structure of the desired solution, although then the convergence to this solution may be very slow;

3) any integral restriction (for example, $||u(t)||^2_{L_2^m [0, T]} \leq C$, $C \in R$ given) will generate a complicated constraint with a large number of variables (equal to the discretization rank) after direct discretization is applied to the problem; on the contrary: the integral restriction is very natural for the variational statement of the problem solved and it is easy to add a corresponding summand to the functional $I(x, z, u)$ in order to take this restriction into account.

The main disadvantage of the method presented in this paper reduces to the computational effort: the number of iterations may be very large and the accuracy obtained is often not very high (although mostly appropriate for applications). Despite the comparative disadvantages listed, in many problems direct discretization is more preferable than the method proposed, both in terms of the number of iterations implemented and of the accuracy achieved. The current and future research work is devoted to implementing some modifications and simplicities aimed at increasing the method computational efficiency. 

\section{Conclusion}
The paper is devoted to developing a direct ``continuous'' method for a nonsmooth control problem. The problem of bringing a system with a nondifferentiable (but only quasidifferentiable) right-hand side from one point to another is considered. The admissible controls are those from the space of piecewise continuous vector-functions which belong to some parallelepiped at each moment of time. The problem of finding the steepest (the quasidifferential) descent direction was solved and the quasidifferential descent method was applied to some illustrative examples. The method is original and is qualitatively different from the existing methods as most of them are based on direct discretization of the original problem. The main and new idea implemented is to consider phase trajectory and its derivative as independent variables and to take the natural relation between these variables into account via penalty function of a special form. This idea gives possibility to calculate the quasidifferential of the minimized functional and eventually to obtain the steepest descent direction. As computational effort of the method proposed is rather high, the goal of the future research is to improve computational efficiency. Another goal is to applicate the main ideas presented to other control problems. 

\section* {Appendix}
With the help of quasidifferential calculus rules (\cite{demrub}, Ch.~III, Par. 2) at each $i \in \{1, \dots, n\}$, $j \in \{1, \dots, m\}$ and at each $t \in [0, T]$ calculate the quasidifferentials below.

if $z_i - f_i(x, u, t) < 0$. Here $-1$ is on the $(n+i)$-th place.

if $z_i - f_i(x, u, t) = 0$. Here $1$ and $-1$ are on the $(n+i)$-th place. 

$$\mathcal{D} \max \big\{u_j(t) - \overline u_j, 0 \big\} = \left[ \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ \vdots \\  0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{array} \right), \ 0_m \right], $$
if $u_j - \overline{u}_j > 0$. Here $1$ is on the $j$-th place.

if $\underline u_j - {u}_j(t) = 0$. Here $-1$ is on the $j$-th place.  

In the previous paragraph formulas the subdifferentials $\underline \partial f_i(x, u, t)$ and the superdifferentials $\overline \partial f_i(x, u, t)$, $i = \overline {1, n}$, are calculated via quasidifferential calculus apparatus as well. Book \cite{demrub} (see Ch. III, Par. 2 there) contains a detailed description of these rules for a rich class of functions. Let us give just some of these rules which were used in the formulas of the previous paragraph. Let $\xi \in R^l$. If the function $\varphi(\xi)$ is quasidifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$ and $\lambda$ is some number, then we have
$$ \lambda \, \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [ \lambda \, \underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0), \lambda \, \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ], \quad \text{if} \ \lambda \geqslant 0,$$
 $$ \lambda \, \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [ \lambda \, \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0), \lambda \, \underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ], \quad \text{if} \ \lambda < 0.$$
If the functions $\varphi_k(\xi)$, $k = \overline{1, r}$, are quasidifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then the quasidifferntial of the function $\varphi(\xi) = \max_{k = \overline{1, r}} \varphi_k(\xi)$ at this point is calculated by the formula $$ \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [\underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ,  \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ],$$
$$\underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) = \mathrm{co}\Big\{\underline\partial \varphi_k(\xi_0) - \sum_{i \in P(\xi_0), \ i \neq k} \overline\partial \varphi_i(\xi_0), \  k \in P(\xi_0) \Big\} ,$$
$$ \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) = \sum_{i \in P(\xi_0)} \overline\partial \varphi_i(\xi_0), $$
$$P(\xi_0) = \{ k \in \{1, \dots, r\} \ | \ \varphi_k(\xi_0) = \varphi(\xi_0) \} .$$
If the functions $\varphi_k(\xi)$, $k = \overline{1, r}$, are quasidifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then the quasidifferntial of the function $\varphi(\xi) = \min_{k = \overline{1, r}} \varphi_k(\xi)$ at this point is calculated by the following formula $$ \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [\underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ,  \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ],$$
$$\underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) = \sum_{j \in Q(\xi_0)} \underline\partial \varphi_j(\xi_0) ,$$
$$ \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) = \mathrm{co}\Big\{\overline\partial \varphi_k(\xi_0) - \sum_{j \in Q(\xi_0), \ j \neq k} \underline\partial \varphi_j(\xi_0), \  k \in Q(\xi_0) \Big\} , $$
$$Q(\xi_0) = \{ k \in \{1, \dots, r\} \ | \ \varphi_k(\xi_0) = \varphi(\xi_0) \} .$$
Note also that if the function $\varphi(\xi)$ is subdifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then its quasidifferential at this point  may be represented in the form $$\mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [ \underline\partial \varphi(\xi_0), 0_l ],$$ and if the function  $\varphi(\xi)$ is superdifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then its quasidifferential at this point  may be represented in the form $$\mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [ 0_l, \overline\partial \varphi(\xi_0) ].$$ These two formulas can be taken as definitions of a subdifferentiable and a superdifferentiable function respectively. If the function $\varphi(\xi)$ is differentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then its quasidifferential may be represented in the forms $$\mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [\varphi'(\xi_0), 0_l ] \ \mathrm{or} \ \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = [0_l, \varphi'(\xi_0) ], $$ where $\varphi'(\xi_0)$ is a gradient of the function $\varphi(\xi)$ at the point $\xi_0$. The latter fact indicates that there is not the only way to construct quasidifferential.
We also note that the subdifferential (the superdifferential) of the finite sum of quasidifferentiable functions is a sum of subdifferentials (superdifferentials) of the summands, i. e. if the functions $\varphi_k(\xi)$, $k = \overline{1, r}$, are quasidifferentiable at the point $\xi_0 \in R^l$, then the quasidifferential of the function $\varphi(\xi) = \sum_{k=1}^r \varphi_k(\xi)$ at this point is calculated by the formula $$ \mathcal{D} \varphi(\xi_0) = \left[  \sum_{k=1}^r \underline\partial \varphi_k(\xi_0) ,  \sum_{k=1}^r \overline\partial \varphi_k(\xi_0) \right].$$

Via the rules given and formulas (\ref{12}) and (\ref{13}) we find the quasidifferentials $\mathcal{D} I_1(x, z, u)$ and $\mathcal{D} I_3(u)$.

%\begin{abstract}
%This template is for authors who are preparing a manuscript for a
%Taylor \& Francis journal using the \LaTeX\ document preparation system
%and the \texttt{interact} class file, which is available via selected
%journals' home pages on the Taylor \& Francis website.
%\end{abstract}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%An additional abstract in another language (preceded by a translation of the article title) may be included within the \verb"abstract" environment if required.
%
%A graphical abstract may also be included if required. Within the \verb"abstract" environment you can include the code
%\begin{verbatim}
%\\\resizebox{25pc}{!}{\includegraphics{abstract.eps}}
%\end{verbatim}
%where the graphical abstract is to appear, where \verb"abstract.eps" is the name of the file containing the graphic (note that \verb"25pc" is the recommended maximum width, expressed in pica, for the graphical abstract in your manuscript).
%
%
%\subsection{Abbreviations}
%
%A list of abbreviations may be included if required, enclosed within an \texttt{abbreviations} environment, i.e.\ \verb"\begin{abbreviations}"\ldots\verb"\end{abbreviations}", immediately following the \verb"abstract" environment.
%
%
%\subsection{Keywords}
%
%A list of keywords may be included if required, enclosed within a \texttt{keywords} environment, i.e.\ \verb"\begin{keywords}"\ldots\verb"\end{keywords}". Additional keywords in other languages (preceded by a translation of the word `keywords') may also be included within the \verb"keywords" environment if required.
%
%
%\subsection{Subject classification codes}
%
%AMS, JEL or PACS classification codes may be included if required. The \texttt{interact} class file provides an \texttt{amscode} environment, i.e.\ \verb"\begin{amscode}"\ldots\verb"\end{amscode}", a \texttt{jelcode} environment, i.e.\ \verb"\begin{jelcode}"\ldots\verb"\end{jelcode}", and a \texttt{pacscode} environment, i.e.\ \verb"\begin{pacscode}"\ldots\verb"\end{pacscode}" to assist with this.
%
%
%\subsection{Additional footnotes to the title or authors' names}
%
%The \verb"\thanks" command may be used to create additional footnotes to the title or authors' names if required. Footnote symbols for this purpose should be used in the order
%$^\ast$~(coded as \verb"$^\ast$"), $\dagger$~(\verb"$\dagger$"), $\ddagger$~(\verb"$\ddagger$"), $\S$~(\verb"$\S$"), $\P$~(\verb"$\P$"), $\|$~(\verb"$\|$"),
%$\dagger\dagger$~(\verb"$\dagger\dagger$"), $\ddagger\ddagger$~(\verb"$\ddagger\ddagger$"), $\S\S$~(\verb"$\S\S$"), $\P\P$~(\verb"$\P\P$").
%
%Note that any \verb"footnote"s to the main text will automatically be assigned the superscript symbols 1, 2, 3, etc. by the class file.\footnote{If preferred, the \texttt{endnotes} package may be used to set the notes at the end of your text, before the bibliography. The symbols will be changed to match the style of the journal if necessary by the typesetter.}
%
%
%\section{Some guidelines for using the standard features of \LaTeX}
%
%\subsection{Sections}
%
%The \textsf{Interact} layout style allows for five levels of section heading, all of which are provided in the \texttt{interact} class file using the standard \LaTeX\ commands \verb"\section", \verb"\subsection", \verb"\subsubsection", \verb"\paragraph" and \verb"\subparagraph". Numbering will be automatically generated for all these headings by default.
%
%
%\subsection{Lists}
%
%Numbered lists are produced using the \texttt{enumerate} environment, which will number each list item with arabic numerals by default. For example,
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item first item
%  \item second item
%  \item third item
%\end{enumerate}
%was produced by
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item first item
%  \item second item
%  \item third item
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{verbatim}
%Alternative numbering styles can be achieved by inserting an optional argument in square brackets to each \verb"item", e.g.\ \verb"\item[(i)] first item"\, to create a list numbered with roman numerals at level one.
%
%Bulleted lists are produced using the \texttt{itemize} environment. For example,
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item First bulleted item
%  \item Second bulleted item
%  \item Third bulleted item
%\end{itemize}
%was produced by
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item First bulleted item
%  \item Second bulleted item
%  \item Third bulleted item
%\end{itemize}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%The \texttt{interact} class file will deal with positioning your figures in the same way as standard \LaTeX. It should not normally be necessary to use the optional \texttt{[htb]} location specifiers of the \texttt{figure} environment in your manuscript; you may, however, find the \verb"[p]" placement option or the \verb"endfloat" package useful if a journal insists on the need to separate figures from the text.
%
%Figure captions appear below the figures themselves, therefore the \verb"\caption" command should appear after the body of the figure. For example, Figure~\ref{sample-figure} with caption and sub-captions is produced using the following commands:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\subfloat[An example of an individual figure sub-caption.]{%
%\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{graph1.eps}}}\hspace{5pt}
%\subfloat[A slightly shorter sub-caption.]{%
%\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{graph2.eps}}}
%\caption{Example of a two-part figure with individual sub-captions
% showing that captions are flush left and justified if greater
% than one line of text.} \label{sample-figure}
%\end{figure}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\subfloat[An example of an individual figure sub-caption.]{%
%\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{graph1.eps}}}\hspace{5pt}
%\subfloat[A slightly shorter sub-caption.]{%
%\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{graph2.eps}}}
%\caption{Example of a two-part figure with individual sub-captions
% showing that captions are flush left and justified if greater
% than one line of text.} \label{sample-figure}
%\end{figure}
%
%To ensure that figures are correctly numbered automatically, the \verb"\label" command should be included just after the \verb"\caption" command, or in its argument.
%
%The \verb"\subfloat" command requires \verb"subfig.sty", which is called in the preamble of the \texttt{interactapasample.tex} file (to allow your choice of an alternative package if preferred) and included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience. Please supply any additional figure macros used with your article in the preamble of your .tex file.
%
%The source files of any figures will be required when the final, revised version of a manuscript is submitted. Authors should ensure that these are suitable (in terms of lettering size, etc.) for the reductions they envisage.
%
%The \texttt{epstopdf} package can be used to incorporate encapsulated PostScript (.eps) illustrations when using PDF\LaTeX, etc. Please provide the original .eps source files rather than the generated PDF images of those illustrations for production purposes.
%
%
%\subsection{Tables}
%
%The \texttt{interact} class file will deal with positioning your tables in the same way as standard \LaTeX. It should not normally be necessary to use the optional \texttt{[htb]} location specifiers of the \texttt{table} environment in your manuscript; you may, however, find the \verb"[p]" placement option or the \verb"endfloat" package useful if a journal insists on the need to separate tables from the text.
%
%The \texttt{tabular} environment can be used as shown to create tables with single horizontal rules at the head, foot and elsewhere as appropriate. The captions appear above the tables in the \textsf{Interact} style, therefore the \verb"\tbl" command should be used before the body of the table. For example, Table~\ref{sample-table} is produced using the following commands:
%\begin{table}
%\tbl{Example of a table showing that its caption is as wide as
% the table itself and justified.}
%{\begin{tabular}{lcccccc} \toprule
% & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Type} \\ \cmidrule{2-7}
% Class & One & Two & Three & Four & Five & Six \\ \midrule
% Alpha\textsuperscript{a} & A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 & A6 \\
% Beta & B2 & B2 & B3 & B4 & B5 & B6 \\
% Gamma & C2 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 & C6 \\ \bottomrule
%\end{tabular}}
%\tabnote{\textsuperscript{a}This footnote shows how to include
% footnotes to a table if required.}
%\label{sample-table}
%\end{table}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{table}
%\tbl{Example of a table showing that its caption is as wide as
% the table itself and justified.}
%{\begin{tabular}{lcccccc} \toprule
% & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Type} \\ \cmidrule{2-7}
% Class & One & Two & Three & Four & Five & Six \\ \midrule
% Alpha\textsuperscript{a} & A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 & A6 \\
% Beta & B2 & B2 & B3 & B4 & B5 & B6 \\
% Gamma & C2 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 & C6 \\ \bottomrule
%\end{tabular}}
%\tabnote{\textsuperscript{a}This footnote shows how to include
% footnotes to a table if required.}
%\label{sample-table}
%\end{table}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%To ensure that tables are correctly numbered automatically, the \verb"\label" command should be included just before \verb"\end{table}".
%
%The \verb"\toprule", \verb"\midrule", \verb"\bottomrule" and \verb"\cmidrule" commands are those used by \verb"booktabs.sty", which is called by the \texttt{interact} class file and included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience. Tables produced using the standard commands of the \texttt{tabular} environment are also compatible with the \texttt{interact} class file.
%
%
%\subsection{Landscape pages}
%
%If a figure or table is too wide to fit the page it will need to be rotated, along with its caption, through 90$^{\circ}$ anticlockwise. Landscape figures and tables can be produced using the \verb"rotating" package, which is called by the \texttt{interact} class file. The following commands (for example) can be used to produce such pages.
%\begin{verbatim}
%\setcounter{figure}{1}
%\begin{sidewaysfigure}
%\centerline{\epsfbox{figname.eps}}
%\caption{Example landscape figure caption.}
%\label{landfig}
%\end{sidewaysfigure}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\setcounter{table}{1}
%\begin{sidewaystable}
% \tbl{Example landscape table caption.}
%  {\begin{tabular}{@{}llllcll}
%    .
%    .
%    .
%  \end{tabular}}\label{landtab}
%\end{sidewaystable}
%\end{verbatim}
%Before any such float environment, use the \verb"\setcounter" command as above to fix the numbering of the caption (the value of the counter being the number given to the preceding figure or table). Subsequent captions will then be automatically renumbered accordingly. The \verb"\epsfbox" command requires \verb"epsfig.sty", which is called by the \texttt{interact} class file and is also included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience.
%
%Note that if the \verb"endfloat" package is used, one or both of the commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\DeclareDelayedFloatFlavor{sidewaysfigure}{figure}
%\DeclareDelayedFloatFlavor{sidewaystable}{table}
%\end{verbatim}
%will need to be included in the preamble of your .tex file, after the \verb"endfloat" package is loaded, in order to process any landscape figures and/or tables correctly.
%
%
%\subsection{Theorem-like structures}
%
%A predefined \verb"proof" environment is provided by the \texttt{amsthm} package (which is called by the \texttt{interact} class file), as follows:
%\begin{proof}
%More recent algorithms for solving the semidefinite programming relaxation are particularly efficient, because they explore the structure of the MAX-CUT problem.
%\end{proof}
%\noindent This was produced by simply typing:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{proof}
%More recent algorithms for solving the semidefinite programming
%relaxation are particularly efficient, because they explore the
%structure of the MAX-CUT problem.
%\end{proof}
%\end{verbatim}
%Other theorem-like environments (theorem, definition, remark, etc.) need to be defined as required, e.g.\ using \verb"\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}" in the preamble of your .tex file (see the preamble of \verb"interactapasample.tex" for more examples). You can define the numbering scheme for these structures however suits your article best. Please note that the format of the text in these environments may be changed if necessary to match the style of individual journals by the typesetter during preparation of the proofs.
%
%
%\subsection{Mathematics}
%
%\subsubsection{Displayed mathematics}
%
%The \texttt{interact} class file will set displayed mathematical formulas centred on the page without equation numbers if you use the \texttt{displaymath} environment or the equivalent \verb"\[...\]" construction. For example, the equation
%\[
% \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
%\]
%was typeset using the commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\[
% \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
%\]
%\end{verbatim}
%
%For those of your equations that you wish to be automatically numbered sequentially throughout the text for future reference, use the \texttt{equation} environment, e.g.
%\begin{equation}
% \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
%\end{equation}
%was typeset using the commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{equation}
% \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
%\end{equation}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Part numbers for sets of equations may be generated using the \texttt{subequations} environment, e.g.
%\begin{subequations} \label{subeqnexample}
%\begin{equation}
%     \varepsilon \rho w_{tt}(s,t) = N[w_{s}(s,t),w_{st}(s,t)]_{s},
%     \label{subeqnparta}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%     w_{tt}(1,t)+N[w_{s}(1,t),w_{st}(1,t)] = 0,   \label{subeqnpartb}
%\end{equation}
%\end{subequations}
%which was typeset using the commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{subequations} \label{subeqnexample}
%\begin{equation}
%     \varepsilon \rho w_{tt}(s,t) = N[w_{s}(s,t),w_{st}(s,t)]_{s},
%     \label{subeqnparta}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%     w_{tt}(1,t)+N[w_{s}(1,t),w_{st}(1,t)] = 0,   \label{subeqnpartb}
%\end{equation}
%\end{subequations}
%\end{verbatim}
%This is made possible by the \texttt{amsmath} package, which is called by the class file. If you put a \verb"\label" just after the \verb"\begin{subequations}" command, references can be made to the collection of equations, i.e.\ `(\ref{subeqnexample})' in the example above. Or, as the example also shows, you can label and refer to each equation individually -- i.e.\ `(\ref{subeqnparta})' and `(\ref{subeqnpartb})'.
%
%Displayed mathematics should be given end-of-line punctuation appropriate to the running text sentence of which it forms a part, if required.
%
%\subsubsection{Math fonts}
%
%\paragraph{Superscripts and subscripts}
%Superscripts and subscripts will automatically come out in the correct size in a math environment (i.e.\ enclosed within \verb"\(...\)" or \verb"$...$" commands in running text, or within \verb"\[...\]" or the \texttt{equation} environment for displayed equations). Sub/superscripts that are physical variables should be italic, whereas those that are labels should be roman (e.g.\ $C_p$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$). If the subscripts or superscripts need to be other than italic, they must be coded individually.
%
%\paragraph{Upright Greek characters and the upright partial derivative sign}
%Upright lowercase Greek characters can be obtained by inserting the letter `u' in the control code for the character, e.g.\ \verb"\umu" and \verb"\upi" produce $\umu$ (used, for example, in the symbol for the unit microns -- $\umu\mathrm{m}$) and $\upi$ (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter). Similarly, the control code for the upright partial derivative $\upartial$ is \verb"\upartial". Bold lowercase as well as uppercase Greek characters can be obtained by \verb"{\bm \gamma}", for example, which gives ${\bm \gamma}$, and \verb"{\bm \Gamma}", which gives ${\bm \Gamma}$.
%
%
%\section*{Acknowledgement(s)}
%
%An unnumbered section, e.g.\ \verb"\section*{Acknowledgements}", may be used for thanks, etc.\ if required and included \emph{in the non-anonymous version} before any Notes or References.
%
%
%\section*{Disclosure statement}
%
%An unnumbered section, e.g.\ \verb"\section*{Disclosure statement}", may be used to declare any potential conflict of interest and included \emph{in the non-anonymous version} before any Notes or References, after any Acknowledgements and before any Funding information.
%
%
%\section*{Funding}
%
%An unnumbered section, e.g.\ \verb"\section*{Funding}", may be used for grant details, etc.\ if required and included \emph{in the non-anonymous version} before any Notes or References.
%
%
%\section*{Notes on contributor(s)}
%
%An unnumbered section, e.g.\ \verb"\section*{Notes on contributors}", may be included \emph{in the non-anonymous version} if required. A photograph may be added if requested.
%
%
%\section*{Nomenclature/Notation}
%
%An unnumbered section, e.g.\ \verb"\section*{Nomenclature}" (or \verb"\section*{Notation}"), may be included if required, before any Notes or References.
%
%
%\section*{Notes}
%
%An unnumbered `Notes' section may be included before the References (if using the \verb"endnotes" package, use the command \verb"\theendnotes" where the notes are to appear, instead of creating a \verb"\section*").
%
%
%\section{References}
%
%\subsection{References cited in the text}
%
%References should be cited in accordance with \citeauthor{APA10} (APA) style, i.e.\ in alphabetical order separated by semicolons, e.g.\ `\citep{Ban77,Pia88,VL07}' or `\ldots see Smith (1985, p.~75)'. If there are two or more authors with the same surname, use the first author's initials with the surnames, e.g.\ `\citep{Lig08,Lig06}'. If there are three to five authors, list all the authors in the first citation, e.g.\ `\citep{GSSM91}'. In subsequent citations, use only the first author's surname followed by et al., e.g.\ `\citep{GSSM91}'. For six or more authors, cite the first author's name followed by et al. For two or more sources by the same author(s) in the same year, use lower-case letters (a,~b,~c, \ldots) with the year to order the entries in the reference list and use these lower-case letters with the year in the in-text citations, e.g.\ `(Green, 1981a,b)'. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor \& Francis website.
%
%Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key \verb"Nas93" in the citation form \verb"\citep{Nas93}" produces `\citep{Nas93}', and the keys \verb"Koc59", \verb"Han04" and \verb"Cla08" in the citation form \verb"\citep{Koc59,Han04,Cla08}" produce `\citep{Koc59,Han04,Cla08}'. The citation \verb"\citep{Cha08}" produces `\citep{Cha08}' where the citation first appears in the text, and `\citep{Cha08}' in any subsequent citation. The appropriate citation style for different situations can be obtained, for example, by \verb"\citet{Ovi95}" for `\citet{Ovi95}', \verb"\citealp{MPW08}" for `\citealp{MPW08}', and \verb"\citealt{Sch93}" for `\citealt{Sch93}'. Citation of the year alone may be produced by \verb"\citeyear{Sch00}", i.e.\ `\citeyear{Sch00}', or \verb"\citeyearpar{Gra05}", i.e.\ `\citeyearpar{Gra05}', or of the author(s) alone by \verb"\citeauthor{Rit74}", i.e.\ `\citeauthor{Rit74}'. Optional notes may be included at the beginning and/or end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g.\ \verb"\citep[p.~31]{Hay08}" produces `\citep[p.~31]{Hay08}'; \verb"\citep[see][pp.~73-вЂ“77]{PI51}" produces `\citep[see][pp.~73--77]{PI51}'; \verb"\citep[e.g.][]{Fel81}" produces `\citep[e.g.][]{Fel81}'. A `plain' \verb"\cite" command will produce the same results as a \verb"\citet", i.e.\ \verb"\cite{BriIP}" will produce `\cite{BriIP}'.
%
%
%\subsection{The list of references}
%
%References should be listed at the end of the main text in alphabetical order, then chronologically (earliest first), with full page ranges (where appropriate) and issue numbers (essential for journals paginated by issue). If a reference has more than seven named authors, list the first six names, followed by an ellipsis (\ldots), then the last author's name \cite[see for example][]{Gil04}.
%The following list shows some sample references prepared in the Taylor \& Francis APA style.

%\noindent Each entry takes the form:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\bibitem[short list of authors' surnames(date of publication)long list
% of authors' surnames]{key}
%Bibliography entry
%\end{verbatim}
%where `\texttt{long list of authors' surnames}' is the \emph{optional} `long' list of three, four or five names which enables them all to appear where the \verb"bibitem" is first cited in the text (if the long list is missing, the short list will be used instead), and `\texttt{key}' is the tag that is to be used as an argument for the \verb"\cite" commands in the text of the article. `\texttt{Bibliography entry}' is the material that is to appear in the list of references, suitably formatted. The commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage[longnamesfirst,sort]{natbib}
%\bibpunct[, ]{(}{)}{;}{a}{,}{,}
%\renewcommand\bibfont{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont}
%\end{verbatim}
%need to be included in the preamble of your .tex file in order to generate the citations and bibliography as described above.
%
%Instead of typing the bibliography by hand, you may prefer to create the list of references using a \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ database. For this we suggest using Erik Meijer's \texttt{apacite} package, which is available via CTAN if you do not already have it. The \verb"apacite.sty", \verb"apacite.bst" and (if your paper is written in English) \verb"english.apc" files need to be in your working folder or an appropriate directory, the commands
%\begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage[natbibapa,nodoi]{apacite}
%\setlength\bibhang{12pt}
%\renewcommand\bibliographytypesize{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont}
%\end{verbatim}
%included in the preamble of your .tex file instead of the \verb"\usepackage[]{natbib}", \verb"\bibpunct" and \verb"\renewcommand\bibfont" commands described above, and the lines
%\begin{verbatim}
%\bibliographystyle{apacite}
%\bibliography{interactapasample}
%\end{verbatim}
%included where the list of references is to appear, where \texttt{interactapasample.bib} is the bibliographic database included with the \textsf{Interact}-APA \LaTeX\ bundle (to be replaced with the name of your own .bib file). The \verb"[natbibapa]" option has to be added to \verb"\usepackage{apacite}" in order to enable citation commands of the type \verb"\citep" and \verb"\citet". \LaTeX/\textsc{Bib}\TeX\ will extract from your .bib file only those references that are cited in your .tex file and list them in the References section.
%
%Please include a copy of your .bib file and/or the final generated .bbl file among your source files if your .tex file does not contain a reference list in a \texttt{thebibliography} environment.
%
%
%\section{Appendices}
%
%Any appendices should be placed after the list of references, beginning with the command \verb"\appendix" followed by the command \verb"\section" for each appendix title, e.g.
%\begin{verbatim}
%\appendix
%\section{This is the title of the first appendix}
%\section{This is the title of the second appendix}
%\end{verbatim}
%produces:\medskip
%
%\noindent\textbf{Appendix A. This is the title of the first appendix}\medskip
%
%\noindent\textbf{Appendix B. This is the title of the second appendix}\medskip
%
%\noindent Subsections, equations, figures, tables, etc.\ within appendices will then be automatically numbered as appropriate. Some theorem-like environments may need to have their counters reset manually (e.g.\ if they are not numbered within sections in the main text). You can achieve this by using \verb"\numberwithin{remark}{section}" (for example) just after the \verb"\appendix" command.
%
%Note that if the \verb"endfloat" package is used on a document containing any appendices, the \verb"\processdelayedfloats" command must be included immediately before the \verb"\appendix" command in order to ensure that the floats belonging to the main body of the text are numbered as such.
%
%%\processdelayedfloats %%% See above for an explanation of why this command might be needed here.
%
%\appendix
%
%\section{Troubleshooting}
%
%Authors may occasionally encounter problems with the preparation of a manuscript using \LaTeX. The appropriate action to take will depend on the nature of the problem:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item[(i)] If the problem is with \LaTeX\ itself, rather than with the actual macros, please consult an appropriate \LaTeXe\ manual for initial advice. If the solution cannot be found, or if you suspect that the problem does lie with the macros, then please contact Taylor \& Francis for assistance (\texttt{latex.helpdesk@tandf.co.uk}), clearly stating the title of the journal to which you are submitting.
%\item[(ii)] Problems with page make-up (e.g.\ occasional overlong lines of text; figures or tables appearing out of order): please do not try to fix these using `hard' page make-up commands -- the typesetter will deal with such problems. (You may, if you wish, draw attention to particular problems when submitting the final version of your manuscript.)
%\item[(iii)] If a required font is not available on your system, allow \TeX\ to substitute the font and specify which font is required in a covering letter accompanying your files.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%\section{Obtaining the template and class file}
%
%\subsection{Via the Taylor \& Francis website}
%
%This article template and the \texttt{interact} class file may be obtained via the `Instructions for Authors' pages of selected Taylor \& Francis journals.
%
%Please note that the class file calls up the open-source \LaTeX\ packages booktabs.sty, epsfig.sty and rotating.sty, which will, for convenience, unpack with the downloaded template and class file. The template optionally calls for natbib.sty and subfig.sty, which are also supplied for convenience.
%
%
%\subsection{Via e-mail}
%
%This article template, the \texttt{interact} class file and the associated open-source \LaTeX\ packages are also available via e-mail. Requests should be addressed to \texttt{latex.helpdesk@tandf.co.uk}, clearly stating for which journal you require the template and class file.
