\section{Experiment Details}

The deep learning baseline experiments were run on a 3.70GHz Intel i7 processor with 64GB RAM and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPU. All other experiments were run a 2.40GHz Intel i9 processor with 32GB RAM and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile GPU. Our model is implemented using Julia in Gen, a probabilistic programming system \cite{cusumano2019gen}.
