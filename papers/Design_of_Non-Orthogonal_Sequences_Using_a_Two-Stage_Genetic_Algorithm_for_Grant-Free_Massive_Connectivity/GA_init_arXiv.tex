\begin{abstract}
In massive machine-type communications (mMTC),
grant-free access is a key enabler for a massive number of users
to be connected to a base station with low signaling overhead and low latency.
In this paper, a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed 
to design a new set of user-specific, non-orthogonal, unimodular sequences
for uplink grant-free access.
The first-stage GA is
to find a subsampling index set for a partial unitary matrix 
that can be approximated to an equiangular tight frame.
Then in the second-stage GA, we try to find a sequence to be masked to each column
of the partial unitary matrix, 
in order to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio of the resulting columns
for multicarrier transmission.
Finally, the masked columns of the matrix are proposed as new non-orthogonal sequences  
for uplink grant-free access.
Simulation results 
demonstrate that the non-orthogonal sequences designed by our two-stage GA
exhibit excellent performance 
for compressed sensing based joint activity detection and channel estimation
in uplink grant-free access.
Compared to algebraic design,
this GA-based design 
can present a set of good non-orthogonal sequences of arbitrary length, 
which provides more flexibility for uplink grant-free access in mMTC.

\section{Introduction}


\IEEEPARstart{M}{assive} connectivity of wireless devices
is essential for industrial, commercial, and critical applications
of massive machine-type communications (mMTC)~\cite{Kunz:MTC, Bockel:mMTC},
which provides a concrete platform for the Internet of Things (IoT).
%by enabling a massive connection of devices with little or no human intervention~\cite{Kunz:MTC}.
Unlike human-type communications (HTC), 
mMTC is characterized by small size data, infrequent transmission, low cost devices,
low mobility, and so on~\cite{3gpp:22368}.
%Through a grant-free access,
In practice,
mMTC systems need to support a massive number of devices with low control overhead, low latency,
and low power consumption for delay-sensitive and energy efficient communications.


Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)~\cite{Dai:noma, Dai:survey} has received a great deal of attention 
for massive connectivity in 5G wireless systems.
In code-domain NOMA, user-specific and
non-orthogonal spreading sequences
are assigned to users for their non-orthogonal multiplexing through common resources. 
%where active ones can reduce signaling overhead via uplink grant-free access. % in uplink MTC.
%There have been many research efforts for enabling massive connectivity with low complexity in code-domain NOMA. 
In sparse code multiple access (SCMA)~\cite{Baligh:SCMA}, 
sparse spreading sequences are assigned to users, % for spectrally efficient communications,
%is a
%well known research work for non-orthogonal multiple access of a massive number of devices.
%In SCMA, sparse spreading codes are assigned to devices,
where a message passing algorithm (MPA)~\cite{Zhang:MPA} and a list sphere decoding based MPA decoder~\cite{Wei:SCMA}
can be deployed for reliable multiuser detection with low complexity.  
Complex-valued spreading sequences are employed for 
multi-user shared access (MUSA)~\cite{Yuan:MUSA}, 
%as in a non-orthogonal, code-division multiple access (CDMA) style,
where the successive interference cancellation (SIC) can be performed for multiuser detection. 
Also, pattern division multiple access (PDMA)~\cite{Kang:PDMA} attempted
to enable massive connectivity with low complexity through an efficient pattern matrix design 
and a recursive approach of multiuser detection~\cite{Jamali:PDMA}.
For a survey on existing works of code-domain NOMA, readers are referred to~\cite{Dai:survey}.
Recently, the state-of-the-art technique of deep learning~\cite{Bengjo:DL} has been applied
for multiuser detection in uplink code-domain NOMA systems~\cite{Ye:deep}$-$\cite{Siva:dnn}.



%For fast and efficient connectivity,
Grant-free access is of tremendous interest to connect a massive number of users to mMTC systems
with low latency and low signaling overhead~\cite{Cirik:toward}.
In uplink grant-free access, 
%we assume that
active users send their data with no access-grant procedure.
%where the transmitted signals are spread onto multiple subcarriers by their own spreading sequences
%and superimposed at a base station (BS) receiver.
Then, a base station (BS) receiver has to identify active users with no aid of a grant procedure
and detect each active user's data from the superimposed signal.
The principle of 
compressed sensing (CS)~\cite{Eldar:CS} can be applied for multiuser detection in uplink grant-free access,  %~\cite{Du:joint}.,
exploiting the sparse activity that many users are present in a cell, % to be accommodated by a BS, 
but only a few of them are active at a time.
Many research articles~\cite{Abebe:iter}$-$\cite{Schober:meet} demonstrated that 
a CS-based detector can be successfully deployed at BS  
% exploiting the \emph{sparse} activity,
for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and/or data detection in uplink grant-free access.


%In uplink grant-free access,

it is crucial to design a set of non-orthogonal sequences with low correlation,

%and multiuser detection (MUD).
Moreover, if the transmitted signals of active users are spread % of devices 
onto multiple subcarriers,
the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) 
will cause signal distortion
%due to the non-linearity of power amplifiers~\cite{Litsyn:peak},
%which

%Therefore, we have another requirement of PAPR reduction in spreading sequence design
%for uplink grant-free NOMA.
Recently, efforts have been made to reduce the PAPR of uplink multicarrier signals in SCMA~\cite{Yani:ra, Mherich:golden}.

Elad~\cite{Elad:opt} launched an algorithmic design for a sensing matrix
by minimizing the average measure of the coherence iteratively.
In~\cite{Xu:opt}$-$\cite{Zhang:opt}, several algorithms have been proposed for

Other algorithms can be found in~\cite{Duarte:learn} and \cite{Lu:dir}. 
From these efforts, each sensing matrix optimized algorithmically can offer a set of 
non-orthogonal sequences % with its columns 
for reliable CS-based detection.
In~\cite{Chun:DL} and \cite{Kim:DL}, 
deep learning (DL) techniques have been also applied for pilot or spreading sequence design. 
In general, the non-orthogonal sequences obtained by algorithmic and DL-based designs 
can take arbitrary elements with no structure,
which may not be suitable for cost efficient implementation in mMTC devices.

Recently, the genetic algorithm (GA)~\cite{Holland:gen} has been applied 
for sensing matrix optimization in specific applications,

and maximizing the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSN)~\cite{Leven:moga}.
%In~\cite{Chen:ISAR}, GA has been used to optimize a measurement matrix for radar imaging.
%Similarly, the modified adaptive GA has been proposed in~\cite{Nie:maga}
%for optimizing pilot allocation in sparse channel estimation.
%The multiple objective genetic algorithm

GA has been used
to find subsampling patterns to optimize partial Fourier matrices

%which is also equivalent to finding a partial Fourier matrix minimizing the coherence.
%However, the above results are only about partial Fourier matrices

%However, a more rigorous study is necessary

In this paper, 
we propose a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) to design a new set of non-orthogonal sequences\footnote{
The resulting sequences from our design can be used as
spreading, pilot, or signature sequences, depending on specific access schemes.}

cost efficient implementation in an mMTC device.
Each stage of GA makes an evolutionary approach to reach an optimized result by transforming
and improving the intermediate outcomes. 
The first-stage GA
is to find a subsampling index set to optimize\footnote{In this paper, 
`\emph{optimize}' does not mean to find a global optimum, since GA may converge to local optima.}

approximating it to an ETF,

%The cost function of GA is defined by the Frobenius norm of the upper triangular part of $\Abu^H \Abu - \Wbu $
%above the diagonal,
%where the off-diagonal entries of $\Wbu$ are the Welch bound equality (WBE).
Then, the second-stage GA tries to find a sequence to be commonly masked 
to each column of the partial unitary matrix from the first-stage,
in order to reduce the PAPR of the resulting columns.
%in an effort 
%reducing the top $30 \%$ average of PAPR of the resulting columns.
Note that masking each column with a common sequence does not change
the inner products and their distribution among the resulting column pairs.
Finally, the masked columns of the partial unitary matrix
are proposed as new non-orthogonal sequences with low correlation and low PAPR properties,
which can be uniquely assigned to users  
for uplink grant-free access.

Through simulations, the phase transition diagrams

reveal that the

\section{System Model}
%In uplink grant-free NOMA, % this paper assumes 
%For uplink grant-free access,
In this paper, we consider a two-phase grant-free access scheme~\cite{Liu:mimo, Liu:massive}
for a single-cell massive connectivity. 
In an mMTC cell, a base station (BS) receiver equipped with $J$ antennas
accommodates total $N$ devices each of which transmits with a single antenna.
For a fully grant-free access, % of many devices,
we assume that devices are \emph{static}\footnote{
	If devices are moving from cell to cell, 
	it is hard to guarantee unique sequence assignment in a fully grant-free manner
	for all devices in a cell, and 
	some coordination may be required to assign unique sequences to devices.}
in a cell and thus BS accommodates a fixed set of devices
having their own user-specific sequences. 
In the first phase, each active device transmits its sequence as a dedicated pilot,
and the BS receiver then tries to identify active devices and estimate their channel profiles 
from the superimposed pilots.
Data can be directly transmitted in the second-phase from active devices with no grant from BS.
In this two-phase scheme, 
we assume that the channels and the device activity remain unchanged during $L$ slots for pilot 
and data transmissions.
%We also assume that devices are synchronized in a frame structure
%of $J$ time slots, where the activity of each device remains unchanged during an entire frame~\cite{Abebe:iter, Wang:struct}.
%only a few devices out of $N$ ones are assumed to be active in a frame.
%Each active device sends a pilot symbol for channel estimation
%in the first slot of a frame, and 
%subsequently sends data symbols for the following $J-1$ slots~\cite{Du:joint, Ahn:ep}.
Figure~\ref{fig:system} illustrates this system model.
%For an illustration of this system model, refer to Figure 1 of~\cite{Du:joint}.

\end{figure}




%At a time slot $t$ of a frame,
%While a massive number of devices are present in a cell,
%For massive connectivity, we assume that $N$ is large, but
%only a few of them are active at a time. % , where the number of active devices is far less than $N$.
With sparse activity, 
each device is assumed to be active with probability $p_a$ in an i.i.d. manner,
where active devices are synchronized.
%The device activity remains unchanged over $L$ slot duration, 
In an access time, 
an activity indicator vector can be defined by $\balp = (\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_N)^T$ with
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:act}
	\alpha_n = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1, & \mbox{ if device } n \mbox{ is active}, \\

%From $\alpha_n$, 
where $\mS = \{ n \mid \alpha_n = 1 \}$ is a set of active devices and
the number of active devices is $|\mS| = \sum_{n=1} ^N \alpha_n = K \ll N$.

When device $n$ is active, 
it transmits its unique pilot
sequence $\sbu_n = (s_{1,n}, \cdots, s_{M,n})^T $ % as a dedicated pilot
over $M$ subcarriers for grant-free access, where $M < N$.
We consider a flat Rayleigh fading channel, 
where the channel gain remains unchanged during the coherence time interval of $L$ slots.
Let $\hbu_n = \left(h_n ^{(1)}, \cdots, h_n ^{(J)} \right)^T$, $ 1 \leq n \leq N$,
be a channel vector from device $n$, 
where $h_n ^{(t)}$ is the channel gain between device $n$ and BS receiver antenna $t$.
Assuming that the path loss and shadowing effects are known and can be removed by BS,
we have $\hbu_n \sim \mathcal{CN}(\bf{0}, \Ibu) $. 
%Also, the transmit signal power from each active device is assumed to be
%identical, due to perfect power control.
Then, the received signal at antenna $t$ can be represented % in frequency-domain 
by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:y}
	\ybu^{(t)} = \sum_{n=1} ^N \alpha_n  h_n ^{(t)} \sbu_n  + \wbu ^{(t)}
	=  \Sbu \xbu ^{(t)} + \wbu ^{(t)}, %\quad t = 1, \cdots, J,
	%= \Gbu^{(t)} \xbu^{(t)} + \wbu ^{(t)},
\end{equation}
where $\xbu ^{(t)} = \left(\alpha_1 h_1 ^{(t)}, \cdots, \alpha_N h_N ^{(t)} \right)^T$
for $ 1 \leq t \leq J$. 
In~\eqref{eq:y},
$\Sbu = [\sbu_1, \cdots, \sbu_N] \in \C^{M \times N} $ is a matrix of pilot sequences,
%$\hbu = (h_1, \cdots, h_N)^T \sim \mathcal{CN}(\bf{0}, \Ibu) $, 
%where $h_n$ is the channel gain between device $n$ and BS, and
and $\wbu^{(t)} \sim \mathcal{CN}(\textbf{0}, \sigma_n ^2 \Ibu) $ is the complex Gaussian noise vector
at antenna $t$. 


Collecting the $J$ received signals of~\eqref{eq:y}, 
we have a multiple measurement vector (MMV) % joint sparse 
model of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mmv}
\Ybu = \Sbu \Xbu + \Wbu,
\end{equation}
where $\Ybu = \left[\ybu^{(1)}, \cdots, \ybu^{(J)} \right]$,
$\Xbu = \left[\xbu^{(1)}, \cdots, \xbu^{(J)} \right]$,
and $\Wbu = \left[\wbu^{(1)}, \cdots, \wbu^{(J)} \right]$, respectively.
Due to the activity indicator $\balp$, 
it is clear that $\Xbu$ has the row-wise sparsity with $K$ nonzero 
and $N-K$ zero rows.
%Note that the BS receiver attempts to detect the activity indicator $\balp$
%and estimate the channel vectors $\hbu_n$ for $n \in \mS$ 
Then, BS can apply
a joint sparse recovery algorithm to solve the MMV problem of~\eqref{eq:mmv},
in order to detect the activity indicator $\balp$ and estimate the channel vector $\hbu_n$ for $n \in \mS$.
%obtain $\widehat{\Xbu} ^{\widehat{\mS}}$
%by solving the MMV problem, 
%where $\widehat{\mS}$ is an estimate of $\mS$ and % set of active devices.
%$\widehat{\Xbu} ^{\widehat{\mS}}$ is an estimate of $\Xbu^\mS$, respectively.
If the nonzero rows of $\Xbu$ are estimated,
the row indices mean a detected index set of active devices, denoted by $\widehat{\mS}$, 
while the coefficients of each nonzero row give %$\widehat{\hbu}_n$,
an estimated channel vector $\widehat{\hbu}_n$ for $n \in \widehat{\mS}$. % between the active device and BS, where $n \in \widehat{\mS}$.
The CS-based joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE)
complete the first phase of uplink grant-free access.
In the second phase, the BS receiver detects data from active devices
with the knowledge of device identity and channel profiles obtained from the first phase~\cite{Liu:mimo, Liu:massive}.
In this paper, we restrict our attention to joint AUD and CE in the first phase
via joint sparse recovery under the CS MMV model.

\begin{rem}\label{rm:one}
A CS MMV model can also be applied for \emph{one-shot} detection
in uplink grant-free NOMA~\cite{Du:joint, Yu:binary}.
%Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:system}, 
In this system, each active device transmits its unique spreading sequence of length $M$,
spread onto $M$ subcarriers,  %  in uplink grant-free NOMA,
carrying its pilot and data over $J$ time slots.
Assuming that the channels and the device activity remain unchanged, % over $J$ slots,
the received signals over $J$ slots are also modeled by \eqref{eq:mmv}.
A BS receiver equipped with a single antenna
then conducts CS-based joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection,
by solving the MMV problem of \eqref{eq:mmv}.

\section{Framework for Sequence Design}
The goal of this paper is to present a set of non-orthogonal sequences
for grant-free massive connectivity.
In CS MMV model, the sequence set forms the matrix $\Sbu$ in \eqref{eq:mmv}, where
the problem of sequence design
boils down to designing a sensing matrix for reliable CS-based detection.
This section outlines a framework for sensing matrix design using the genetic algorithm (GA),
which ultimately provides a set of good non-orthogonal sequences for uplink grant-free access.

\subsection{Partial Unitary Matrices}

Compressed sensing (CS)~\cite{Eldar:CS} %\cite{Donoho:CS}$-$\cite{CanTao:univ}
is to reconstruct an $N$-dimensional sparse signal $\xbu$
from its underdetermined $M$-dimensional measurement $\ybu = \Abu \xbu$, 
where $M < N$.
The signal $\xbu $ is called \emph{$K$-sparse}
if it has at most $K$ nonzero elements,
%\footnote{Under the system model of this paper, it suffices to assume that a signal $\xbu$
%is sparse in the identity basis.},
where $K \ll N$. 
In CS techniques, it is essential to design a good $M \times N$ sensing matrix $\Abu$,
%constructively or algorithmically, 
in order to guarantee reliable reconstruction of sparse signals.
%In CS theory, it is well known that 
%if the sensing matrix $\Abu $ satisfies the \emph{restricted isometry property (RIP)}~\cite{Eldar:CS},
%stable and robust reconstruction of sparse signals can be guaranteed.
%In this letter, we assume that the sparsifying basis is identity, or $\Psibu = \Ibu$,
%which results in $\Abu = \Phibu$.

%When $\Abu$ is a purely random matrix with Gaussian distributed entries, %$\mathbf{\Gamma}=\mathbf{\Phi}\Psibu^H$
%it obeys the RIP with high probability, as long as $M\geq \mO (K \log (N/K))$~\cite{Eldar:CS, Baraniuk:rip}.
%%However, this matrix is computationally expensive, and
%In practice, however, a \emph{structured} random matrix can be more desirable
%than the computationally expensive random ones.
%%for the benefits of low complexity and simple implementation.
%A random or structural subsampling of unitary matrices~\cite{Duarte:struct}$-$\cite{Zhang:utf} 
%is a well known operation to achieve \emph{partial} unitary sensing matrices,
%which presents a theoretical recovery guarantee and allows fast and efficient processing.
%%A more general framework of modulated unit-norm tight frames
%%has been presented in~\cite{Zhang:utf}.
%A fully deterministic matrix, e.g., \cite{DeVore:det}$-$\cite{Yu:OOC},
%can also be employed for fast and efficient CS processing. 
%Deterministic construction presents a coherence-based recovery guarantee~\cite{Donoho:opt}, 
%which is however weaker than the RIP-based guarantee.
%Moreover, the available dimensions of deterministic matrices are limited. 
%A \emph{structured} random matrix is desirable for CS in practice,
%thanks to the computational efficiency.
%for the benefits of low complexity and simple implementation.
%By subsampling some rows of a unitary matrix,
Taking some rows out of a unitary matrix
%resulting in a \emph{partial} unitary matrix~\cite{Duarte:struct}, %$-$\cite{Zhang:utf},
%is a well known structured random matrix, obtained by taking some rows out of a unitary matrix,
is a well known operation to obtain a \emph{partial} unitary matrix~\cite{Duarte:struct} % a good sensing matrix 
that %\emph{structured} random matrices,
enjoys practical benefits as well as theoretical CS recovery guarantee.
A partial unitary matrix is formulated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S-single}
	\Abu  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \mathbf{R}_{\Omega}\Ubu \triangleq \Ubu_\Omega,
\end{equation}
%is an example of a structured random matrix,
where $\Ubu$ is an $N \times N$ unitary matrix of $\Ubu \Ubu^* = \Ubu^* \Ubu = N \Ibu$.
In~\eqref{eq:S-single}, $\mathbf{R}_\Omega$ is a subsampling operator selecting 
$M$ rows out of $N$ ones whose indices are specified by $\Omega \subset \{1, \cdots, N\}$, where $|\Omega| = M$. 
%Such measurement operators can be easily implemented by convolving $\mathbf{x}$ with a filter $\abu$
%followed by subsampling $\Rbu_\Omega$.
If the indices of $\Omega$ are selected randomly, %  subsampling operator, 
%it is known that 
$\Abu = \Ubu_\Omega$ %obeys the RIP with high probability,
guarantees reliable CS reconstruction % of $\xbu$ %from $\ybu$ 
theoretically with high probability,
provided that $M \geq \mO ( K \log^4 N)$~\cite{Rud:sparse}.
In practice, a partial unitary matrix allows fast and efficient measurement and reconstruction for CS,
thanks to the fast unitary transform, e.g., fast Fourier or Hadamard transform.
%provided that $M \geq \mO (\mu^2(\Ubu) K \log^4 N)$~\cite{Rud:sparse},
%where $\mu(\Ubu)$ denotes the maximum magnitude of the entries of $\Ubu$.
%Along with the theoretical recovery guarantee, 
%The partial unitary matrices are promising in several applications such as
%channel estimation, Fourier optics, coded aperture imaging
%and radar~\cite{Romb:rand}.

To design unimodular sequences, 
we begin with a unitary matrix $\Ubu$ whose elements take the magnitude of $1$.
%Given a unitary matrix $\Ubu$, 
Then, the first stage of sequence design 
attempts to find a subsampling index set $\Omega$
to optimize a partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_\Omega$ for reliable CS reconstruction.
%where %each column is a base sequence. 
%we assume that each element of $\Ubu$ is $1$ to obtain unimodular sequences in the end.



\subsection{PAPR Reduction}
%Let $\abu = (a_0, \cdots, a_{M-1})^T$ be a $q$-ary sequence of length $M$, where $a_i \in \Z_q$. %  \{ 0, 1, \cdots, q-1\}$.
%Then, its \emph{modulated} sequence is given by
%$\bbu = (b_0, \cdots, b_{M-1})^T$, %  be a $q$-ary modulated sequence of length $M$, 
%where $b_i = e^{ j \frac{2 \pi a_i}{q} }$. % $b_i= e^{j \frac{2 \pi a_i}{q}}$. 
In system model of Section II, 
if the sequence $\sbu_n $ %of device $n$ 
is transmitted through $M$ subcarriers,
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of its OFDM signal is determined by~\cite{Litsyn:peak}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:papr}
	{\rm PAPR} (\sbu_n)= \max_{t \in [0, 1) } 
	\frac{ \left| \sum_{i=1} ^{M} s_{m, n} e^{j 2 \pi (m-1) t} \right|^2 }{ M} ,
	%\frac{ \left| \sum_{i=0} ^{2^m-1} b_i e^{j 2 \pi i t} \right|^2 }{ \sum_{i=0} ^{2^m-1} |b_i |^2  } .
\end{equation}
where $j=\sqrt{-1}$.
In~\eqref{eq:papr}, we assumed that $\sbu_n $ is unimodular, i.e., $|s_{m, n}| =1$, for $m=1, \cdots, M$. 
%where $M=2^m$.
%In~\eqref{eq:papr},
%the computation of peak power containing a continuous-time signal
%can be approximated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the
%oversampled, discrete signal~\cite{Litsyn:peak}.
% It is well known that each modulated Golay complementary sequence has the PAPR of at most $2$~\cite{Jedwab:RM}.
%From the PAPR of all the sequences $\sbu_1, \cdots, \sbu_N$, 
%Then, the PAPR of the sequence set $\Sbu = [\sbu_1, \cdots, \sbu_N]$
%%in~\eqref{eq:y} 
%is defined by 
%\[
%{\rm PAPR} (\Sbu) = \max_{n = 1, \cdots,N} {\rm PAPR(\sbu_n)}.
%\]

Given a partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_\Omega$, 
we try to reduce the PAPR of
the column sequences\footnote{
If $\Ubu$ has a column of all ones, like the Fourier or Hadamard matrix,
the maximum PAPR of the column sequences of its partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_\Omega$ has the highest value of $M$,
regardless of $\Omega$.}.
%%i.e., ${\rm PAPR} (\Ubu_{\Omega}) = M$.}.
For PAPR reduction, we apply
%In the second design stage,
a unimodular and complex-valued sequence $\vbu = (v_1, \cdots, v_{M})^T$   
as a common mask to each column of $\Ubu_\Omega$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mask}
\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu}  
= {\rm diag} (\vbu) \cdot \Ubu_\Omega.
\end{equation}
In~\eqref{eq:mask}, we use
%we assume that 
a modulated $q$-ary sequence for $\vbu$, i.e., $v_m = e^{j \frac{2 \pi a_m}{q}}$,
where $a_m \in \Z_q$ for $m=1, \cdots, M$.
Then, it is clear that the inner product of a column pair in $\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu}$
is identical to that of the corresponding pair in $\Ubu_\Omega$, since
$\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu} ^* \Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu} = \Ubu_\Omega ^* \Ubu_\Omega$,
which suggests that the new matrix $\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu}$ may exhibit 
the same performance of CS-based detection as the matrix $\Ubu_\Omega$.

In the second design stage, we search for a masking sequence $\vbu$
that allows the column sequences of $\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu}$ to have a desired PAPR property,
maintaining the performance of reliable CS reconstruction from the first design stage.

%to enhance the PAPR property of the columns of $\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu}$. % as low as possible.
%the PAPR of each column of $\Ubu_{\Omega, \vbu} $ as low as possible.



\subsection{Genetic Algorithm}
The genetic algorithm (GA) is an evolutionary technique
to solve an optimization problem that is computationally intractable~\cite{Holland:gen}.
Inspired by the evolutionary mechanism in nature,
GA transforms and evolves \emph{chromosomes} through crossover, mutation, selection, population updates, and so on.
Through a sufficient number of generations,
GA converges to a fittest chromosome, which can be a solution to the optimization problem. 
%By converging the local optima quickly,
Thanks to the fast convergence to local optima,
GA has attracted much attention in machine learning and data mining~\cite{Freitas:survey}$-$\cite{Viv:intel}.
Recently, GA has expanded its application to other areas, e.g., %communications and signal processing, including
channel coding~\cite{Hebbes:turbo}$-$\cite{brink:polar}, spreading code design~\cite{Dam:seq, Nat:evol},
CS recovery~\cite{Conde:sparse}$-$\cite{Erkoc:evol}
and matrix optimization~\cite{Chen:ISAR}$-$\cite{Leven:moga}, etc.
%While the GA has been used to optimize subsampling patterns for partial Fourier matrices
%in \cite{Chen:ISAR} and \cite{Nie:maga}, 



In Section III.A and III.B, 
we introduced two design stages to obtain a set of good sequences.
At each stage, the design goal can be specified by
an optimization problem that needs to be solved by GA. 
Given a unitary matrix $\Ubu$, 
the objective of the first design stage is to find a fittest chromosome 
or subsampling index set $\Omega$ in~\eqref{eq:S-single}. 
The optimization problem 
for this objective can be formulated by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt}
	\Omega_{\rm opt} = \underset{\Omega \subset \{1, \cdots, N\}, |\Omega| = M}{\mbox{argmin}} \ f_1 (\Ubu_\Omega), 
	%  \mbox{ subject to } \Ubu_\Omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \Rbu_{\Omega} \Ubu,
\end{equation} 
where $f_1 (\Ubu_\Omega)$ is a cost function of the first-stage optimization.
%Different applications may define the cost function differently depending on the requirements. 
The cost function needs to be a good metric 
that reflects the performance of CS reconstruction
with the partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_{\Omega}$. 
The first-stage GA tries to minimize the cost function $f_1 (\Ubu_\Omega)$ through evolution steps,
in order to find a solution to~\eqref{eq:opt}.
%to find a fittest chromosome or subsampling index set. 
%For example, the GA tried to minimize the number of measurements~\cite{Chen:ISAR}, where 
%$f(\Ubu_\Omega) = |\Omega| $, while preserving the image quality with a punishment factor.
%In~\cite{Nie:maga}, the cost function was the mutual coherence of $\Abu$,
%i.e., $f(\Ubu_\Omega) = \mu(\Abu) = \max_{ 1 \leq i \neq j \leq N  }
%\frac{\left| \left \langle \abu_{i} ,   \abu_{j}  \right \rangle \right| }
%{\| \abu_{i} \|_2 \| \abu_{j} \|_2}$, 
%where $\abu_i$ and $\abu_j$ are the $i$th and the $j$th columns of $\Abu = \Ubu_\Omega$, respectively.


When the first-stage GA is completed, 
the partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$ with an optimized subsampling index set $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ 
is available for the second design stage. 
Given $\Omega_{\rm opt}$, 
the second-stage GA tries to find a fittest chromosome or unimodular masking sequence $\vbu$ of length $M$,
which is a solution to another optimization problem of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt2}
	\vbu_{\rm opt} = \underset{\vbu \in \mV_{q, M}}{\mbox{argmin}} \ f_2 (\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu}) ,
\end{equation}
where $\mV_{q, M}$ is a set of all modulated $q$-ary sequences of length $M$.
In~\eqref{eq:opt2}, $f_2 (\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu})$ is a cost function of 
the second-stage optimization, which
%The cost function $f_2 (\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu})$
should be a metric for the PAPR property of 
the column sequences of $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu} $.
The second-stage GA tries to enhance the PAPR property with $\vbu_{\rm opt}$,
maintaining the performance of $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$ for reliable CS reconstruction.
 
Finally, if $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ and $\vbu_{\rm opt}$ are found by the two-stage GA,
we obtain the matrix $\Sbu = \Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$ in~\eqref{eq:mmv}, 
where the column sequences are proposed as non-orthogonal sequences with low PAPR  
for reliable CS-based detection in uplink grant-free access.
In next section, our two-stage GA will be described 
with the details % of our two-stage GA
to find $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ and $\vbu_{\rm opt}$, respectively.
%which is a proposed design process for spreading sequences of uplink grant-free NOMA.


%In this letter, 
%we employ the GA to find an optimized subsampling index set $\Omega_{\rm opt}$
%by solving \eqref{eq:opt}.
%We scrutinize the effectiveness of GA
%for optimizing various partial unitary matrices  
%over a wide range of compression and sparsity ratios.  


\section{Two-Stage Genetic Algorithm}
In this section, we describe the evolutionary steps of our two-stage GA. % the genetic algorithm
The first-stage GA is to find an optimized subsampling index set $\Omega_{\rm opt} \subset \{1, \cdots, N\}$ 
with $|\Omega_{\rm opt}| = M$, where $M$ and $N$ are fixed.
Given $\Omega_{\rm opt}$, 
the second-stage GA then attempts to find an optimized masking sequence $\vbu_{\rm opt} \in \mV_{q, M}$,
where $q = N$.



\subsection{Stage 1: Subsampling Optimization}

\subsubsection{Initialization}
A population $\mP_1$ is defined by a collection of $T_1$ subsampling index sets, i.e.,
$\mP_1 = (\Omega_1, \Omega_2, \cdots, \Omega_{T_1})$,
where $\Omega_t \subset \{1, \cdots, N\}$ with $|\Omega_t| = M$ for $t = 1, \cdots, T_1$.
Initially, the indices of $\Omega_t$ are selected randomly. % from $\{1, \cdots, N\}$.

\subsubsection{Cost Function}
%Instead of mutual coherence, 
In the first-stage, we propose the cost function for an index set $\Omega_t$ by
%the cost function is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cost}
	f_1(\Ubu_{\Omega_t}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N(N-1)}} \left \| {\rm abs} \left(\Ubu_{\Omega_t} ^* \Ubu_{\Omega_t} \right) - \Gbu_W \right \|_F,  
\end{equation}
where $\Gbu_W \in \R^{N \times N}$ is a matrix with diagonal entries of $1$ and off-diagonal entries 
of $\sqrt{\frac{N-M}{M(N-1)}}$.
Intuitively, the cost function of \eqref{eq:cost} represents
the average (rms-sense) distance between the inner product of a column pair of $\Ubu_{\Omega_t}$ 
and the Welch bound equality (WBE)~\cite{Welch:low}.
%By minimizing 
Attempting to minimize the cost function, 
the first-stage GA % attempts to %find an optimized index set % $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ 
makes the inner product of a column pair of $\Ubu_{\Omega_t}$ closer to the WBE,
which approximates the resulting matrix to an equiangular tight frame (ETF)~\cite{Kov:frames}.
%This cost function for a complex-valued $\Ubu_\Omega$ in general
The target matrix $\Gbu_W$ is similar to, but not the same as the one in  
the convex set (e.g. (12) in~\cite{Vahid:grad} and (14) in~\cite{Li:opt}) for 
optimizing CS matrices.
As remarked by \cite{Li:opt},
it is more reasonable to measure a distance from $\Gbu_W$ in~\eqref{eq:cost}, rather than $\Ibu$, 
which has been confirmed by the optimization of~\cite{Vahid:grad}. %  showed better performance with $\Wbu$.
%the former confirmed better performance of the optimization in \cite{Vahid:grad}. 

\subsubsection{Crossover}
%Note that each subsampling index set of a population $\mP$ is
%a chromosome in GA.
In population $\mP_1$,
let us 
consider a pair of index sets $\Omega_{t_1}$ and $\Omega_{t_2}$, $1 \leq t_1 \neq t_2 \leq T_1$, where
we assume
$f_1 \left(\Ubu_{\Omega_{t_1}} \right) < f_1 \left(\Ubu_{\Omega_{t_2}} \right)$. Then,
%$\mu \left(\Abu_{\Omega_{t_1}} \right) < \mu \left(\Abu_{\Omega_{t_2}} \right)$.
$d_1 = \lceil \beta_1 \cdot M \rceil$ and 
$d_2 = M - d_1$ indices are randomly selected from $\Omega_{t_1}$ and $\Omega_{t_2}$, respectively,
where $\beta_1 > 0.5$.
Finally, the selected indices, which should be all distinct, % so that 
are combined to generate a new index set through \emph{crossover}. 
In other words, we create a new subsampling index set by combining parents,
where a parent index set with a lower cost function
is more involved in creating its offspring.
We apply the crossover for every pair of parent index sets from $\mP_1$, % with $\beta_1 = 0.7$,
which yields a new population $\mC_1$ of size $ \binom{T_1}{2} = \frac{T_1(T_1-1)}{2}$ at each evolution step.



\subsubsection{Mutation}
In nature,
parts of a chromosome can be mutated in a generation,
which provides diversity for evolution.
In the first-stage GA, % a single index is 
$\mu_1$ indices are randomly selected from each index set % $\Omega_t$ 
in $\mP_1$,
which is then replaced by new (random) ones through \emph{mutation}.
At each evolution step, 
we apply the mutation to all index sets in $\mP_1$, % with $\mu_1 = 1$,
which yields a new population $\mM_1$ of size $T_1$.

\subsubsection{Population Update}
Through crossover and mutation,
we have a new, intermediate population $\mI_1 = \mP_1 + \mC_1 + \mM_1$,
%Even if there are identical chromosomes in $\mI_1$, the possibility will be extremely low, and 
%we treat them as separate ones.},
where the size\footnote{%The chromosomes in $\mI_1$ (or $\mI_2$) are highly likely to be distinct.
Identical chromosomes in $\mI_1$ (or $\mI_2$), if any, are treated as separate ones.} 
is $ |\mI_1| = T_1 + \binom{T_1}{2} + T_1 =  \frac{T_1(T_1+3)}{2}$.
From $\mI_1$, we select the $T_1$ index sets % from $\mS$ 
with the $T_1$ lowest cost functions of \eqref{eq:cost}.
%according to the cost function in \eqref{eq:cost}.
%In other words, we choose $T$ index sets that have the lowest .
The population $\mP_1$ is then updated by the $T_1$ fittest index sets
at each evolution step. 

\subsubsection{Iteration and Selection}
In the first-stage GA, 
the evolution steps of crossover, mutation, and population update
are repeated by a predefined number of iterations, denoted by $I_{\max, 1}$.
In the end, the fittest index set of $\mP_1$, which has the lowest cost function of \eqref{eq:cost},
will be selected as an optimized subsampling index set $\Omega_{\rm opt}$. 
 
Algorithm 1 describes the entire steps of the first-stage GA
to optimize a subsampling index set. % for partial unitary matrices.

\subsection{Stage 2: Masking Sequence Optimization}


\subsubsection{Initialization}
In the second-stage GA, a population consists of $T_2$ masking sequences, i.e.,
%is defined by %$\mP_2$ by a collection of $T$ candidates of subsampling index sets, i.e.,
$\mP_2 = (\vbu_1, \cdots, \vbu_{T_2})$, where
each element of $\vbu_t = (v_{1, t}, \cdots, v_{M, t})^T$ %   
is $ v_{m, t} = e^{j \frac{2 \pi a_{m, t}}{N}}$ for $m = 1, \cdots, M$ and $t = 1, \cdots, T_2$.
Initially, $a_{m, t} $ is randomly taken from $\Z_N$.


\subsubsection{Cost Function}
Note that the partial unitary matrix $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$
is available %in the second-stage GA 
by the optimized subsampling index set $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ from the first-stage GA.
%Instead of mutual coherence, 
In the second-stage GA, the cost function for a masking sequence $\vbu_t$ is proposed by
%the cost function is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cost2}
	f_2(\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t}) = \frac{1}{|\mK_\delta|}\sum_{\pbu_n \in \mK_\delta} {\rm PAPR} (\pbu_n)  ,
\end{equation}
where $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t} = {\rm diag}(\vbu_t) \cdot \Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}
= [\pbu_1, \cdots, \pbu_N] \triangleq \Pbu$.
%where $\pbu_n$ is a column of $\Pbu = \Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu} = [\pbu_1, \cdots, \pbu_N]$.
In~\eqref{eq:cost2}, $\mK_\delta$ is a set of columns in $\Pbu$
whose PAPR belong to the top $ \delta  \%$, where $|\mK_\delta| = \left\lfloor \frac{\delta N}{100} \right\rfloor$.
That is, $f_2(\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t}) $ is the average of top $\delta \%$ PAPR
of $\Pbu$, which will be minimized % by the second-stage GA 
to enhance the PAPR distribution
of the columns of $\Pbu$. 



\subsubsection{Crossover}
%Note that each subsampling index set of a population $\mP$ is
%a chromosome in GA.
As in the first-stage GA,
%In the population $\mP_1$,
%let us 
we consider a pair of sequences $\vbu_{t_1}$ and $\vbu_{t_2}$ from $\mP_2$, $1 \leq t_1 \neq t_2 \leq T_2$, where
$f_2 \left(\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{t_1}} \right) < f_2 \left(\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{t_2}} \right)$.
%$\mu \left(\Abu_{\Omega_{t_1}} \right) < \mu \left(\Abu_{\Omega_{t_2}} \right)$.
Then, the first $d_1 = \lceil \beta_2 \cdot M \rceil$ elements from $\vbu_{t_1}$
and the last $d_2 = M - d_1 $ elements from $\vbu_{t_2}$ are combined to generate a new masking sequence,
where $\beta_2 > 0.5$.
%In other words, we create a new subsampling index set by combining parents,
%where a parent index set with the lower cost function %coherence 
%is more involved in creating its offspring.
Applying the crossover for every pair of sequences in $\mP_2$,
we have a new population $\mC_2$ of size $ \binom{T_2}{2} = \frac{T_2(T_2-1)}{2}$
at each evolution step.



\subsubsection{Mutation}
For mutation, the second-stage GA % a single element 
randomly selects $\mu_2$ elements from each sequence % $\vbu_t$ 
in $\mP_2$,
where each element is replaced by a new (random) $N$-ary modulated one. %$e^{j \frac{2 \pi a }{N}}$,
%where $a \in \Z_N$.
%At each evolution step, 
We obtain
a new population $\mM_2$ of size $T_2$ by applying the mutation
to all sequences in $\mP_2$.

\subsubsection{Population Update}
Through crossover and mutation,
we obtain % a new population 
$\mI_2 = \mP_2 + \mC_2 + \mM_2$,
where $ |\mI_2| = % T_2 + \binom{T_2}{2} + T_2 =  
\frac{T_2(T_2+3)}{2}$.
From $\mI_2$, we select the $T_2$ sequences % from $\mS$ 
with the $T_2$ lowest cost functions of \eqref{eq:cost2}.
%according to the cost function in \eqref{eq:cost}.
%In other words, we choose $T$ index sets that have the lowest .
The population $\mP_2$ is then updated by the $T_2$ fittest sequences
at each evolution step. 

\subsubsection{Iteration and Selection}
In the second-stage GA, %the evolutionary steps of 
crossover, mutation, and population update
are repeated by a predefined number of iterations, denoted by $I_{\max, 2}$.
Finally, the fittest sequence of $\mP_2$, which has the lowest cost function of \eqref{eq:cost2},
will be selected as an optimized mask $\vbu_{\rm opt}$.

Algorithm 2 describes the entire steps of the second-stage GA
to optimize a masking sequence.
Finally, a set of non-orthogonal sequences, or $\Sbu = \Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$, 
is provided by our two-stage GA of Algorithms 1 and 2,
as illustrated by Fig.~\ref{fig:twoGA}.


\begin{rem}\label{rm:gen}
%	As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:twoGA},
	The set of non-orthogonal sequences designed by our two-stage GA
	can be represented by 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:set}
	\Sbu =  \Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} {\rm diag} (\vbu_{\rm opt}) 
	\cdot \Rbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}  \Ubu.
 	\end{equation}	
	Given a unitary matrix $\Ubu$, \eqref{eq:set} means that the matrix
	$\Sbu$ can be generated by the operations of row selection specified by $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ and
	masking by $\vbu_{\rm opt}$.
	Therefore, a BS receiver can generate the sequence set $\Sbu$ easily with 
	the highly structured unitary matrix $\Ubu$ by storing $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ and $\vbu_{\rm opt}$.
	Moreover, %if $\Ubu$ allows the fast unitary transform, 
	CS-based detection can be carried out fast and efficiently at BS, exploiting the fast unitary transform by $\Ubu$.  
	Also, each mMTC device is able to generate its unique sequence on-the-fly 
	with a unique column structure of $\Ubu$ by
	storing $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ and $\vbu_{\rm opt}$, % with a unique column of $\Ubu$, %respectively, 
	which allows its cheap and efficient implementation.

\section{Simulation Results}

In this section, 
%simulation results
%demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage GA to %optimize partial unitary matrices 
%obtain non-orthogonal sequences
%with low PAPR properties that can ultimately guarantee reliable CS-based detection 
%for uplink grant-free access.
%First of all, 
we first demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage GA for non-orthogonal sequence design.
%For this goal, we present the phase transitions of CS reconstruction performance 
%for several partial unitary matrices from the first-stage GA,
%and then examine the PAPR of the non-orthogonal sequences from the second-stage GA.
%with optimized subsampling index sets,
%Then, we examine the PAPR of the sequences obtained from the second-stage GA.
Then, we present simulation results of CS-based detection for uplink grant-free access,
%employing the non-orthogonal sequences designed by our two-stage GA.
which demonstrates the performance of non-orthogonal sequences designed by our two-stage GA.



For the unitary matrix $\Ubu$, % with $N=256$,
we use the $N \times N$ Fourier matrix $\Fbu = [F_{k,l}]$,
where
%each element is 
$F_{k,l} = e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi (k-1)(l-1)}{N}}$ 
for $1 \leq k, l \leq N$.
%while the Hadamard matrix $\Hbu$ is recursively generated.
Additionally, we consider another unitary matrix based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences~\cite{Chu:ZC}.
Each cyclic shift of the ZC sequence of even length %  $N=256$
becomes a column of a matrix $\Zbu = [Z_{k,l}]$,
where each element is given by
\[
Z_{k, l} = e^{\frac{-j \pi (k+N-l)^2}{N} }, \quad 1 \leq k, l \leq N.
\]
Due to the perfect auto-correlation~\cite{Chu:ZC} of ZC sequences,
it is clear that
$\Zbu$, called the ZC matrix, is also unitary.


Beginning with $\Fbu$ and $\Zbu$, 
our two-stage GA gives
$\Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$ and $\Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$, 
respectively, by Algorithms 1 and 2. %where the columns are
%the proposed non-orthogonal sequences.
Finally, their columns are
proposed as non-orthogonal sequences, called 
\emph{Fourier-based} and \emph{ZC-based}
sequences, respectively.

%Second, we use a binary $m$-sequence~\cite{GolGong:seq} of length $N-1=255$
%to define another unitary matrix $\Mbu = [M_{k,t}]$,
%where each element is % given by
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:mseq}
%	M_{k, t} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1, & \quad \mbox {if } k=1 \mbox{ or } t=1, \\  
%		a_{k-t}, & \quad \mbox{otherwise}, \end{array} \right. 
%\end{equation}
%for $1 \leq k, t \leq N$.
%In~\eqref{eq:mseq}, $(a_0, \cdots, a_{N-2})$ is a binary $m$-sequence taking $\pm 1$,
%%and $a_{k-t}$ is its cyclic shift, where 
%and the subscript $k-t$ is computed modulo $N-1$.
%Due to the ideal two-level auto-correlation~\cite{GolGong:seq} of the sequence,
%$\Mbu$ belongs to a class of the Hadamard matrices, called the Hadamard (m-seq) matrix in this paper.

\subsection{Effectiveness of Two-Stage GA}
In simulations, %we use $N \times N$ unitary matrices, where $N = 256$, and 
each stage GA has the population size of $T_1 = T_2 = 20$,
the crossover rate $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0.7$, and the mutation number $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = 1$, respectively.
%nd the evolutionary steps % of GA
%by $T = 20$ and $I_{\max}=500$, respectively. 
Algorithm 1 has $I_{\max, 1} = 500$,
whereas $I_{\max, 2} = 2000$ in Algorithm 2, as experiments showed that the cost function of Algorithm 2
converges slowly. % in experiments.
%experiments showed 
%the slower convergence of the cost function in Algorithm 2.
%$f_2(\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t}) $ from experiments.
Finally, the cost function of Algorithm 2 computes %computes
top $\delta = 30 \%$ average of PAPR of $\Pbu= \Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t} $
(or $\Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t} $)
for a mask sequence $\vbu_t$.

	\label{fig:cost_iter}
\end{figure}




Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_iter} displays the evolution of the cost functions \eqref{eq:cost} and \eqref{eq:cost2} of the fittest chromosomes,
respectively, from $M \times N$ partial Fourier and ZC matrices,
where $N=256$ and $M = 80$.
The figure shows that each stage GA continues to reduce its cost function over the evolution steps.
%to reach an optimized target.
%to minimize it.
As mentioned above, we observed that 
the cost function of Algorithm 2 % the second-stage GA 
converges slowly, 
compared to that of Algorithm 1. % the first-stage GA.
It is because the search space size for the optimization problem \eqref{eq:opt2} is $N^M$,
which is much larger than that of \eqref{eq:opt}, or $\binom{N}{M} \leq \left( \frac{eN}{M} \right)^M$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_iter} also reveals that the cost functions of partial Fourier and ZC matrices
converge to similar values,
%are higher than those of partial Hadamard matrices, 
which suggests that %the formers may exhibit more reliable performance of CS-based detection with lower PAPR properties.
their performance of CS reconstruction and PAPR property will be similar to each other.

To investigate the effectiveness of the first-stage GA,
we sketch the phase transition diagrams for 
%evaluate the performance of 
CS reconstruction with partial Fourier and ZC matrices, respectively,
%where $\Omega_{\rm opt}$ is a subsampling index set 
obtained by Algorithm 1. 
%by sketching the phase transitions.
We consider an MMV problem $\Ybu = \Abu \Xbu + \Wbu$,
where $ \Abu =  \Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$ (or $ \Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$),
$\Xbu = (\xbu_1, \cdots, \xbu_J)$ is a jointly sparse matrix 
with common nonzero rows, and 
$\Ybu = (\ybu_1, \cdots, \ybu_J)$ is a collection of $J=8$ measurement vectors. 
The nonzero entries of $\Xbu$ are independently drawn from $\mathcal{CN} (0, 1)$,
where their row positions are uniformly distributed.
Also, each element of $\Wbu$ is the i.i.d. Gaussian noise from $\mathcal{CN} (0, \sigma_n ^2)$,
where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to 
${\rm SNR} = \frac{\sum_{t=1} ^J|| \Abu \xbu_t ||_2 ^2}{J K M \sigma_n ^2} = 20$ dB.
%Also, $\nbu$ is the complex-valued Gaussian noise with each element drawn from $\mathcal{CN}(0, \sigma^2)$.
%Then, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to ${\rm SNR} = \frac{|| \Abu \xbu ||_2 ^2}{K M \sigma^2} = 20$ dB.
In phase transition, we made $10^4$ trials of CS reconstruction
at each test point,
where the step sizes of $\frac{M}{N}$ and $\frac{K}{M}$ are $2^{-5}$ and $10^{-2}$, respectively.
The phase transition
indicates that the corresponding CS reconstruction is successful with 
probability exceeding $99 \%$ below the transition curve, where
a success is declared % for CS reconstruction
if an estimated $\widehat{\Xbu}$
achieves $\frac{|| \Xbu - \widehat{\Xbu}||_F ^2}{|| \Xbu||_F ^2} < 10^{-2}$.



%Figs.~\ref{fig:Fr_ZC} and \ref{fig:Hd_mH} depict the phase transitions
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_mmv} depicts the phase transitions
%for $\Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$ and $\Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$, respectively,
for partial Fourier and ZC matrices 
under MMV reconstruction by
the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP)~\cite{Tropp:somp}, where 
the number of nonzero rows of $\Xbu$ is assumed to be known in advance.
In the figure, 
`GA (avg)' indicates the phase transition of $\Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$ (or $\Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}}$)
for which the cost function \eqref{eq:cost} has been minimized by Algorithm 1.
Meanwhile, `GA (coh)' corresponds to the case in which Algorithm 1 %optimizes the subsampling index sets 
changed its cost function with the mutual coherence, % of $\Ubu_\Omega$ 
%as the cost function, 
%the mutual coherence of $\Abu$,
i.e., $f_1(\Ubu_{\Omega_t}) %= \mu(\Abu) 
= \max_{ 1 \leq k \neq l \leq N  }
\frac{\left| \left \langle \abu_{k} ,  \abu_{l}  \right \rangle \right| }
{\| \abu_{k} \|_2 \| \abu_{l} \|_2}$, 
where $\abu_k$ and $\abu_l$ are the $k$th and the $l$th columns of $\Abu = \Ubu_{\Omega_t}$, respectively,
with $\Ubu = \Fbu$ or $\Zbu$.
Also, `random (coh)' and `random (avg)' show the phase transitions for
randomly subsampled Fourier (or ZC) matrices that %where the corresponding partial unitary matrices 
have the lowest coherence and the lowest cost function \eqref{eq:cost}, respectively,
out of $500$ trials.
%As a benchmark, we also sketch the phase transition for random Gaussian matrices.
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_mmv} shows that % for all tested partial unitary matrices,
the phase transition curves of `GA (avg)'
are higher than or equal to all the other ones over most compression ratios,
which demonstrates that the partial Fourier and ZC matrices optimized by Algorithm 1 
with the cost function \eqref{eq:cost}
present reliable MMV reconstruction %than with the other ones 
over a wide range of compression $\left( \frac{M}{N} \right)$ and sparsity $\left( \frac{K}{M} \right)$ ratios.

The effectiveness of the second-stage GA is verified by 
Fig.~\ref{fig:all_papr}, which sketches the maximum and top $ 30 \%$ average PAPR of the sequences
obtained by Algorithm 2. % from various partial unitary matrices.
In the figure, `avg' means that Algorithm 2 utilized

while `max' indicates that the maximum PAPR of $\Ubu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_t}$
has been used as the cost function of Algorithm 2, where $\Ubu = \Fbu$ or $\Zbu$.

\subsection{Performance of CS-based Detection}

Numerical experiments examine the performance of the proposed non-orthogonal sequences
for CS-based AUD and CE in uplink grant-free access.
Under the system model of Section II,
we assume that there are $N = 500$ devices in an mMTC cell,
where each one is assigned a unique non-orthogonal pilot sequence of length $M=80$. % for uplink grant-free access.
%Each active device sends its pilot for access attempt.
Reflecting sparse activity, each device sends its pilot with probability $p_a=0.1$
at each access time.
At BS, 
the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per device is set to 
${\rm SNR} = \frac{1}{K} \cdot \frac{\sum_{t=1} ^J|| \Sbu \xbu^{(t)} ||_2 ^2}{J M \sigma_n ^2}$.



For CS-based AUD and CE, % joint activity detection and channel estimation,
a BS receiver deploys the SOMP algorithm that requires
no prior knowledge of the number of active devices\footnote{
%With no prior knowledge of the number of active devices, 
In simulations, this sparsity-blind SOMP stops its iteration empirically %  in simulations,
if the maximum signal proxy is less than $\sqrt{3\sigma_n ^2 J}$.}.
In AUD, both undetected and false-alarmed devices
are treated as errors.
Thus, the activity error rate (AER) is defined by the average of 
$\frac{|\mS \setminus \widehat{\mS} | + |\widehat{\mS} \setminus \mS  |}{|\mS \cup \widehat{\mS}|}$,
where $\mS$ and $\widehat{\mS}$ are true and detected sets of active devices, respectively.
Also, channel estimation errors are measured by the normalized 
mean squared errors (NMSE), or the average of
$\frac{|| \hbu_\mS - \widehat{\hbu}_{\mS} ||_2 ^2}{|| \hbu_\mS ||_2 ^2}$,
where $\hbu_\mS$ and $ \widehat{\hbu}_{\mS}$ are true and estimated channel vectors,
respectively, for truly active devices.
%To evaluate the performance of CS-based AUD and CE, 
In simulations, the averages for AER and NMSE are computed over $10^4$ access trials.




%In performance evaluation, we consider the %examine the AER and NMSE for the % proposed  %optimized by our two-stage GA.
To obtain the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences %designed by our two-stage GA
from 
$\Fbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$ and 
$\Zbu_{\Omega_{\rm opt}, \vbu_{\rm opt}}$, 
respectively,
Algorithms 1 and 2 use the same parameters as in Section V.A, but $I_{\max, 1} = 1000$ and $I_{\max, 2} = 4000$.
For comparison, 
%other non-orthogonal sequences 
%are also tested. % in performance evaluation.
%First of all, 
we generate complex-valued random Gaussian sequences of length $M$, 
where each element is drawn from the i.i.d. complex Gaussian distribution 
with zero mean and variance $1/M$~\cite{Liu:mimo}.
Also, we use the complex-valued MUSA spreading sequences of length $M$,
where each element is randomly taken from the 3-level signal constellation, i.e.,
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} [{\pm 1} {\pm j} , \pm 1, \pm j, 0]$, in Fig.~2(b) of~\cite{Yuan:MUSA}.
Generating $N$ random Gaussian and $N$ %3-level 
MUSA sequences, we have
$M \times N$ matrices $\Gbu$ and $\Mbu$, respectively, 
where each one is a matrix with the lowest coherence 
among $1000$ trials.
%For each of the two random sequence sets, 


The last sequence set for comparison 
is obtained by cyclic shifts of the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences with multiple roots,
where the sequence length $M_{\rm ZC}=79$ is a prime number closest to $M$.
In specific, we begin with an 
$M_{\rm ZC} \times M_{\rm ZC}$ matrix $\Cbu_u$

\subsection{Discussion}
The simulation results of this section demonstrated that the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences
designed by our two-stage GA outperform complex-valued random Gaussian and MUSA sequences
for CS-based AUD and CE. % in uplink grant-free access.
Also, we observed that the performance of the proposed sequences is similar to that of   
the ZC sequences of prime lengths. 

In comparison to the ZC sequences, we would like to point out other potential
benefits of the proposed sequences.
First, the non-orthogonal sequences from our two-stage GA
have no limit to the granularity of sequence length, % inherited from arbitrary row selection of a unitary matrix,

Meanwhile, the length of the ZC sequences should be odd prime only,
which is less flexible for managing resource subcarriers. % in sequence length.
Being able to take arbitrary sequence lengths,
the proposed sequences are expected to
facilitate mMTC systems to manage the resources more effectively for grant-free access.

Second, the proposed sequences constitute a partial unitary matrix with a column mask
through arbitrary row selection,
whereas the ZC sequences of prime length form a deterministic matrix with low coherence.
%As a \emph{structured} random matrix~\cite{Duarte:struct}, 
While the coherence-based recovery guarantee of the deterministic matrix

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has presented
a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) to design new non-orthogonal sequences
%for guaranteeing reliable performance for CS-based detection 
for uplink grant-free access in mMTC. %massive connectivity,
The first-stage GA is to find a subsampling index set 
for a partial unitary matrix that can be approximated to an ETF.
%approximate the optimized matrix to ETF.
%The cost function of GA is defined by the Frobenius norm of the upper triangular part of $\Abu^H \Abu - \Wbu $
%above the diagonal,
%where the off-diagonal entries of $\Wbu$ are the Welch bound equality (WBE).
The second-stage GA then tries to find a masking sequence to be commonly applied  
to each column of the partial unitary matrix from the first-stage,
in order to enhance the PAPR property of the resulting columns.
In each stage GA, a new cost function has been elaborately proposed 
to improve the optimized result.
Finally, the masked columns of the partial unitary matrix
are proposed as new non-orthogonal sequences for uplink grant-free access.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to apply the GA technique
to non-orthogonal sequence design for achieving low correlation 
and low PAPR properties simultaneously.


Simulation results demonstrated that the
partial Fourier and ZC matrices optimized by our first-stage GA guarantee reliable CS reconstruction
% than randomly subsampled unitary matrices
over a wide range of compression and sparsity ratios.
Also, we observed that the second-stage GA produces
the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences that have acceptable PAPR distributions
for multicarrier transmission.
Finally, we demonstrated that %the proposed sequences %obtained by our two-stage GA 
%outperform some random sequences 
%in CS-based AUD and CE for uplink grant-free access.
%While their detection performance is similar to that of the ZC sequences of prime lengths,
the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences exhibit reliable performance of CS-based AUD and CE in uplink grant-free access,
which can be suitable for massive connectivity.
%taking arbitrary sequence length
%and guaranteeing the performance theoretically and numerically.

The main benefits of this GA-based design are summarized as follows.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$] The non-orthogonal sequences obtained by this GA-based design
	present theoretical recovery guarantee for CS reconstruction by 
	forming a partial unitary matrix through arbitrary row selection.  
	Simulation results confirmed that the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences from this design
	show excellent performance
	of CS-based AUD and CE in uplink grant-free access. %, comparable to algebraically designed ZC sequences of prime lengths.  
%	The two-stage GA presents a new set of non-orthogonal sequences for massive connectivity. 
%	To the best of our knowledge, it is the first effort to apply the GA technique
%	to non-orthogonal sequence design for achieving low correlation 
%	and low PAPR simultaneously.
%	Numerical results demonstrated that the non-orthogonal sequences exhibit acceptable PAPR property
%	and guarantee reliable CS-based detection for uplink grant-free access.
	\item[$\bullet$] This GA-based design is able to generate non-orthogonal sequences of arbitrary length,
	which can be a good choice for sequence lengths for which algebraically designed sequences with low correlation are unknown.
	In practice, the sequences of arbitrary length can be useful
	for mMTC systems to manage the resources effectively.
	\item[$\bullet$] Based on unitary matrices, this GA-based design
	can offer unimodular sequences of finite phase with rich structure, which 
	%Compared to other algorithmic and DL-based designs, 
%	The sequences with such structure
	are suitable for cost efficient implementation in mMTC devices.	
%	\item[$\bullet$] The two-stage GA can reach a good solution 
%	of a subsampling index set and a masking sequence. Applied to unitary matrices of high dimension, 
%	the solution can yield a relatively large number of sequences. %, although the solution may not be a global optimum.
%	Meanwhile, the number of sequences generated by a DL-based design 
%	may be limited in general, since all the sequence elements need to be obtained through training. 
%	Therefore, this GA-based design can provide a larger number of non-orthogonal sequences than DL-based ones,
%	to support highly overloaded mMTC devices. 	 
\end{itemize}
 
 
While this GA-based design successfully presented new 
non-orthogonal sequences  
%of arbitrary length that
%exhibits acceptable PAPR distribution and 
%guarantees reliable CS-based detection,
%that can be suitable 
for grant-free massive connectivity,
a further study will be necessary to enhance the design method.
First, the PAPR of the Fourier- and ZC-based sequences, although improved through evolution,
still needs to be reduced further.
It will be challenging, but necessary to devise 
a more elaborate method for further PAPR reduction
so that the PAPR distribution of the resulting sequences can be as good as that of the ZC sequences of prime lengths.
Second, this GA-based design using the Fourier or ZC matrices increases the number of phases of 
sequence elements as more sequences are required to support more mMTC devices.
To resolve this issue, we have employed the Hadamard matrices for our two-stage GA,
but found that the performance of CS-based detection is worse than that of Fourier or ZC matrices.
To obtain sequences of small phase,
we may need to study further with another unitary matrix 
of high dimension but with each element of smaller phase. 
Third, the proposed non-orthogonal sequences are for a single-cell massive connectivity,
but a further study will be necessary for this GA-based design % so that it can 
to provide multiple sets of non-orthogonal sequences 
for multi-cell environments.
Finally, %we may study a DL-based sequence design 
our two-stage GA can be considered 
as a component of DL-based sequence design, 
%for the state-of-the-art DL techniques 
%e.g., DL-based design, % replacing the CS-based detector,
%to design new non-orthogonal sequences, % provides the reference data sets, 
which is our ongoing research work.
