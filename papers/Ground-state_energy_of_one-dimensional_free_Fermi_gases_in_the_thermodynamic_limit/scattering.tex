General results from scattering theory show that the operator $\hat\Omega^\pm(\nu)$ in \eqref{Omega_matrix} 
is related to the scattering matrix (see e.g. \cite[ Thm. 4]{BirmanEntina1967}).
Here, we give an elementary derivation.
To this end, we provide some scattering theoretic background for the one-dimensional
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}\label{st01}
  -\psi''(x) + V(x)\psi(x) = k^2 \psi(x),\ \im(k) \geq 0,
\end{equation}
both on the line and on the half-line.
We write $k^2$ instead of $z$ to stay closer to the usual notation in scattering theory.
For scattering on the line see, e.g., \cite[Sec. 2, \S 3, in particular pp. 145, 146]{DeiftTrubowitz1979}
and on the half-line see \cite[Ch. 4]{Yafaev2010}.
