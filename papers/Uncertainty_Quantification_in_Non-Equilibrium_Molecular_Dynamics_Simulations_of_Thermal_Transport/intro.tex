Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is commonly used to study thermal transport by means of
phonons in material systems comprising non-metallic elements such
as carbon, silicon, and germanium~\cite{Dumitrica:2010}. 
A major objective for many such studies is the
estimation of bulk thermal conductivity of the system. One of the most commonly used approaches,
regarded as the direct method~\cite{Schelling:2002,Turney:2009,Zhou:2009,Landry:2009,
McGaughey:2006,Ni:2009,Shi:2009,Wang:2009,Papanikolaou:2008}, is a non-equilibrium
technique that involves the application
of a heat flux or a temperature gradient by means of thermostatting, across the system. 
The corresponding steady-state temperature gradient in the former or the heat exchange between
the two thermostats in the latter, is used to estimate the bulk thermal conductivity (at a given
length or size) using 
Fourier's law. However, when the simulation domain is comparable to or smaller than the
mean free path, thermal conductivity estimates from the direct method depends on the
distance between the two thermostats, due to significant contribution of boundary scattering.
Hence, to estimate the bulk thermal conductivity, computations are performed for a range of
system lengths and the inverse
of thermal conductivity is plotted against the inverse of length. The $y$-intercept of a
straight line fit to the observed trend is considered as the bulk thermal conductivity 
estimate. 

Although widely used, the direct method is known to severely under-predict
the bulk thermal conductivity compared to experimental 
measurements~\cite{Haynes:2014,Shanks:1963}. This is primarily
due to length scales used in the simulation that are several orders of magnitude smaller
than those used in an experiment. As a result, the sample length is much smaller than the
bulk phonon mean free path leading to the so-called ballistic transport of the phonons.
The mean free path of such phonon modes is limited to the system size that reduces their
contribution to thermal transport. Moreover, the
introduction of thermostats typically reduces the correlation between vibrations of 
different atoms potentially reducing the thermal conductivity
further~\cite{Evans:2008}. The average temperature gradient experienced by the 
system could thus be different from the simulation input and is a potential source of 
uncertainty. Estimation of thermal conductivity using the
direct method is therefore impacted by the choice of system size and potentially due to
fluctuations in the temperature gradient experienced by the system due to thermostatting.  

Predictions of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are also dependent on the
choice of the inter-atomic potential as well as values associated with individual parameters
of a given potential. For instance, in the case of crystalline Si, the Stillinger-Weber (SW)
inter-atomic potential is widely used. However, as discussed by Stillinger and Weber
in~\cite{Stillinger:1985}, their proposed nominal values of individual parameters were based
on a limited search in a 7D parameter space while ensuring structural stability and
reasonable agreement with experiments. It is therefore likely that these nominal estimates
for individual parameter values in the SW potential may not yield accurate results for a
wide variety of Si-based systems and warrant further investigation to study the impact of
underlying uncertainties on MD predictions. Along these lines, 
a recent study by Wang et al. performed uncertainty quantification of thermal conductivities
from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations~\cite{Wang:2017}.
Rizzi et al. focused on the effect of
uncertainties associated with the force-field parameters on bulk water properties using MD
simulations~\cite{Rizzi:2012}. Marepalli et al. in~\cite{Marepalli:2014} considered a stochastic model
for thermal conductivity to account for inherent noise in MD simulations, and study its impact on
spatial temperature 
distribution during heat conduction. Jacobson et al. in~\cite{Jacobson:2014} implemented an uncertainty
quantification framework to optimize a coarse-grained model for predicting the properties of monoatomic
 water. While these are significant contributions, it is only recently 
that researchers have started accounting for the presence of uncertainties in MD predictions in a
systematic manner. There is a definite need for additional efforts aimed at efficiency and accuracy
to enable uncertainty analysis in MD simulations for a wide range of applications.

In the present work, we focus our efforts on uncertainty analysis in the predictions of NEMD simulations
for phonon transport using a silicon bar. An overview of the set-up for the simulations is
provided in Section~\ref{sec:setup}. As discussed earlier, predictions from NEMD
exhibit large discrepancies with experimental observations depending upon system size and potentially
due to fluctuations in the applied temperature gradient. Additionally, the thermal conductivity estimates are
tightly coupled with parameter values associated with the inter-atomic potential. Hence, we set out to
accomplish multiple objectives through this research effort: First, we construct response surfaces
in order to characterize the dependence of discrepancy in thermal conductivity estimates (between
MD simulations and experiments) on system size, and applied temperature gradient~(Section~\ref{sec:response}).
Second, we perform sensitivity analysis to study the impact of SW potential parameter values on 
uncertainty in the predictions~(Section~\ref{sec:sense}).
Third, we exploit our findings from sensitivity analysis to 
construct a reduced order surrogate for uncertainty analysis~(Section~\ref{sec:ros}). 
Fourth, we illustrate the calibration
of important parameters in a Bayesian setting to evaluate their posterior
distributions~(Section~\ref{sec:bayes}). Construction of the
response surfaces, parametric sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian calibration can all be computationally
challenging endeavors especially in situations involving compute-intensive simulations as in the
case of NEMD. We therefore employ polynomial chaos (PC) surrogates~\cite{Xiu:2002,Ghanem:1990}
using non-intrusive spectral approaches~\cite{Olivier:2010} to reduce the computational effort pertaining
to the aforementioned objectives. Moreover, since the construction of a PC surrogate itself can be
expensive, we demonstrate a novel approach in Section~\ref{sec:sense} that implements derivative-based
sensitivity measures~\cite{Sobol:2010} to reduce the dimensionality of the surrogate a priori while
ensuring reasonable predictive accuracy.
