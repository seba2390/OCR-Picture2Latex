In Section \ref{sec:model} we define our model. 
In Sections \ref{sec:prophet_random}  and \ref{sec:prophet_lex} we present our results with respect to the
random tie-breaking rule, and the ranked tie-breaking rule, respectively.
We conclude the paper in Section \ref{sec:future} with future directions.
