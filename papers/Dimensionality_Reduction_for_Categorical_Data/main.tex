% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
 \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
\usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
 \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
\let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
\renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted

% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
Categorical attributes are those that can take a discrete set of values, e.g., colours. This work is about compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors. The current hash-based methods compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors do not provide any guarantee on the Hamming distances between the compressed representations. Here we present \fsketch to create sketches for sparse categorical data and an estimator to estimate the pairwise Hamming distances among the uncompressed data only from their sketches. We claim that these sketches can be used in the usual data mining tasks in place of the original data without compromising the quality of the task. For that, we ensure that the sketches also are categorical, sparse, and the Hamming distance estimates are reasonably precise. Both the sketch construction and the Hamming distance estimation algorithms require just a single-pass; furthermore, changes to a data point can be incorporated into its sketch in an efficient manner. The compressibility depends upon how sparse the data is and is independent of the original dimension -- making our algorithm attractive for many real-life scenarios. Our claims are backed by rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of \fsketch and supplemented by extensive comparative evaluations with related algorithms on some real-world datasets. We show that \fsketch is significantly faster, and the accuracy obtained by using its sketches are among the top for the standard unsupervised tasks of $\mathrm{RMSE}$, clustering and similarity search.
