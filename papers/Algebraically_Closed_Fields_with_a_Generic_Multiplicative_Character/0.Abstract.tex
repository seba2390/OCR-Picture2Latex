\noindent We study the model theory of the $2$-sorted structure $(\mathbb{F}, \mathbb{C};\chi)$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is an algebraic closure of a finite field of characteristic $p$, $\mathbb{C}$ is the field of complex numbers and $\chi: \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{C}$ is an injective, multiplication preserving map. We obtain an axiomatization $\mathrm{ACFC}_p$ of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{F},\mathbb{C};\chi)$ in a suitable language $L$, classify the models of $\mathrm{ACFC}_p$ up to isomorphism, prove a modified model companion result, give various descriptions of definable sets inside a model of $\mathrm{ACFC}_p$, and deduce that $\mathrm{ACFC}_p$ is $\omega$-stable and has definability of Morley rank in families.

\begin{comment}
We study the class $\mathcal{C}$ of two sorted structures $(F,K;\chi)$, where $F$ and $K$ are algebraically closed fields, $K$ has characteristic 0, and $\chi:F\to K$ is a generic multiplicative character which means $\chi$ is injective, multiplication preserving, takes multiplicatively independent elements to algebraically independent elements over $\qq$.
The example of main interest is $(\fpa,\qa;\chi)$ where $\chi$ is an injective and multiplication preserving. 
We obtain the following results: $\mathcal{C}$ is an elementary class with axiomatization denoted by $\TN$;
for \(p\) prime or \(p=0\), $\TNp:=\TN\cup \{\text{char}(F)=p\}$ has a categoricity property, is complete, has various characterizations of substructures and elementary substructures,
has relative quantifier elimination, is $\omega$-stable, has all models algebraically bounded, has all definable functions piecewise closed-graph in a natural topology based on relative quantifier elimination.




We study the class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures $(F,K;\chi)$'s, where $F$ and $K$ are algebraically closed fields, $K$ has characteristic 0, and $\chi:F\to K$ is a generic multiplicative character map which means $\chi$ is an injective, multiplication preserving map taking multiplicatively independent elements to algebraically independent elements over $\qq$.
The example of main interest is $(\fpa,\qa;\chi)$ where $\chi$ is an injective and multiplication preserving. We prove that $\mathcal{C}$ is a elementary class which admits a recursive $\forall\exists$-axiomatization, which we will call $\TN$. For \(p\) prime or \(p=0\), let $\TNp=\TN\cup \{\text{char}(F)=p\}$; we prove for all cardinals \( \kappa, \lambda\) possibly finite, up to isomorphism, there is a unique model \( (F, K; \chi) \)'s of \(\TNp \) where \( \text{trdeg}F\slash F_p = \kappa\) and \( \text{trdeg}K\slash \qq(\chi(F))= \lambda\).  Furthermore, we prove relative quantifier elimination, and as applications of it we get $\omega$-stability, algebraic boundedness.
We introduce two possible topologies. Then we characterize all definable functions using certain closed functions. More precisely, every definable function is a piece-wise definable functions with closed graphs.
