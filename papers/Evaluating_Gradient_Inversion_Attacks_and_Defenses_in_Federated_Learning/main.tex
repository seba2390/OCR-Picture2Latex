% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~x.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
