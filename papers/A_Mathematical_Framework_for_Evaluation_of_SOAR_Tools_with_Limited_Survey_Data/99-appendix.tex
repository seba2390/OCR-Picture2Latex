The survey was delivered electronically and included 4 pre-survey questions, 10 questions about the specific tools (including their aspects), and 1 question about the overall ranking. All ratings questions were scored 1-5, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. On the two ranking questions, the operators ranked their most preferred aspect/tool as 1 and their least preferred as the highest value.}
