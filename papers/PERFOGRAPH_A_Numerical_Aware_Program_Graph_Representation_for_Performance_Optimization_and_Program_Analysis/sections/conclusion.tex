In this paper, we presented \ourtool, an LLVM IR-based graph representation of programs that supports aggregate data types such as arrays and vectors and is numerical aware. Moreover, it addresses several limitations of the previous IR-based graph representations.
\ourtool is evaluated on various downstream tasks, and experimental results indicate that \ourtool is indeed effective, outperforming state-of-the-art in most of the downstream tasks.
% Due to its numerical awareness, \ourtool typically brings more benefits to downstream tasks related to performance optimization. 
% For instance, for the device mapping problem, \ourtool outperforms all the baselines.
% It could outperform even the pre-trained embedding models such as IR2Vec.
\ourtool numerical awareness capability is limited to the numerical values that are available at the compile time.
For future work, we intend to augment our representation by adding support for dynamic information and checking the possibility of integrating hardware performance counters with our representation. Moreover, we plan to develop a pre-trained embedding model using our representation. Having a pre-trained model will help to solve the problem of limited training samples in some downstream tasks.
