\section{Empirical study}
\label{sec:exp}


As part of our program, we perform empirical evaluations over our algorithms developed for partially dynamic LSR, over both synthetic and real-world datasets. 
Our method is most suitable for input data that are non-uniform. 
Indeed, if the data has low coherence (they are all similar to each other), then the naive uniform sampling is already as good as leverage score sampling. 


\vspace{+2mm}
{\noindent \bf Synthetic dataset \ \ } We follow the empirical study of \cite{dl19} and generate data from the {\em elliptical model}. In this model $\ba^{(t)} = w^{(t)}\Sigma \bz^{(t)}$, where $\bz^{(t)} \sim N(0, \bI_d)$ is a random Gaussian vector, $\Sigma \in \R^{d\times d}$ is a PSD matrix, and $w^{(t)}$ is a scalar. The label is generated as $b^{(t)} = \langle \ba^{(t)}, \bx^{\star}\rangle + w^{(t)}\xi^{(t)}$, where $\bx^{\star} \in \R^{d}$ is a hidden vector and $\xi \sim N(0,1)$ is standard Gaussian noise. This model has a long history in multivariate statistics, see e.g.~\cite{martin1979multivariate}. 
In our experiments, we set $\Sigma = \bI_d$ for simplicity. 
In order to make the dataset non-uniform, after the initial phase (the first 10\% of the data), we randomly choose $d/10$ rows among the next 10\% of data to have a large scalar of $\sqrt{T}$. The rest of the data have a scalar of $1$. 
We set $T = 500000$ and $d = 500$.

{\noindent \bf Real-world dataset \ \ } We use the VirusShare dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository\footnote{\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php}}. We select this dataset because it has a large number of features and data points, and has low errors when fitted by a linear model. 
The dataset is collected from Nov 2010 to Jul 2014 by VirusShare (an online platform for malware detection).
It has $T = 177856$ data points and $d = 482$ features.


\vspace{+2mm}
{\noindent \bf Baseline algorithms \ \ } We compare with three baseline methods. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Kalman's approach} makes use of the Woodbury identity and gives an exact solution. 
\item The {\em uniform sampling} approach samples new rows uniformly at random. 
\item The {\em row sampling} approach samples new rows according to the exact online leverage scores \cite{cmp20}.
\end{enumerate}


\vspace{+2mm}
{\noindent \bf Parameters \ \ } In both our method and the row sampling method, we use an error parameter $\epsilon$. We set the sampling probability to be $p = \min\{\tau \epsilon^{-2} / 2, 1\}$ (except when $\epsilon=1$ we set $p = \min\{\tau, 1\}$ to make it non-trivial), where $\tau$ is the approximate online leverage score of different methods. 
We only implement our oblivious algorithm since both datasets do not involve adaptive adversary.
The JL matrix in our algorithm has $k$ number of rows, where we set $k = c_{\epsilon} \cdot \epsilon^{-2}$ for some constants $c_{\epsilon}$ so that $k \approx 20$.  The raw data of our experiments are shown in Table~\ref{tab:experiment}.

\caption{Experiment results. The $x$-axis shows the running time (unit: seconds), and the $y$-axis shows the relative error $(\mathrm{err}/\mathrm{err}_{\mathrm{std}} - 1)$, where $\mathrm{err}$ is the error of the particular approach, and $\mathrm{err}_{\mathrm{std}}$ is the error of the static Normal equation. 
The $y$-axis is on a symlog scale, where for range $\geq 0.005$ we show the base-$10$ log scale, and for range $[0, 0.005)$ we show the linear scale. Kalman's approach has a relative error of $0$, and except this point, all other data points are in the range of the log scale. 
For uniform sampling, we take sampling probability $p=0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5$. For row sampling and our algorithm, we take the error parameter $\eps = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1$. }

{\noindent \bf Experiment results \ \ }
Our experiments are executed on an Apple M1 CPU with codes written in MATLAB. We repeat all experiments for at least $5$ times and take the mean. 
On both datasets, we initiate the model based on the first 10\% of the data.
The experiment results are formally presented in Figure \ref{fig:exp1}.
Our algorithm consistently outperforms baseline methods: It runs faster when achieving comparable error rates.
