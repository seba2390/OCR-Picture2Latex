\section{Conclusion}

We studied the phenomenon of near persistence of the local LP relaxation on instances of MAP inference in ferromagnetic Potts model. We gave theoretical results, algorithms (for finding nearby stable instances) and empirical results to demonstrate that even after a $(2,1,\psi)$-perturbation stable instance is corrupted with noise, the solution to the LP relaxation is nearly persistent i.e., it approximately recovers the MAP solution.  Our theoretical results imply that the local LP approximately recovers the MAP solution when the observed instance is close to a stable instance. Our empirical results suggest that real-world instances are very close to stable instances. These results together suggest a new explanation for the near-persistency of the solution of the local LP relaxation for MAP inference in practice.
