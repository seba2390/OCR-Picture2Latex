\caption{\textbf{Sharing image-region and word representations across multiple vision-language domains:} The SVLR module projects images and words into a shared representation space. The resulting visual and textual embeddings are then used for tasks like Visual Recognition and VQA. The models for individual tasks are formulated in terms of inner products of region and word representations enforcing an alignment between them in the shared space.}
