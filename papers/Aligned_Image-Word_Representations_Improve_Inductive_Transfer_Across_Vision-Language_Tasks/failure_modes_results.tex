  \caption{\textbf{Failure modes:} Our model cannot count or read, though it will still identify the relevant regions. It is blind to relations and thus fails to recognize that \textit{birds}, while present, are not \textit{drinking water}. The model may give a low score to the correct answer despite accurate visual recognition. For instance, the model observes \textit{asphalt} but predicts \textit{concrete}, likely due to language bias. A clear example of an error due to language bias is in the top-left image as it believes the lady is holding a \textit{baby} rather than a \textit{dog}, even though visual recognition confirms evidence for dog. Finally, our model fails to answer questions that require complex reasoning comparing multiple regions.}
