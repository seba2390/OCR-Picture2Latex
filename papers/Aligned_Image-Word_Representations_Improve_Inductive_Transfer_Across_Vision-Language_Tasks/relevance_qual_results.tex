  \caption{\textbf{Interpretable inference in VQA:} Our model produces interpretable intermediate computation for region relevance and object/attribute predictions for the most relevant regions. Our region relevance explicitly grounds nouns and adjectives from the Q/A input in the image. We also show object and attribute predictions for the most relevant region identified for a few correctly answered questions. The relevance masks are generated from relevance scores projected back to their source pixels locations.}
