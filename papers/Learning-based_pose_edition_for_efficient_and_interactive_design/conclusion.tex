%suggestion : We propose a neural networks method that provides an interactive and efficient tool to generate a natural and realistic posture/pose of a character's skeleton.
We propose a method leveraging neural networks to provide an interactive and efficient tool to pose a character's skeleton. Learning from a large dataset of ground truth poses allows us to avoid manually specifying the complex constraints of the human skeleton, and only generating plausible poses.
% In addition (Furthermore our method shits ...
Our approach also shifts a large part of the algorithmic burden of traditional methods to the training phase, allowing it to run competitively fast once set up. Compared to previous data-driven pose edition methods, our method takes up a small amount of memory, freeing up resources for other processes. We provide examples of integration of our method in a prototype posing software, as well as a way to switch to multiple targets configurations.
%ce serait bien si tu soulignes une limitation de la méthode : même pour dire que pour le moment elle est es limité à telle ou telle morphologie ou transformation avant de passer aux travaux futurs
Future work on the subject will focus on extending the method to more use cases: using the method for other, non standardized skeletons (with a different morphology or non-humanoid) and adding joint rotations to the solver's input and output.
