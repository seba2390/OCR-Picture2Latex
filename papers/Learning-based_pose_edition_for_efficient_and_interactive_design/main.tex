\begin{abstract}
Authoring an appealing animation for a virtual character is a challenging task. In computer-aided keyframe animation artists define the key poses of a character by manipulating its underlying skeletons.
To look plausible, a character pose must respect many ill-defined constraints, and so the resulting realism greatly depends on the animator's skill and knowledge.
Animation software provide tools to help in this matter, relying on various algorithms to automatically enforce some of these constraints.
The increasing availability of motion capture data has raised interest in data-driven approaches to pose design, with the potential of shifting more of the task of assessing realism from the artist to the computer, and to provide easier access to non-experts. In this paper, we propose such a method, relying on neural networks to automatically learn the constraints from the data. We describe an efficient tool for pose design, allowing naïve users to intuitively manipulate a pose to create character animations.

\section{Introduction}
Character animation is an essential part of computer-generated imagery industries such as feature films, cartoons or video games which make use of on-screen characters to tell stories, convey emotions and appeal to their audiences.
These characters are represented by 3-dimensional meshes whose motion is driven by an underlying skeleton. A common method to design and edit animations is keyframing: animator pose the character at desired time stamps (the key frames) and the computer interpolates between them to fill in the gaps.
Most animation software such as Blender or Maya provide interactive tools allowing users to pose a character by manipulating its underlying skeleton.
We propose an innovative solution that makes the pose editing process more affordable without compromising the quality of the results. The presented method leverages neural networks to implicitly learn the intricacies of a (human) skeleton and provide simple controls.
Our main goal is to create an intuitive real-time system that can produce appealing poses even for a novice user.

%Simple description of the method
Our framework relies on a few small networks requiring reasonable resources to train, with the added advantage of running quite fast at inference time. The core of our approach is an encoder-decoder trained on skeleton pose data, the task of which is to build a latent representation of the pose space, alleviating some of the limitations of the former. We then train a family of solver networks to work on this latent space in order to generate a pose satisfying user-defined target positions.
