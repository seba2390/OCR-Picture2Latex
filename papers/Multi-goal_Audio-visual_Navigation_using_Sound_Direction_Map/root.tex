%% Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

%% \section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

%% The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

%% References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
