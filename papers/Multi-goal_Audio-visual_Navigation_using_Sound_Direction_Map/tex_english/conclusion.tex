\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{CONCLUSION}

In this paper, we proposed a new framework \textit{multi-goal audio-visual navigation}, in which multiple sound sources serve as goals. We investigated the effect of increasing the number of goals on navigation performance.
The results showed that increasing the number of goals tends to cause large performance degradation.
In particular, we found that navigation became difficult when there is a loud or long sound.
Subsequent difficulty investigations implied the importance of sound source separation and also suggested the importance of effective use of memory.

We also proposed a method for solving the multi-goal audio-visual navigation task with higher accuracy, sound direction map (SDM).
The SDM takes advantage of memory to dynamically localize multiple sound sources.
Experiments showed that the SDM is useful for all the numbers of goals and all baselines.
Qualitative results also demonstrated that the SDM successfully decreased the number of unnecessary actions.
