\begin{abstract}
Using contiguous relations we construct an infinite number of   
continued fraction expansions for ratios of generalized 
hypergeometric series ${}_3F_2(1)$. 
We establish exact error term estimates for their approximants 
and prove their rapid convergences.    
To do so we develop a discrete version of Laplace's method for hypergeometric 
series in addition to the use of ordinary (continuous) Laplace's method for 
Euler's hypergeometric integrals.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In 1813 Gauss \cite{Gauss} introduced a general continued fraction that represents  
the ratio of two ${}_2F_1$ hypergeometric functions. 
It is interesting because it contains a variety of continued fraction expansions of 
several important elementary functions and some of more transcendental ones.   
In 1901 Van Vleck \cite{VanVleck} established a general result on its convergence.   
Gauss's continued fraction is derived from a three-term contiguous relation for 
${}_2F_1$. 
In 1956, using other contiguous relations, Frank \cite{Frank} constructed some 
more (eight or so) continued fractions of a similar sort and discussed their 
convergence.  
In 2005 Borwein, Choi and Pigulla \cite{BCP} obtained an explicit bound for 
the error term in certain special cases of the Gauss continued fraction.   
In 2011, based on Gauss's continued fraction and other means, Colman, Cuyt 
and Van Deun \cite{CCD} developed an efficient algorithm for the validated 
high-precision computation of certain ${}_2F_1$ functions.    
%%%%%
\par
%%%%% 
The generalized hypergeometric series of 
unit argument ${}_3F_2(1)$ also admits three-term contiguous relations, 
among which the  basic twelve relations were found by Wilson \cite{Wilson};  
see also Bailey \cite{Bailey2}.   
Thus it is feasible and interesting to discuss or utilize allied continued fractions 
for ${}_3F_2(1)$. 
For instance, Zhang \cite{Zhang} used contiguous relations for ${}_3F_2(1)$ 
to give new proofs of three of Ramanujan's elegant continued fractions for products 
and quotients of gamma functions, namely, entries 34, 36 and 39 in 
Ramanujan's second notebook \cite[Chapter 12]{Ramanujan}, or in its 
corrected version by Berndt, Lamphere and Wilson \cite{BLW}.    
In a similar vein, Denis and Singh \cite{DS}  dealt with entries 25 and 33 
of the same notebook.   
%%%%%
\par
%%%%% 
To give a further motivation for ${}_3F_2(1)$ continued fractions, we look 
at the special case in which one of the numerator parameters, say $a_0$, 
is equal to one:

This class of infinite sums are interesting because they contain a lot of 
special evaluations, some of which are presented in Table \ref{tab:3F2-i}.  
Therefore it is important to establish a general framework for the 
precise and efficient computations of the series \eqref{eqn:3F2-i}. 
Naturally, our approach here is based on three-term contiguous 
relations and allied continued fractions. 
As an illustration of a more general story to be developed in this 
article, we shall present a continued fraction expansion of the 
series \eqref{eqn:3F2-i} with an exact error term estimate 
for its approximants that exhibits an exponentially fast convergence 
(see Theorem \ref{thm:ete-i}).

The modulo $3$ structure in \eqref{eqn:qr-i} is the reflection of a 
$\Z_3$-symmetry in the relevant contiguous relations 
(see \S\ref{subsec:cr}).  
Under condition \eqref{eqn:wd-i}, all the $q(n)$ and $r(n)$ have

Theorem \ref{thm:ete-i} is only a corollary to a specific example of  
infinitely many continued fractions with exact error 
estimates we shall establish in 
Theorems \ref{thm:cf-straight} and \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} (see Example \ref{ex:1}).  
To generate infinitely many continued fractions, we naturally need infinitely many 
contiguous relations, so we then need a general theory, beyond the scopes of 
Bailey \cite{Bailey2} and Wilson \cite{Wilson}, that presides over all contiguous 
relations for ${}_3F_2(1)$.  
Our previous paper \cite{EI} develops such a theory and the present article relies 
substantially on the main results of that paper.

\section{Contiguous and Recurrence Relations} \label{sec:contig}

The hypergeometric series of unit argument ${}_3F_2(1)$ with full five 
parameters is defined by 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation*} 
{}_3F_2\! 
\begin{pmatrix} 
a_0, & a_1, & a_2 \\ 
     & b_1, & b_2

\dfrac{(a_0; \, j) \, (a_1; \, j) \, (a_2; \, j)}{(1; \, j) \, 
(b_1; \, j) \, (b_2; \, j)}.    
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
With the notation $\ba = (a_0, a_1, a_2; a_3, a_4) = (a_0, a_1, a_2; b_1, b_2)$ 
this series is often denoted by ${}_3F_2(\ba)$. 
It is well defined and non-terminating as a formal sum if $\ba$ satisfies  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:WD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:WD} 
a_0, \, a_1, \, a_2, \, b_1, \, b_2 \, \not\in \, \Z_{\le 0},        
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
in which case ${}_3F_2(\ba)$ is absolutely convergent if and only if 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:3saal2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:3saal2}
\rRe \, s(\ba)  > 0, \qquad s(\ba) := b_1+b_2-a_0-a_1-a_2,   
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $s(\ba)$ is called the {\sl Saalsch\"{u}tzian index} for ${}_3F_2(\ba)$.  
We say that $\ba$ is {\sl balanced} if $s(\ba) = 0$.  
%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%% 
In order to discuss contiguous relations, however, we find it more convenient 
in many respects to replace ${}_3F_2(\ba)$ by the renormalized 
hypergeometric series defined by 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*} 
{}_3f_2(\ba) := \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} 
\dfrac{\vG(a_0+j) \vG(a_1+j) \vG(a_2+j) }{\vG(1+j) \vG(b_1+j) \vG(b_2+j)}.     
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This latter series is well defined and non-terminating as a formal sum, 
whenever 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*}
a_0, \, a_1, \, a_2 \, \not\in \, \Z_{\le 0} \qquad 
\mbox{(compare this with condition \eqref{eqn:WD})}, 
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
in which case series ${}_3f_2(\ba)$ is absolutely convergent 
if and only if \eqref{eqn:3saal2} is satisfied. 
Note that   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:Fvsf %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Fvsf}

It follows from \cite[Theorem 1.1]{EI} that for any distinct integer vectors 
$\bk$, $\bl \in \Z^5$ different from $\0$ there exist {\sl unique} rational functions 
$u(\ba)$, $v(\ba) \in \Q(\ba)$ such that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:3tcr %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:3tcr}
{}_3f_2(\ba) = u(\ba) \cdot {}_3f_2(\ba + \bk) + v(\ba) \cdot 
{}_3f_2(\ba + \bl).      
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An identity of the form \eqref{eqn:3tcr} is called a {\sl contiguous relation} for 
${}_3f_2(1)$.        
An algorithm to calculate $u(\ba)$ and $v(\ba)$ explicitly is given in 
\cite[Recipe 5.4]{EI}. 
According to it, one calculates the connection matrix $A(\ba; \bk)$ as in 
\cite[formula (30)]{EI} and define $r(\ba; \bk) \in \Q(\ba)$ to be its $(1, 2)$-entry 
as in \cite[formula (33)]{EI}. 
One also calculates $r(\ba; \bl)$ as well as $r(\ba; \bl-\bk)$ in similar manners. 
If $\bk$ and $\bl$ are distinct then $r(\ba; \bl-\bk)$ is nonzero in 
$\Q(\ba)$ and the coefficients in \eqref{eqn:3tcr} are represented as 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:uv %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:uv}

In order to formulate our main results in \S\ref{subsec:mrcf}, we need one more 
fact about the structure of $r(\ba; \bk)$ which is not discussed in \cite{EI}.    
Given a vector $\bk = (k_0,k_1,k_2; l_1, l_2) \in \Z^5$, let    
%%%%%%
\[
\langle \ba; \, \bk \rangle_{\pm} 
:= \prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 (b_j-a_i; \, (l_j-k_i)_{\pm}), 
\qquad   
|\!| \bk |\!|_+ := \sum_{i=0}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 (l_j-k_i)_+,   
\]
%%%%%%
where $m_{\pm} := \max\{ \pm m, 0\}$.  
Note that $\prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 (b_j-a_i; \, l_j-k_i) = 
\langle \ba; \bk \rangle_+/\langle \ba + \bk; \bk \rangle_-$.   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% lem:factorial %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:factorial}
For any nonzero vector $\bk \in \Z_{\ge 0}^5$ with $s(\bk) = 0$ there 
exists a nonzero polynomial $\rho(\ba; \bk) \in \Q[\ba]$ such that the rational 
function $r(\ba; \bk)$ can be written  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:rho %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:rho}
r(\ba; \bk) = - \frac{ \{ s(\ba) -1 \} \rho(\ba; \bk) }{\langle \ba; \, \bk \rangle_+}, 
\qquad  \deg \rho(\ba; \bk)  \le |\!| \bk |\!|_+ - 2.   
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   
\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}.      
A nonzero polynomial $p(\ba) \in \Q[\ba]$ is said to be a {\sl denominator} 
of a rational function $r(\ba) \in \Q(\ba)$ if the product $p(\ba) \, r(\ba)$ 
becomes a polynomial.  
A denominator of the least degree, which is unique up to constant multiples, 
is referred to as the {\sl reduced denominator}. 
Any denominator is divisible by the reduced denominator in $\Q[\ba]$. 
A denominator of a matrix with entries in $\Q(\ba)$ is, by definition, 
a common denominator of those entries.   
%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%% 
For $i = 0, 1, 2$,  $\mu = 1, 2$, let $\be_{\mu}^i := 
(\delta_{0i}, \delta_{1i}, \delta_{2i}; \delta_{1\mu}, \delta_{2\mu})$,   
where $\delta_{*\star}$ is Kronecker's delta.   
A vector of this form is said to be basic. 
A product of contiguous matrices in \cite[Table 2]{EI} yields   
%%%%%%
\[
A(\ba; \be_{\mu}^i) = \frac{1}{ (b_{\mu}-a_j)(b_{\mu}-a_k) }
\begin{pmatrix}
a_i(b_{\mu}-a_j-a_k) & s(\ba)-1 \\[1mm]
a_i a_j a_k & (a_i+1) b_{\mu} + a_j a_k - b_1 b_2 
\end{pmatrix},  
\]
%%%%%%%
where $\{i, j, k\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$. 
Any $\bk = (k_0, k_1, k_2; l_1, l_2) \in \Z_{\ge0}^5$ with $s(\bk) = 0$ 
admits a decomposition $\bk = \bv_l + \cdots + \bv_1$  
with each $\bv_i$ basic, so $A(\ba; \bk)$ can be computed by  
the chain rule    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:chain %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:chain}
A(\ba; \bk) = A(\ba+\bv_{l-1}+\cdots+\bv_1; \bv_l) \cdots 
A(\ba+\bv_1; \bv_2) A(\ba; \bv_1). 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Thus $A(\ba; \bk)$ has a denominator each irreducible factor of which is 
of the form $b_{\mu} - a_i + \mbox{an integer}$. 
A factor of this form is said to be of type $b_{\mu}- a_i$ and the 
product of all factors of this type is referred to as the 
$b_{\mu}-a_i$ component of the denominator.     
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par\smallskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf Claim}. For each $i = 0,1,2$ and $\mu = 1,2$ the matrix 
$A(\ba; \bk)$ admits a denominator whose $b_{\mu}- a_i$ 
component is exactly the factorial function $(b_{\mu}-a_i; (l_{\mu}-k_i)_+)$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par\smallskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To show the claim we may assume $i = 0$ and $\mu = 1$ without 
loss of generality.  
%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $m_0 := k_0-l_1 \ge 0$, then take the decomposition 
$\bk = l_1 \be_1^0 + m_0 \be_2^0 + k_1 \be_2^1 + k_2 \be_2^2$. 
\item If $m_1 := l_1-k_0 > 0$, then take the decomposition 
$\bk = k_{12} \be_2^1 + k_{22} \be_2^2 + k_0 \be_1^0 + k_{11} \be_1^1 
+ k_{21} \be_1^2$, 
where $k_{ij}$ are nonnegative integers such that $k_1 = k_{11}+k_{12}$, 
$k_2 = k_{21}+k_{22}$, $m_1 = k_{11}+k_{21}$ and $l_2 = k_{12} + k_{22}$;   
such $k_{ij}$ exist thanks to $\bk \in \Z_{\ge0}^5$ and $s(\bk) = 0$. 
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%
We use the fact that $A(\ba; m \be_{\mu}^i)$ has a denominator 
$(b_{\mu}-a_j; m)(b_{\mu}-a_k; m)$, where $\{i, j, k\} = \{0, 1, 2\}$, 
which follows by induction on $m \in \Z_{\ge0}$.  
In case (1) the decomposition of $\bk$ and the chain rule 
\eqref{eqn:chain} imply that $A(\ba; \bk)$ has a denominator 
without $b_1-a_0$ component. 
In case (2) the decomposition of $\bk$ leads to the product 
$A(\ba; \bk) = A_2(\ba; \bk) A_1(\ba; \bk)$ with 
%%%%%
\[
A_2(\ba; \bk) := A(\ba+k_{11} \be_1^1 + k_{21} \be_1^2; \, 
k_{12} \be_2^1 + k_{22} \be_2^2 + k_1 \be_1^0), \quad 
A_1(\ba; \bk) := A(\ba; k_{11} \be_1^1 + k_{21} \be_1^2). 
\]
%%%%%
Observe that $A_1(\ba; \bk)$ has a denominator whose $b_1-a_0$ 
component is $(b_1-a_0; k_{11}+k_{21}) = (b_1-a_0; m_1)$, 
while $A_2(\ba; \bk)$ has a denominator without 
$b_1-a_0$ component.  
So $A(\ba; \bk)$ has a denominator whose $b_1-a_0$ 
component is $(b_1-a_0; m_1)$. 
The claim is thus verified.  
%%%%%
\par
%%%%%
For each entry of $A(\ba; \bk)$ the Claim implies that for $i = 0,1,2$ and  
$\mu = 1, 2$ the $b_{\mu}-a_i$ component of its reduced denominator 
must divide the factorial  $(b_{\mu}-a_i; \, (l_{\mu}-k_i)_+)$, so the reduced denominator itself must divide the product 
$\langle \ba; \bk \rangle_+ = \prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{\mu=1}^2 
(b_{\mu}-a_i; \, (l_{\mu}-k_i)_+)$. 
Thus one can take $\langle \ba; \bk \rangle_+$ as a denominator of 
$A(\ba; \bk)$. 
The {\sl index} of a rational function is the degree of its numerator 
minus that of its denominator. 
An induction on the length $l$ of product \eqref{eqn:chain} shows that 
the index $\le i-j$ for the $(i, j)$-entry of $A(\ba; \bk)$.  
Another induction shows that the $(1, 2)$-entry is divisible by $s(\ba)-1$. 
All these facts lead to expression \eqref{eqn:rho} for $r(\ba; \bk)$.

If $\bk$ is nonnegative, $\bk \in \Z_{\ge 0}^5$, then 
so are $\bl$ and $\bp$ by formula \eqref{eqn:lp}, 
hence all $f(n)$, $n \in \Z_{\ge 0}$, are well defined under single 
assumption \eqref{eqn:WD}. 
If moreover $\bk$ is {\sl balanced}, $s(\bk) = 0$, then so are $\bl$ and

have the same Saalsch\"utzian index.    
Thus all these series are convergent under the single

In what follows we refer to $\bk$ as the {\sl seed} vector while $\bp$ as the

${}_3h_2(\ba) := \exp( \pi \sqrt{-1} \, s(\ba)) \, {}_3g_2(\ba)$, but    
the factor $\exp( \pi \sqrt{-1} \, s(\ba))$ is irrelevant by

solutions to \eqref{eqn:3trr-x} respectively, so that $R(m) \to 0$ as

In order to apply this general estimate to continued fractions for ${}_3f_2(1)$, 
we want to set up the situation in which the sequences $f(n)$ in 
\eqref{eqn:f(n)}  and $g(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:gg(n)} are recessive and dominant 
solutions, respectively,  to the recurrence relation \eqref{eqn:u3trr}.   
We present in \S\ref{sec:cspm} a sufficient condition for $f(n)$ to be recessive,  
while we impose in \S \ref{sec:ds} a further constraint that insures the 
dominance of $g(n)$.  
In fact, upon assuming those conditions, we deduce asymptotic representations 
for $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ showing that they are actually recessive and dominant 
respectively.  
The asymptotic analysis there is used not only to prove such a qualitative 
assertion but also to get a precise asymptotic behavior for the ratio 
$R(n) = f(n+2)/g(n+2)$.  
We have also to evaluate the initial term $\omega(0)$ for the Casoratian  
of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$; this final task is done in \S \ref{sec:casorati}.

\eqref{eqn:q(n)} and \eqref{eqn:r(n)} derived from $u(\ba)$ and $v(\ba)$ 
as in formula \eqref{eqn:uv2}. 
Consider the continued fraction $\mathbf{K}_{j=0}^{\infty} \, r(j)/q(j)$, where 
$r(0) := 1$ by convention.  
It is said to be {\sl well defined} if $q(j)$ and $r(j)$ take finite values with 
$r(j)$ nonzero for every $j \ge 0$.

Let $\cS(\R)$ be the set of all real vectors 
$\bp = (p_0, p_1, p_2; q_1, q_2) \in \R^5$ such that 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:bp %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

s(\bp) = 0; \qquad p_1, \, p_2 \le p_0 < q_1 \le q_2 < p_1 + p_2. 
\end{equation}  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Note that \eqref{eqn:bp} in particular implies $p_1, p_2 > 0$ and that $\cS(\R)$ 
is a $4$-dimensional polyhedral convex cone defined by a linear equation and a 
set of linear inequalities. 
It is the space to which the shift vector $\bp$ in \eqref{eqn:lp} should 
belong; or rather as an integer vector it should lie on   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:cS(Z) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\cS(\Z) := \cS(\R) \cap \Z^5.

The following functions of $\bp \in \cS(\R)$ play important 
roles in several places of this article:     
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:A(p) %%%%% eqn:v(p) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}  
D(\bp) &:= \dfrac{(-1)^{q_1+q_2} p_0^{p_0} p_1^{p_1} p_2^{p_2}}{\prod_{i=0}^2 
\prod_{j=1}^2 (q_j - p_i)^{q_j - p_i}},   \label{eqn:A(p)}  \\[2mm] 
\vD(\bp) &:= e_1^2 e_2^2 + 18 \, e_1 e_2 e_3  
- 2 \, e_2^3 - 8 \, e_1^3 e_3 - 27 \, e_3^2,     
\label{eqn:v(p)} 
\end{align}   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $e_1 := p_0+p_1+p_2 = q_1+q_2$,  
$e_2 := p_0 p_1 + p_1 p_2 + p_2 p_0 + q_1 q_2$ and $e_3 := p_0 p_1 p_2$. 
We remark that $\vD(\bp)$ is the discriminant (up to a positive 
constant multiple) of the cubic equation 
%%%%%%
\[
(x-p_0)(x-p_1)(x-p_2) + x (x-q_1) (x-q_2) = 0,  
\]   
%%%%%%
which plays an important role in \S \ref{subsec:2nd}.  
Moreover, for $\bk = (k_0, k_1, k_2; l_1, l_2) \in \Z^5$ we put  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:gamma(a) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

in terms of the seed vector $\bk$, but a large part of their proofs will be

{\it Proof}. 
The proof is an application of the standard Laplace method to the 
integral \eqref{eqn:eif}, so only an outline of it is presented below.  
Replacing $\ba$ with $\ba + n \, \bk$ in 
definition \eqref{eqn:eu}, we have  
%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*}
E_p(\ba + n \, \bk) 
= \int_{I^p} \Phi(\bt)^n \cdot u(\bt) \, d \bt  
= \int_{I^p} e^{- n \, \phi(\sbt)} \cdot u(\bt) \, d \bt,  
\end{equation*}
%%%%%%%
where $\Phi(\bt)$, $\phi(\bt)$ and $u(\bt)$ are defined by 
%%%%%%%
\[
\Phi(\bt) := \prod_{i=1}^p t_i^{k_{i}}(1-t_i)^{l_i-k_i}, \qquad 
\phi(\bt) := - \log \Phi(\bt), \qquad u(\bt) := \phi_p(\bt; \ba). 
\]
%%%%%%%
Observe that $\phi(\bt)$ attains a unique minimum at 
$\bt_0 := (k_1/l_1, \dots, k_p/l_p)$ in the interval $I^p$, 
since  
%%%%%%%
\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t_i} = 
- \frac{k_i}{t_i} + \frac{l_i-k_i}{1-t_i} = \frac{l_i t_i - k_i}{t_i(1-t_i)}, 
\qquad 
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t_i^2} 
= \frac{k_i}{t_i^2} + \frac{l_i - k_i}{(1-t_i)^2} > 0, 
\qquad 
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t_i \partial t_j} = 0 \quad (i \neq j).  
\]
%%%%%%%
The standard formula for Laplace's approximation then leads to 
%%%%%%%
\[
\begin{split}
\int_{I^p} e^{- n \, \phi(\sbt)} \cdot u(\bt) \, d \bt 
&= \dfrac{u(\bt_0)}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hess}(\phi; \bt_0)}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
By formulas \eqref{eqn:tentative2} and \eqref{eqn:eif} the sequence 
\eqref{eqn:tentative} can be written $f(n) = \psi_2(n) \, e_2(n)$ with  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:psi2e2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Conditions $s(\bp) = 0$ and \eqref{eqn:rs-a} imply that $p_1$, $p_2 > 0$ and 
$q_j - p_i > 0$ for every $j = 1$, $2$ and $i = 0$, $j$, so Stirling's formula 
applied to \eqref{eqn:psi2} yields an asymptotic representation

\[

\qquad 
B := \frac{\vG(s(\ba)) \cdot p_1^{a_1- \frac{1}{2} } \, 
p_2^{a_2- \frac{1}{2} }}{ 2 \pi \, \prod_{j=1}^2 \prod_{i=0, j}

When $p = 2$, $k_1 = q_1-p_0$, $k_2 = q_2-p_0$, $l_1 = p_1$, $l_2 = p_2$, 
condition \eqref{eqn:liki} becomes \eqref{eqn:rs-a}, so 
Proposition \ref{prop:cspm} applies to the sequence \eqref{eqn:e2}. 
In this situation we have $\Phim = A^{-1}$ in \eqref{eqn:Phim-C1} 
and $C = B^{-1} \cdot \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot 
\{p_1p_2-(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0)\}^{-s(\sba)}$ in \eqref{eqn:Phim-C2}, 
where we have $p_1 p_2 -(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0) = s_2(\bp)$

\section{Discrete Laplace Method} \label{sec:dspm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
When a solution to a recurrence equation is given in terms of 
hypergeometric series, we want to know its asymptotic behavior and 
thereby to check whether it is actually a dominant solution.  
To this end, regarding the series as a ``discrete" integral, 
we develop a {\sl discrete Laplace method} as an analogue to 
the usual (continuous) Laplace method for ordinary integrals.  
While Theorems \ref{thm:cf-straight} and \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} on continued 
fractions are the final goal of this article, the main result of this section, 
Theorem \ref{thm:dspm}, and the method leading to it are the 
methodological core of the article.       
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Formulation} \label{subsec:miar}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $\bsigma = (\sigma_i) \in \R^I$, $\blambda = (\lambda_i) \in \R^I$, 
$\btau = (\tau_j) \in \R^J$, $\bmu = (\mu_j) \in \R^J$ be {\sl real} numbers 
indexed by finite sets $I$ and $J$. 
Suppose that the pairs $(\bsigma, \btau)$ and $(\blambda, \bmu)$ are {\sl balanced} 
to the effect that   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:ap-bq2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:ap-bq2}
\sum_{i \in I} \sigma_i = \sum_{j \in J} \tau_j, \qquad 
\sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i = \sum_{j \in J} \mu_j.    
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
Let $\bal(n) = (\alpha_i(n)) \in \C^I$ and $\bbeta(n) = (\beta_j(n))  \in \C^J$ be 
sequences in $n \in \N$ of complex numbers indexed by $i \in I$ and $j \in J$. 
Suppose that they are {\sl bounded}, that is, for some constant $R > 0$,   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:bdd %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:bdd}
|\alpha_i(n) | \le R \quad (i \in I); \qquad |\beta_j(n) | \le R \quad (j \in J), 
\qquad {}^{\forall}n \in \N.  
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In practical applications $\bal(n)$ and $\bbeta(n)$ will typically be independent 
of $n$, however allowing such a moderate dependence upon $n$ as in 
\eqref{eqn:bdd} is quite helpful in developing the theory.  
%%%%%%

Given $0 \le r_0 < r_1 \le + \infty$, we consider the sum of gamma products  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:g(n) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:g(n)}
g(n) := \sum_{k = \lceil r_0 n \rceil}^{\lceil r_1 n \rceil-1} G(k; n), \quad  
G(k; n) := \dfrac{\prod_{i \in I}
 \vG( \sigma_i \, k + \lambda_i \, n + \alpha_i(n))}{\prod_{j \in J} 
\vG( \tau_j \, k + \mu_j \, n + \beta_j(n))}, \quad n \in \N,       
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
where $\lceil x \rceil := \min \{ m \in \Z \,:\, x \le m \}$ denotes the ceiling function.   
We remark that the {\sl reflection} of discrete variable 
$k \mapsto \lceil r_0 n \rceil + \lceil r_1 n \rceil -1 -k$ in \eqref{eqn:g(n)} induces an involution 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:refl %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{subequations} \label{eqn:refl}
\begin{alignat}{3}
\sigma_i' &= - \sigma_i, \qquad  & \lambda_i' &= \lambda_i + \sigma_i (r_0 + r_1),  \qquad & 
\alpha_i'(n) &= \alpha_i(n) - \sigma_i \, r(n),  \label{eqn:refl-s} \\
   \tau_j' &= - \tau_j,     \qquad  & \mu_j'      &= \mu_j + \tau_j (r_0 + r_1), \qquad & 
\beta_j'(n) &= \beta_j(n)  - \tau_j \, r(n),   \label{eqn:refl-t}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $r(n) := (r_0+r_1) n +1 - \lceil r_0 n \rceil - \lceil r_1 n \rceil $ and the resulting     
data are indicated with a prime, while the reflection leaves $r_0$ and $r_1$ unchanged.  
Since $-1 < r(n) \le 1$, if $\alpha_i(n)$ and $\beta_j(n)$ are bounded then so are 
$\alpha_i'(n)$ and $\beta_j'(n)$.  
This reflectional symmetry is helpful in some occasions. 
Moreover, for any integer $s \le r_0$ the {\sl shift} $k \mapsto k + s n$ in 
\eqref{eqn:g(n)} results in the translations   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:shift %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:shift}
r_0 \mapsto r_0 - s, \quad r_1 \mapsto r_1 - s; \quad 
\sigma_i \mapsto \sigma_i, \quad \lambda_i \mapsto  \lambda_i + \sigma_i s; \quad 
\tau_j \mapsto \tau_j, \quad \mu_j \mapsto \mu_j + \tau_j s.     
\end{equation}    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Taking $s = \lfloor r_0 \rfloor$ we may assume $0 \le r_0 < 1$, where 
$\lfloor x \rfloor := \max \{ m \in \Z \,:\, m \le x \}$ is the floor function.    
This normalization is also sometimes convenient.

where if $r_1 = +\infty$ then by $l_i( r_1 ) \ge 0$ and $m_j( r_1 ) \ge 0$ we mean 
$\sigma_i > 0$ and $\tau_j > 0$. 
Condition \eqref{eqn:ap-bq1} says that $l_i(x)$ and $m_j(x)$ are non-constant affine functions 
taking nonnegative values at both ends of the interval $[r_0, \, r_1]$, so they must be

This ``uniformly away from zero'' property will be important in applying a version

\quad  i \in I_{\nu}, \,\,  \nu = 0, 1, \,\, n \in \N,

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
then the sum $g(n)$ is well defined, that is, every summand 
$G(k; n) = H(k/n; n)$ in \eqref{eqn:g(n)} takes a finite value for any 
$n \ge (R+1)/c$ with $R$ and $c$ given in \eqref{eqn:bdd} and 
\eqref{eqn:positive2}.      
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{lemma} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
By condition \eqref{eqn:ap-bq11}, if $i \in I_0$ then $0 \le l_i( r_1 ) = l_i( r_1 ) - 
l_i( r_0 ) = (r_1-r_0) \sigma_i$ with $r_1-r_0 > 0$ and $\sigma_i \neq 0$, 
which forces $\sigma_i > 0$, while if $i \in I_1$ then  $0 \le l_i( r_0 ) = l_i( r_0 ) - 
l_i( r_1 ) = (r_0-r_1) \sigma_i$ with $r_0-r_1 < 0$ and $\sigma_i \neq 0$, 
which forces $\sigma_i < 0$.  
A similar argument using \eqref{eqn:ap-bq12} leads to the assertions for 
$J_0$ and $J_1$.   
The sum $g(n)$ fails to make sense only when the argument of an upper gamma 
factor of a summand $G(k; n)$ takes a negative integer value or zero, that is,  
%%%%%
\[
\sigma_i k + \lambda_i n + \alpha_i(n)  = l_i(k/n) \, n + \alpha_i(n)  \in \Z_{\le 0}, 
\qquad {}^{\exists} i \in I, \quad 
\lceil r_0 n \rceil \le {}^{\exists} k \le \lceil r_1 n \rceil -1.  
\]
%%%%% 
This cannot occur for $i \in I \setminus (I_0 \cup I_1)$ and $n \ge (R+1)/c$,  
since \eqref{eqn:bdd} and \eqref{eqn:positive2} imply that 
$l_i(k/n) \, n + \rRe \, \alpha_i(n) \ge c n -R \ge 1$ for any  
$k \in \Z$ such that $r_0 \le k/n \le r_1$. 
Observe that 
%%%%%
\[
\sigma_i k + \lambda_i n + \alpha_i(n) = \sigma_i \, l + l_i(r_0) n + 
\alpha^{(0)}_i(n) = \sigma_i \, l + \alpha^{(0)}_i(n), \qquad i \in I_0,  
\]
%%%%%
where $l := k - \lceil r_0 n \rceil$ ranges over 
$0, 1, \dots, \lceil r_1 n \rceil - \lceil r_0 n \rceil -1$. 
This cannot be a negative integer or zero, if condition \eqref{eqn:punc0} is 
satisfied for $\nu = 0$.      
A similar argument can be made for $\nu = 1$, since condition \eqref{eqn:punc0} 
for $\nu =1$ is obtained from that for $\nu=0$ by applying reflectional 
symmetry \eqref{eqn:refl}.   
Thus if \eqref{eqn:punc0} is satisfied then $g(n)$ is well defined for 
$n \ge (R+1)/c$. 
\hfill $\Box$ \par\medskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To carry out analysis it is convenient to quantify condition \eqref{eqn:punc0} 
by writing   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:punc %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:punc}
\delta_{\nu}(n) := \min \Big\{ \, 1, \,

\Z_{\le 0} + |\sigma_i| \Z_{\le - \nu}) \, \Big\} > 0, \quad \nu = 0, 1, \,\, 
n \in \N, 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\mathrm{dist}(z, Z)$ stands for the distance between a point $z$ and 
a set $Z$ in $\C$, and cut off by $1$ is simply to make 
$\delta_{\nu}(n) \le 1$ as it really works only when $0 < \delta_{\nu}(n) \ll 1$.   
Condition \eqref{eqn:punc} or \eqref{eqn:punc0} is referred to as the 
{\sl genericness} for the data $\bal(n)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $|I|$ and $|J|$ are the cardinalities of $I$ and $J$.  
We refer to $\Phi(x)$ as the {\sl multiplicative phase function} for the 
sum $g(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:g(n)}. 
%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%
Thanks to positivity \eqref{eqn:positive} the function $\Phi(x)$ is smooth  
and positive on $(r_0, \, r_1)$. 
If we employ the convention $0^0 = 1$, which is natural in view of    
the limit $x^x = 1$ as $x \to +0$, then $\Phi(x)$ is continuous and positive 
at $x = r_0$ as well as at $x = r_1$ when $r_1 < +\infty$, even if some of the 
$l_i(x)$'s or $m_j(x)$'s vanish at one or both endpoints. 
When $r_1 = + \infty$, some calculations using balancedness condition 
\eqref{eqn:ap-bq2} shows that   
%%%%%%
\[
\Phi(x) = \left( \bsigma^{\sblambda} / \btau^{\sbmu} \right) \cdot 
\left( \bsigma^{\sbsigma} / \btau^{\sbtau} \right)^x \cdot 
\left \{ 1 + O(1/x) \right\} \quad \mbox{as} \quad x \to + \infty, 
\]
%%%%%%   
where $\bsigma^{\sbsigma} := \prod_{i \in I} \sigma_i^{\sigma_i}$, 
$\bsigma^{\sblambda} := \prod_{i \in I} \sigma_i^{\lambda_i}$ and 
so on; note that all of $\sigma_i$ and $\tau_j$ are positive due to the 
admissibility condition \eqref{eqn:ap-bq1} for the $r_1 = + \infty$ case. 
Thus it is natural to define  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:Phi(inf) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:Phi(inf)}
\Phi(+ \infty) := 
\begin{cases}
0 \quad & (\mbox{if} \,\,\, \bsigma^{\sbsigma} < \btau^{\sbtau} ), \\[1mm]
\bsigma^{\sblambda} / \btau^{\sbmu} \quad & 
(\mbox{if} \,\,\,  \bsigma^{\sbsigma} = \btau^{\sbtau} ),  \\[1mm]
+\infty \quad & (\mbox{if} \,\,\, \bsigma^{\sbsigma} > \btau^{\sbtau} ).  
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
With this understanding we assume the {\sl continuity at infinity}:    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:infty %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:infty}
\bsigma^{\sbsigma} \le \btau^{\sbtau} \qquad (\mbox{when} \,\,\, r_1 = + \infty).   
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Then $\Phi(x)$ is continuous on $[r_0, \, r_1]$ even when $r_1 = + \infty$ and 
it makes sense to define 
%%%%%
\[
\Phim := \max_{r_0 \le x \le r_1} \Phi(x),  
\]
%%%%%     
as a positive finite number. 
Therefore the function    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:phi %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:phi}
\phi(x) := - \log \Phi(x)  
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
is a real-valued, continuous function on $[r_0, \, r_1)$, smooth in $(r_0, \, r_1)$; 
if $r_1 < + \infty$ then it is also continuous at $x = r_1$; otherwise, $\phi(x)$ 
is either continuous at $x = + \infty$ or tends to $+ \infty$ as $x \to + \infty$.   
We refer to $\phi(x)$ as the {\sl additive phase function} for the sum $g(n)$ in 
\eqref{eqn:g(n)}.  
%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%%
When $r_1 = + \infty$ we have to think of the (absolute)  
{\sl convergence} of infinite series \eqref{eqn:g(n)}.  
If the strict inequality $\bsigma^{\sbsigma} < \btau^{\sbtau}$ holds in 
\eqref{eqn:infty} then it certainly converges. 
Otherwise, in order to guarantee its convergence, suppose that 
there is a constant $\sigma > 0$ such that for any $n \in \N$,    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:conv %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:conv}
\rRe \, \gamma(n) \le -1-\sigma  \qquad 
(\mbox{if $\bsigma^{\sbsigma} = \btau^{\sbtau}$}), 
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:ga(n) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:ga(n)} 
\gamma(n) := \sum_{i \in I} \alpha_i(n) - \sum_{j \in J} 
\beta_j(n) + \frac{|J|-|I|}{2}.    
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%
Thanks to positivity \eqref{eqn:positive} the function $u(x; n)$ is also smooth 
and nowhere vanishing on $(r_0, \, r_1)$, but it may be singular at one or both 
ends of the interval when some of the $l_i(x)$'s or $m_j(x)$'s vanish there.   
To deal with this situation we say that $g(n)$ is {\sl left-regular} if 
$I_0 \cup J_0 = \emptyset$;  {\sl right-regular} if $I_1 \cup J_1 = \emptyset$; 
and {\sl regular} if $I_0 \cup J_0 \cup I_1 \cup J_1 = \emptyset$. 
If $g(n)$ is left-regular resp. right-regular with $r_1 < + \infty$, then 
$u(x; n)$ is continuous at $x = r_0$ resp. $x = r_1$. 
When $r_1 < + \infty$ the reflectional symmetry \eqref{eqn:refl} exchanges 
left and right regularities to each other.       
We remark that if $r_1 = + \infty$ then right-regularity automatically follows 
from admissibility.

The maximum of $\Phi(x)$ or equivalently the minimum of $\phi(x)$ plays 
a leading role in our analysis, so it is important to think of the first 
and second derivatives of $\phi(x)$. 
Differentiations of \eqref{eqn:phi} with balancedness condition

Denote by $\Mm$ the set of all maximum points of $\Phi(x)$ on $[r_0, \, r_1]$. 
Suppose that $\Phi(x)$ attains its maximum $\Phim$ only within $(r_0, \, r_1)$, 
that is, $r_0$, $r_1 \not \in \Mm$.  
Moreover suppose that  every maximum point is {\sl nondegenerate} to the effect that  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:max %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:max}

which is referred to as {\sl properness} of the maximum.         
By formula \eqref{eqn:dash1} any $x \in \Mm$ is a root of

\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
which is called the {\sl characteristic equation} for $g(n)$, while $\chi( x )$ 
is referred to as the {\sl characteristic function} for $g(n)$.  
It is easy to see that equation \eqref{eqn:max-eq} has only a finite number of roots, 
unless $\chi(x) \equiv 0$, so $\Mm$ must be a finite set.      
Note that $\phi'(x)$ and $\chi(x)$ have the same sign.   
%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%% 
Equation \eqref{eqn:max-eq} can be used to determine the set $\Mm$ explicitly. 
In applications to hypergeometric series, one usually puts $\sigma_i$, $\tau_j = 
\pm 1$ 
and $\lambda_i$, $\mu_j \in \Z$, thus \eqref{eqn:max-eq} is equivalent to an 
algebraic equation with integer coefficients and hence any $x \in \Mm$ 
must be an algebraic number. 
In this case with $r_1 = +\infty$, since $\bsigma^{\sbsigma} = \btau^{\sbtau} = 
\bsigma^{\sblambda} = \btau^{\sbmu} = 1$, the continuity at infinity \eqref{eqn:infty} 
is trivially satisfied with $\Phi(+ \infty) = 1$ in \eqref{eqn:Phi(inf)}, thus condition 
$\Mm \Subset (r_0, \, +\infty)$ in \eqref{eqn:max} includes $\Phim > 1$.

Things are simpler when $\Mm$ consists of a single point $x_0 \in (r_0, \, r_1)$,

We want to think of $h(n)$ as the principal part of $g(n)$, while other 
four components as remainders.  
Thus estimating the top component $h(n)$ is the central issue of this section,

For the sake of simplicity we shall deal with the case $|\Mm| = 1$ only, 
but even when $|\Mm| \ge 2$ things are essentially the same and it 
will be clear how to modify the arguments.  
The reflectional symmetry \eqref{eqn:refl} reduces the discussion 
at the right end or right side to the discussion at the left counterpart.     
The top and side sums are regular, so we shall begin by estimating regular

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
Since $g(n)$ is regular, that is, $I_0 \cup I_1 \cup J_0 \cup J_1 = \emptyset$, we 
have the uniform positivity \eqref{eqn:positive2} for all $i \in I$, $j \in J$ and 
$x \in [r_0, \, r_1]$.   
This together with boundedness \eqref{eqn:bdd} allows us to apply Stirling's 
formula \eqref{eqn:stirling} to all gamma factors  
$\vG(l_i(x) n + \alpha_i(n))$ and $\vG(m_j(x) n + \beta_j(n))$ of $H(x; n)$ in  \eqref{eqn:H}. 
Taking definitions \eqref{eqn:G-asymp2} and \eqref{eqn:ga(n)} into account  
we use formula \eqref{eqn:stirling} to have

\[
H(x; n) = u(x; n) \cdot n^{\gamma(n)} \cdot \Phi(x)^n \cdot

where the $O(1/n)$ term is uniform with respect to $x \in [r_0, \, r_1]$ as 
well as to $\bal(n)$ and $\bbeta(n)$ satisfying condition \eqref{eqn:bdd}.

First we consider the case $r_1 < + \infty$. 
Since $g(n)$ is regular and $\bal(n)$ and $\bbeta(n)$ are bounded by 
assumption \eqref{eqn:bdd}, the definition \eqref{eqn:u} implies that $u(x; n)$ 
is bounded for $(x, n) \in [r_0, \, r_1] \times \Z_{\ge N_0}$. 
Replacing the constant $C_0$ by a larger one if necessary, we have 
$|H(x; n)| \le C_0 \cdot n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n)} 
\cdot \Phim^{\, n}$ for any $x \in [r_0, \, r_1]$ and $n \ge N_0$. 
Thus by definitions \eqref{eqn:g(n)} and \eqref{eqn:H} we have for any 
$n \ge N_0$,   
%%%%%
\begin{align*}
|g(n)| & \le \sum_{k=\lceil r_0 n \rceil}^{\lceil r_1 n \rceil -1} |H(k/n; n)|

\sum_{k=\lceil r_0 n \rceil}^{\lceil r_1 n \rceil -1} 1 \\ 
& = C_0 \cdot n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n)} \cdot \Phim^{\, n} \cdot 
(\lceil r_1 n \rceil - \lceil r_0 n \rceil) 
\le C_1 \cdot n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n) + 1} \cdot \Phim^{\, n},  
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%
with the constant $C_1 := C_0 (1+r_1-r_0)$.   
%%%%%
\par
%%%%%
We proceed to the case $r_1 = + \infty$ and $\bsigma^{\sbsigma} = 
\btau^{\sbtau}$ in which condition \eqref{eqn:conv} takes place.    
Since $g(n)$ is regular and $\bal(n)$ and $\bbeta(n)$ are bounded by  
\eqref{eqn:bdd}, the definition \eqref{eqn:u} implies that 
%%%%%%
\[
u(x; n) = 
(2 \pi)^{ \frac{|I|-|J|}{2} } \, 
\prod_{i \in I} \sigma_i^{\alpha_i(n) - \frac{1}{2}} 
\prod_{j \in J} \tau_j^{\frac{1}{2}-\beta_j(n)} \cdot x^{\gamma(n)} 
\cdot \{ 1 + O(1/x) \} \qquad \mbox{as} \quad x \to + \infty, 
\]
%%%%%%
uniformly for $n \in \N$. 
By condition \eqref{eqn:conv} there exists a constant $C_2 > 0$ 
such that       
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
|u(x; n)| \le C_2 \, (2+x)^{-1-\sigma}, \qquad 
{}^{\forall} x \ge r_0, \,\, {}^{\forall} n \ge N_0.     
\]
%%%%%%%%%%
In view of definitions \eqref{eqn:g(n)} and \eqref{eqn:H} this estimate 
together with formula \eqref{eqn:reg-bd-es1} yields 
%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
|g(n)| &\le \sum_{k=\lceil r_0 n \rceil}^{\infty} |H(k/n; n)| 
\le C_2 \, (1+C_0) \cdot n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n) +1} \cdot \Phim^{\, n} 
\sum_{k=\lceil r_0 n \rceil}^{\infty} 
\left( 2+\frac{k}{n} \right)^{-1-\sigma} \frac{1}{n} \\
& \le C_2 \, (1+C_0) \cdot n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n) +1} \cdot \Phim^{\, n} 
\int_{r_0}^{\infty} \left( 1+ x \right)^{-1-\sigma} \, d x = C_1 \cdot 
n^{\rRe \, \gamma(n) + 1} \cdot \Phim^{\, n}, 
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%
for any integer $n \ge N_0$, where $C_1 := C_2 \, (1+C_0)\, 
(1+r_0)^{-\sigma}/\sigma $.  
%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%%
The proof ends with the case where $r_1 = + \infty$ and 
$\bsigma^{\sbsigma} < \btau^{\sbtau}$. 
By Stirling's formula \eqref{eqn:stirling} there exists a constant 
$C_3 > 0$ such that $|H(x; n)| \le C_3 \cdot (x n)^{\rRe \, \gamma(n)} 
\cdot \Phi(x)^n$ and $\Phi(x) \le C_3 \cdot \rho^x$ with 
$\rho := \bsigma^{\sbsigma}/\btau^{\sbtau} < 1$  
for any $x \ge r_0$ and $n \ge N_0$. 
Take a number $r_2 > r_0$ so large that 
$d := C_3 \cdot \rho^{r_2/2} < \Phim$ and let $g(n) = g_1(n) + g_2(n)$ 
be the decomposition according to the division 
$[r_0, \,+\infty) = [r_0, \, r_2) \cup [r_2, \, +\infty)$.  
Then an estimate for the $r_1 < + \infty$ case applies to 
$g_1(n)$, while $|H(x; n)| \le C_3 \cdot d^n \cdot (x n)^c \cdot 
\rho^{x n/2}$ for $x \ge r_2$, where $c := \sup_{n \ge N_0} 
\rRe \, \gamma(n)$, and hence     
%%%%%%%
\[
|g_2(n)| \le \sum_{k=\lceil r_2 n \rceil}^{\infty} |H(k/n; n)| \le 
C_3 \cdot d^n \sum_{k = \lceil r_2 n \rceil}^{\infty} k^c \cdot \rho^{k/2} 
\le C_3 \cdot d^n \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} k^c \cdot \rho^{k/2} 
= C_4 \cdot d^n   
\]
%%%%%%%

\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
We have only to apply Proposition \ref{prop:reg-bd} with $r_0$ and $r_1$ 
replaced by $r_0 + \ve$ and $x_0-\ve$ to deduce the estimate for $h_0(n)$.  
In a similar manner we apply the proposition this time with $r_0$ and $r_1$

\subsection{Top Component} \label{subsec:t-s} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
We consider the top component $h(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:divide}. 
Recall the setting in \S \ref{subsec:results} that $\Mm = \{ x_0 \} \Subset 
(r_0, \, r_1)$, $\Phim = \Phi( x_0 ) = e^{- \phi( x_0)}$, $\phi'( x_0 ) = 0$ and 
$\phi''( x_0 ) > 0$. 
Since the sum $h(n)$ is regular, Lemma \ref{lem:H} implies that $H(x; n)$ 
can be written as in \eqref{eqn:H-asymp1} with 
estimate \eqref{eqn:H-asymp2} now being 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:C0(ve) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:C0(ve)}
|e( x; n)| \le C_0(\ve)/n, \qquad

\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%    
The local study of $H(x; n)$ near $x = x_0 $ is best performed in terms of 
new variables  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*} 
y := x- x_0 \quad \mbox{(shift)}; \qquad 
z := \sqrt{n} \, y \quad \mbox{(scale change)}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Taylor expansions around $x = x_0 $ show that $\phi( x )$ and $u (x; n) $ can 
be written 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% eqn:taylor %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{alignat}{3}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
with $a := \ts \frac{1}{2} \, \phi''( x_0 ) > 0$ and some positive constants $b$, $c$, 
$\ve_1 > 0$.   
It is clear that $a$ and $b$ are independent of $n$.  
We can also take $c$ and $\ve_1$ uniformly in $n$ because 
$\bal(n)$ and $\bbeta(n)$ are bounded by assumption \eqref{eqn:bdd}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
then formula \eqref{eqn:H-asymp1} yields 
$H(x; n) = H_{\ra}(x; n) + H_{\rb}(x; n) + H_{\rc}(x; n)$, which in turn gives

{\it Proof}. If $\rRe \, z > 0$ we have $\mathrm{dist}(z, \, \Z_{\le 0}) = |z|$ 
and the results follows readily.  
If $\rRe \, z \le 0$ then $\rRe (z+m) \ge 1$ and so the sequence 
$|z|, |z+1|, \cdots, |z+m-1|$ contains $\mathrm{dist}(z, \Z_{\le 0})$ as its 
minimum with the next smallest $\ge 1/2$ and all the rest $\ge 1$, 
thus $|(z; \, m)| = |z||z+1|\cdots |z+m-1| \ge \mathrm{dist}(z, \Z_{\le 0})/2$,

A bit of differential calculus shows the following: 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item[(i)] If either $\rho_0 > 0$ or $\rho_0 = 0$ with $\Phi_0 \le 1$, then 
$\varphi(t; n)$ is non-increasing in $t \ge 0$ and hence  
$\varphi(t; n) \le \varphi(0; n) = 1 = \Psi_0(\ve)^n$ for any $t \ge 0$. 
\item[(ii)] If either $\rho_0 < 0$ or $\rho_0 = 0$ with $\Phi_0 > 1$, 
then $\frac{d}{d t} \varphi (t; n) \ge 0$ in $0 \le t \le \ve_3 \, n$ with 
equality only when $t = \ve_3 \, n$, so that $\varphi(t; n) \le 
\varphi(\ve n; n) = (\ve^{\rho_0} \Phi_0)^{\ve n} = \Psi_0(\ve)^n$ 
for any $0 \le t \le \ve n$ $(< \ve_3 \, n)$, where $\ve_3$ and 
$\Psi_0(\ve)$ are defined in \eqref{eqn:del0} and \eqref{eqn:Psi0} respectively. 
\end{enumerate} 
In either case $0 < \varphi(t; n) \le \Psi_0(\ve)^n$ for any

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% rem:ds %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{remark} \label{rem:ds} 
Conditions \eqref{eqn:bp} and \eqref{eqn:cond-key} are 
invariant under multiplication of $\bp$ by any positive scalar. 
This homogeneity allows one to restrict $\cS(\R)$ to 
$\cS_1(\R) := \cS(\R) \cap \{ q_1 = 1\}$, which is a $3$-dimensional 
solid tetrahedron.  
A numerical integration shows that the domain in $\cS_1(\R)$ 
bounded by inequalities \eqref{eqn:cond-key} occupies some $43$ \% 
of the whole $\cS_1(\R)$ in volume basis.  
Thus we may say that about $43$ \% of the vectors in $\cS(\Z)$ 
satisfy condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key}. 
\end{remark}

%%%%%%
By the definition of ${}_3g_2(\ba)$ one can write $g(n) := 
{}_3g_2(\ba + n \bp) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \varphi(k; n)$ with   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\varphi(k; n) :=   
\frac{\vG(k + p_0 n + a_0) \vG(k-(q_1-p_0) n+a_0-b_1+1) 
\vG(k-(q_2-p_0) n+a_0-b_2+1)}{\vG(k+1) \vG(k+(p_0-p_1) n+a_0-a_1+1) 
\vG(k+(p_0-p_2) n+ a_0-a_2+1)}.  
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%% 
We remark that the current $g(n)$ corresponds to the sequence 
$g_0(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:gi(n)}, not to $g(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:gg(n)}. 
In general a gamma factor $\vG(\sigma k + \lambda n + \alpha)$ is said 
to be {\sl positive} resp. {\sl negative} on an interval of $k$, if 
$\sigma k + \lambda n$ is positive resp. negative whenever 
$k$ lies in that interval.   
Since $\bp \in \cS(\Z)$, all lower and an upper gamma factors of 
$\varphi(k; n)$ are positive in $k > 0$, while the remaining two upper 
factors changes their signs when $k$ goes across $(q_1-p_0) n$ or 
$(q_2-p_0) n$.    
Thus it is natural to make a decomposition $g(n) = g_1(n) + g_2(n) + g_2(n)$ 
with  
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
g_1(n) := \sum_{k=0}^{(q_1-p_0) n-1} \varphi(k; n), 
\quad 
g_2(n) :=\sum_{k=(q_1-p_0) n}^{(q_2-p_0) n-1} \varphi(k; n), 
\quad 
g_3(n) :=\sum_{k=(q_2-p_0) n}^{\infty} \varphi(k; n),    
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%
where if $q_1 = q_2$ then $g_2(n)$ should be null so 
we always assume $q_1 < q_2$ when discussing $g_2(n)$. 
It turns out that the first component $g_1(n)$ is 
the most dominant among the three, yielding the leading 
asymptotics for $g(n)$.   
The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:ds} is completed at the end 
of \S\ref{subsec:3rd}.   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% subsec:1st %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsection{First Component} \label{subsec:1st}

For the first component $g_1(n)$, applying Euler's reflection formula 
for the gamma function to the two negative gamma factors in the 
numerator of $\varphi(k; n)$, we have  
%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%  
Under the assumption of Theorem \ref{thm:ds} the sum $G_1(n)$ 
satisfies all conditions in Theorem \ref{thm:dspm}.   
Indeed, balancedness \eqref{eqn:ap-bq2} follows from $s(\bp) = 0$; 
boundedness \eqref{eqn:bdd} is trivial because $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_j$ 
are independent of $n$; admissibility \eqref{eqn:ap-bq1} is fulfilled   
with $r_0 = 0$ and $r_1 = L_1$ due to condition \eqref{eqn:bp};  
genericness \eqref{eqn:punc} is trivial since $I_0 \cup I_1 = \emptyset$ 
with $J_0 = \{1\}$ and $J_1 = \{4\}$ by inequalities in \eqref{eqn:bp}.  
To verify properness \eqref{eqn:max}, notice that the characteristic 
equation \eqref{eqn:max-eq} now reads    
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\chi_1(x) = \dfrac{x(x+p_0-p_1)(x+p_0-p_2)}{(-x+q_1-p_0)(-x+q_2-p_0)} - (x+p_0) = 0.   
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%
Thanks to $s(\bp) = 0$ this equation reduces to a linear equation in $x$ 
having the unique root   
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
x_0 = \frac{p_0(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0)}{p_1 p_2-(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0)}  
= \frac{p_0(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0)}{s_2(\bp)},  
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%
where $s(\bp) = 0$ again leads to $s_2(\bp) = 
p_1 p_2-(q_1-p_0)(q_2-p_0)$, which together with \eqref{eqn:bp} 
yields $s(\bp) -p_0(q_2-p_0) = (q_1-p_1)(q_1-p_2) > 0$ and hence   
$s_2(\bp) > p_0(q_2-p_0) > 0$, that is,  
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[ 
0 < x_0 < L_1 = q_1 - p_0. 
\]
%%%%%%%%%%% 
If $\phi_1(x)$ is the additive phase function for $G_1(n)$ then 
it follows from \eqref{eqn:dash2} and \eqref{eqn:bp} that     
%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
\phi_1''(x_0) &= 
\frac{1}{x_0} + \frac{1}{x_0+p_0-p_1} + \frac{1}{x+p_0-p_2} + 
\frac{1}{q_1-p_0-x_0} +  \frac{1}{q_2-p_0-x_0} - \frac{1}{x_0+p_0} \\[2mm]
&= \frac{s_2(\bp)^4}{p_0 p_1 p_2 \prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 (q_j-p_i)} > 0. 
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%
Thus in the interval $0 < x < L_1$ the function $\phi_1(x)$ has only one 
local and hence global minimum at $x = x_0$, which is non-degenerate.  
Therefore properness \eqref{eqn:max} is satisfied with $\Mm = \{x_0 \}$ 
and hence Theorem \ref{thm:dspm} applies to the sum $G_1(n)$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% lem:1st %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}.   
Substituting $x = x_0$ into formulas \eqref{eqn:G-asymp2} and 
using $s(\bp) = 0$ repeatedly, one has  
%%%%%%%%%%
\[
(\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}} = \Phi_1(x_0)

s_2(\bp)^{s(\sba) + 1}}{(2 \pi)^2 \prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 (q_j-p_i)^{b_j-a_i}}, 
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%
while $\gamma_1 := \gamma(n)$ in definition \eqref{eqn:ga(n)} now reads 
$\gamma_1 = - s(\ba) - 1$.  
Since $\delta_0(n) = \delta_1(n) = 1$ in \eqref{eqn:uniform} by 
$I_0 \cup I_1 = \emptyset$, formula \eqref{eqn:dspm} in 
Theorem \ref{thm:dspm} implies that

%%%%%%%%%% 
In view of the relation between $G_1(n)$ and $g_1(n)$ the above 
asymptotic formula for $G_1(n)$ gives the one for 
$g_1(n)$.  
Finally $|D(\bp)| > 1$ follows from 
Lemma \ref{lem:Phi1(0)} below. \hfill $\Box$ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% lem:Phi1(0) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:Phi1(0)} 
Under condition \eqref{eqn:bp} one has  
$|D(\bp) | = (\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}} > \Phi_1(0) > 1$. 
\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
First, $|D(\bp)| = (\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}}$ is obvious from the definition 
\eqref{eqn:A(p)} of $D(\bp)$ and the expression for 
$(\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}}$, while $(\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}} > \Phi_1(0)$ 
is also clear from $\Mm = \{ x_0 \}$.   
Regarding $\bp = (p_0,p_1,p_2; q_1, q_2)$ as real variables 
subject to the linear relation $s(\bp) = 0$ and ranging over the 
closure of the domain \eqref{eqn:bp}, we shall find the minimum of  
%%%%%
\[
\Phi_1(0) = \frac{p_0^{p_0}}{(p_0-p_1)^{p_0-p_1} (p_0-p_2)^{p_0-p_2}
(q_1-p_0)^{q_1-p_0}(q_2-p_0)^{q_2-p_0}}.  
\]
%%%%%
For any fixed $(p_0, p_1, p_2)$, due to the constraint $s(\bp) = 0$, 
one can thought of $\Phi_1(0)$ as a function of single variable $q_1$ 
in the interval $p_0 \le q_1 \le p_1 + p_2$. 
Differentiation with respect to $q_1$ shows that $\Phi_1(0)$ attains  
its minimum (only) at the endpoints $q_1 = p_0$, $p_1+p_2$, 
whose value is   
%%%%%%
\[ 
\Psi(p_0, p_1, p_2) :=  
\frac{p_0^{p_0}}{(p_0-p_1)^{p_0-p_1} (p_0-p_2)^{p_0-p_2}
(p_1+p_2-p_0)^{p_1+p_2-p_0}}.   
\]

so $\Phi_1(0) > \Psi(p_0, p_1, p_2)$ for any $p_0 < q_1 < p_1+p_2$. 
With a fixed $p_0 > 0$ we think of $\Psi(p_0, p_1, p_2)$ as a function of 
$(p_1, p_2)$ in the closed simplex $p_0 \le p_1 + p_2$, $p_1 \le p_0$, 
$p_2 \le p_0$. 
It has a unique critical value $\Psi(p_0, 2 p_0/3, 2 p_0/3) = 3^{p_0} > 1$ 
in the interior of the simplex, while on its boundary one has 
$\Psi(p_0, \alpha, p_0)  = 
\Psi(p_0, p_0, \alpha)=  \Psi(p_0, \alpha, p_0-\alpha) = p_0^{p_0} 
\alpha^{-\alpha} (p_0-\alpha)^{\alpha-p_0} \ge 1$ for any 
$0 \le \alpha \le p_0$.  
Therefore we have $\Phi_1(0) > \Psi(p_0, p_1, p_2) \ge 1$

Rewriting $k \mapsto 2 k$ or $k \mapsto 2 k+1$ according as $k$ is even or odd,

Obviously, $G_{20}(n)$ and $G_{21}(n)$ have the same multiplicative 
phase function, which we denote by $\Phi_2(x)$. 
Let $\phi_2(x) := - \log \Phi_2(x)$ be the associated additive phase function. 
In order to make the second component $g_2(n)$ weaker than the 
first one $g_1(n)$, we want to make $\phi_2'(x) \ge 0$ or equivalently 
$\chi_2(x) \ge 0$ for every $0 \le x \le L_2/2$, where $\chi_2(x)$ is

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:2nd} 
Under the assumption of Lemma $\ref{lem:1st}$, if $\bp$ satisfies the 
additional condition \eqref{eqn:chi2} then there exist positive constants  
$0 < d_2 < |D(\bp)|$, $C_2 > 0$ and $N_2 \in \N$ such that 
%%%%%
\[
|t(\ba) \cdot g_2(n)| \le C_2 \cdot d_2^n,  
\qquad {}^{\forall} n \ge N_2, \, \, {}^{\forall}\ba \in \A(R, \sigma).   
\]
%%%%%
\end{lemma} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
Condition \eqref{eqn:chi2} implies that $\Phi_2(x)$ is decreasing 
everywhere in $0 \le x \le L_2/2$ and is strictly so near 
$x = 0$ since $\chi(0; \bp) = (q_1-p_0)(q_1-p_1)(q_1-p_2) > 0$ by 
condition \eqref{eqn:bp}.  
Hence $\Phi_2(x)$ attains its maximum (only) at the left end 
$x = 0$ of the interval, having the value  
%%%%%%
\[
(\Phi_2)_{\mathrm{max}} 
= \Phi_2(0) = \frac{q_1^{q_1}}{(q_1-p_0)^{q_1-p_0} (q_1-p_1)^{q_1-p_1}
(q_1-p_2)^{q_1-p_2}(q_2-q_1)^{q_2-q_1}}  
= \Phi_1(L_1).  
\]
%%%%% 
whereas $(\Phi_2)_{\mathrm{max}} = \Phi_1(L_1) < (\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}} 
= |D(\bp)|$ follows from Lemma \ref{lem:Phi1(0)}. 
Thus if $d_2$ is any number such that $(\Phi_2)_{\mathrm{max}} 
< d_2 < |D(\bp)|$, then Proposition \ref{prop:irregular} shows that 
%%%%%%
\[
|G_{2\nu}(n)| \le \dfrac{K_2 \cdot d_2^n}{ \min \{1, \, 
\mathrm{dist}(b_1-a_0, \, \Z_{\ge \nu+1}) \}} 
\le \dfrac{K_2 \cdot d_2^n}{\delta(b_1-a_0)}, 
\quad {}^{\forall} n \ge N_2, \,\, \nu = 0, 1,  
\]
%%%%%% 
for some $K_2 > 0$ and $N_2 \in \N$, where $\delta(z) := \min \{ 1, \, 
\mathrm{dist}(z, \, \N)\}$ for $z \in \C$.  
%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%
We have to take care of $H_2(n)$ when $L_2$ and $n$ are both odd. 
Stirling's formula \eqref{eqn:stirling} yields 
%%%%%%
\[
H_2(n) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \cdot \frac{\prod_{i=1}^2 
(\sigma_i L_2 + \lambda_i)^{\alpha_i- \frac{1}{2}} }{ \prod_{j=1}^4 
(\tau_j L_2 + \mu_j)^{\beta_j - \frac{1}{2} } } 
\cdot \Phi_2(L_2/2)^n \cdot n^{\gamma_2} \cdot \{1 + O(1/n) \} 
\quad \mbox{as} \quad n \to +\infty, 
\]
%%%%%%
where $\gamma_2 := \alpha_1+\alpha_2-\beta_1-\beta_2-\beta_3-\beta_4+1$. 
Since $\Phi_2(L_2/2) < (\Phi_2)_{\mathrm{max}} < d_2$, upon retaking $K_2 > 0$ 
suitably, one has $|H_2(n)| \le K_2 \cdot d_2^n \le K_2 \cdot 
d_2^n/ \delta(b_1-a_0)$ for any $n \ge N_2$.  
%%%%%
\par
%%%%%
Then from the relation between $g_2(n)$ and 
$G_2(n) = G_{20}(n)-G_{21}(n) + H_2(n)$ one has   
%%%%%%
\[
|t(\ba) \cdot g_2(n) | \le 3 \pi K_2 \cdot M_2(\ba) \cdot d_2^n  
\quad \mbox{with} \quad  
M_2(\ba) := \dfrac{|\sin \pi(b_1-a_0)|}{\delta(b_1-a_0)}.

%%%%%
Since $M_2(\ba)$ is bounded for $\ba \in \A(R, \sigma)$ the lemma 
follows (here $\sigma$ is irrelevant). \hfill $\Box$ \par\medskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Lemma \ref{lem:2nd} tempts us to ask when condition \eqref{eqn:chi2} 
is satisfied.   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% lem:key %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}  \label{lem:key} 
For any $\bp \in \cS(\R)$ condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key} implies 
condition \eqref{eqn:chi2}.  
\end{lemma} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}. 
We use the following general fact. 
Let $\chi(x)$ be a real cubic polynomial with positive leading coefficient 
and $\vD$ be its discriminant. 
If $\vD < 0$ then $\chi(x)$ has only one real root so that once 
$\chi(c_0) > 0$ for some $c_0 \in \R$ then $\chi(x) > 0$ for every 
$x \ge c_0$. 
Even if $\vD = 0$, once $\chi(c_0) > 0$ then $\chi(x) \ge 0$ for every  
$x \ge c_0$ with possible equality $\chi(c_1) = 0$, $c_1 > c_0$,  
only if $\chi(x)$ attains a local minimum at $x = c_1$. 
Currently, $\chi(x; \bp)$ has discriminant $\vD(\bp)$ in formula 
\eqref{eqn:v(p)} and $\chi(0; \bp) = (q_1-p_0)(q_1-p_1)(q_1-p_2) > 0$ by 
condition \eqref{eqn:bp}.   
Thus if $\vD(\bp) \le 0$ then $\chi(x; \bp) \ge 0$ for every $x \ge 0$; 
this is just the case (a) in condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key}.  
%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%
We proceed to the case (b) in \eqref{eqn:cond-key}. 
The derivative of $\chi(x; \bp)$ in $x$ is given by 
%%%%%%
\[
\chi'(x; \bp) = 6 x^2 +4 (2 q_1-q_2) x
+ (3 q_1-p_1-p_2)(p_1+p_2-q_2)  + 2 q_1^2 -2 (p_1+p_2) q_1 + p_1 p_2.  
\]
%%%%%%
Note that $2 q_1 - q_2$, $3 q_1-p_1-p_2$, $p_1+p_2-q_2 > 0$ 
by condition \eqref{eqn:bp}. 
Having axis of symmetry $x = -(2 q_1-q_2)/3 < 0$, the 
quadratic function $\chi'(x; \bp)$ is increasing in $x \ge 0$ and hence    
%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
\chi'(x; \bp) \ge \chi'(0; \bp) 
&= (3 q_1-p_1-p_2)(p_1+p_2-q_2)  + 2 q_1^2 -2 (p_1+p_2) q_1 + p_1 p_2 \\[1mm]
&> 2 q_1^2 -2 (p_1+p_2) q_1 + p_1 p_2 \ge 0 
\qquad \mbox{for any} \quad x \ge 0,  
\end{align*}
%%%%%%
where the last inequality stems from (b) in condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key}.  
Thus $\chi(x; \bp) \ge \chi(0; \bp) > 0$ for any $x \ge 0$, so condition 
\eqref{eqn:chi2} is satisfied. \hfill $\Box$ \par\medskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The converse to the implication in Lemma \ref{lem:key} is also true, 
accordingly conditions \eqref{eqn:cond-key} and \eqref{eqn:chi2} are 
equivalent for any $\bp \in \cS(\R)$, but the proof of this fact is omitted 
as it is not needed in this article.  
In the situation of Lemma \ref{lem:2nd} we proceed to the third component.

For the third component $g_3(n)$, taking the shift 
$k \mapsto k+(q_2-p_0)n$ in $\varphi(k; n)$, one has

\vG(\sigma_i k+ \lambda_i n+ \alpha_i)}{\prod_{j=1}^3
\vG(\tau_j k+ \mu_j n +\beta_j)},

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 = \sigma_3 = \tau_1 = \tau_2 = \tau_3 = 1$ and 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{alignat*}{6}
\lambda_1 &= q_2, \quad & \lambda_2 &= q_2-q_1, \quad & \lambda_3 &= 0, \quad &

\end{alignat*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%
It is easy to see that $g_3(n)$ satisfies balancedness 
\eqref{eqn:ap-bq2}, boundedness \eqref{eqn:bdd}, admissibility 
\eqref{eqn:ap-bq1} with $r_0 = 0$ and $r_1 = +\infty$.  
Notice that $I_0 = \{3 \}$ if $q_1 < q_2$ and $I_0 = \{2, 3\}$ if 
$q_1 = q_2$, while $I_1 = J_0 = J_1 = \emptyset$. 
Genericness \eqref{eqn:punc} becomes $b_2-a_0 \not \in \N$ if $q_1 < q_2$,  
and $b_1-a_0$, $b_2-a_0 \not \in \N$ if $q_1 = q_2$.  
Continuity at infinity \eqref{eqn:infty} is satisfied with   
$\bsigma^{\sbsigma} = \btau^{\sbtau} = 1$; convergence 
condition \eqref{eqn:conv} is equivalent to $\rRe \, s(\ba) \ge \sigma$.  
Under the assumption of Lemma $\ref{lem:2nd}$ we have the following. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% lem:3rd %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:3rd} 
There exist positive constants $0 < d_3 < |D(\bp)|$, $C_3 > 0$ and 
$N_3 \in \N$ such that 
%%%%%
\[
|t(\ba) \cdot g_3(n)| \le C_3 \cdot d_3^n, 
\qquad {}^{\forall} n \ge N_3, \, \, {}^{\forall}\ba \in \A(R, \sigma).   
\]
%%%%%
\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof}.  
In view of $s(\bp) = 0$ the characteristic function 
\eqref{eqn:max-eq} for $g_3(n)$ is given by 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
\chi_3(x) 
&= (x+q_2-p_0)(x+q_2-p_1)(x+q_2-p_2) - (x+q_2)(x+q_2-q_1)x \\
&= s(\bp) \, x^2 + \{ 2 s(\bp) \, q_2 + s_2(\bp) \} x 
+ (q_2-p_0)(q_2-p_1)(q_2-p_2) \\
&= s_2(\bp) \, x + (q_2-p_0)(q_2-p_1)(q_2-p_2).  
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
Since $s_2(\bp) > 0$ and $(q_2-p_0)(q_2-p_1)(q_2-p_2) > 0$ from 
condition \eqref{eqn:bp}, one has $\chi_3(x) > 0$ and hence the additive phase 
function $\phi_3(x)$ satisfies $\phi_3'(x) > 0$ for any $x \ge 0$.     
Thus $\Phi_3(x) = e^{-\phi_3(x)}$ is strictly decreasing in $x \ge 0$ and 
attains its maximum (only) at $x = 0$, having the value 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
(\Phi_3)_{\mathrm{max}} = \Phi_3(0) = 
\frac{q_2^{q_2} (q_2-q_1)^{q_2-q_1}}{(q_2-p_0)^{q_2-p_0} 
(q_2-p_1)^{q_2-p_1} (q_2-p_2)^{q_2-p_2}} = \Phi_2(L_2/2),        
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
whereas $(\Phi_3)_{\mathrm{max}} = \Phi_2(L_2/2) < (\Phi_2)_{\mathrm{max}} 
= \Phi_2(0) = \Phi_1(L_1) < (\Phi_1)_{\mathrm{max}} = |D(\bp)|$. 
Thus if $d_3$ is any number with $(\Phi_3)_{\mathrm{max}} < d_3 < |D(\bp)|$ 
then Proposition \ref{prop:irregular} implies that for any $n \ge N_3$, 
%%%%%%
\[
|g_3(n)| \le \frac{K_3 \cdot d_3^n}{\delta(b_2-a_0)} \quad \mbox{if} \quad q_1 < q_2; 
\qquad 
|g_3(n)| \le \frac{K_3 \cdot d_3^n}{\delta(b_1-a_0) \cdot \delta(b_2-a_0)} 
\quad \mbox{if} \quad q_1 = q_2,   
\]
%%%%%
where the function $\delta(z)$ is defined in the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:2nd}. 
Since $\sin \pi(b_j-a_0) / \delta(b_j-a_0)$, $j = 1, 2$, are bounded 
for $\ba \in \A(R, \sigma)$, the lemma follows immediately.  
\hfill $\Box$ \par\medskip

Theorem \ref{thm:ds} is now an immediate consequence of Lemmas \ref{lem:1st}, 
\ref{lem:2nd}, \ref{lem:key} and \ref{lem:3rd}. 
Theorems \ref{thm:rs} and \ref{thm:ds} then imply that  if  the shift vector

\subsection{Error Estimates} \label{subsec:error}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We are now in a position to establish our main results in \S \ref{subsec:mrcf} by 
means of the general estimate \eqref{eqn:error} upon putting $X(n) = f(n)$ and 
$Y(n) = g(n)$. 
In this subsection, unless otherwise mentioned explicitly, Landau's symbols 
$O(\, \cdot \,)$ are uniform in any compact subset of 
%%%%%%%%%
\[
\A := \{ \ba \in \C^5 \,:\, \rRe \, s(\ba) > 0\}. 
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof of thm:cf-straight %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof of Theorem $\ref{thm:cf-straight}$}. 
In the straight case in Definition \ref{def:admissible} the sequences in 
\eqref{eqn:f(n)} and \eqref{eqn:gg(n)} are given by 
$f(n) = {}_3f_2(\ba + n \bk)$ and $g(n) = {}_3g_2(\ba + n \bk)$ respectively.  
Under the assumption of Theorem \ref{thm:cf-straight} we can use   
Theorems \ref{thm:rs} and \ref{thm:ds} with $\bp$ replaced by $\bk$ 
to get    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
f(n) &= {}_3f_2(\ba + n \bk) = \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot s_2(\bk)^{-s(\sba)} \cdot 
n^{-2 s(\sba)} \cdot \{1 + O(1/n) \}, \\[1mm]
g(n) &= {}_3g_2(\ba + n \bk) = \dfrac{B(\ba; \bk)}{t(\ba)} \cdot D(\bk)^n \cdot 
n^{-s(\sba)-\frac{1}{2} } \cdot \left\{ 1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\},  
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $D(\bk)$, $t(\ba)$ and $B(\ba; \bk)$ are given by \eqref{eqn:A(p)} and 
\eqref{eqn:B(a;p)} with $\bp$ replaced by $\bk$, and hence 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
R(n) = \frac{f(n+2)}{g(n+2)} = 
\dfrac{ t(\ba) \cdot \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot s_2(\bk)^{-s(\sba)}}{ B(\ba; \bk) \cdot D(\bk)^2 } 
\cdot D(\bk)^{-n} \cdot n^{-s(\sba)+ \frac{1}{2} } \cdot 
\left\{1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}) \right\}.  
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%
Combining this formula with \eqref{eqn:casorati} in Theorem 
\ref{thm:casorati}, we have  
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\omega(0) \, R(n) = \rho(\ba; \bk) \cdot e_{\rs}(\ba; \bk) \cdot 
\gamma(\ba; \bk) \cdot D(\bk)^{-n} \cdot n^{-s(\sba) + \frac{1}{2} } 
\cdot \left\{1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\}, 
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $e_{\rs}(\ba; \bk)$ and $\gamma(\ba; \bk)$ are defined in  
\eqref{eqn:es(a;k)} and \eqref{eqn:gamma(a)}. 
To cope with the error term in formula \eqref{eqn:error}, we also need to 
care about how $R(n) \cdot Y(0)/ X(0)$ depends on $\ba \in \A$.  
Observe that  
%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{gather*}
\frac{R(n) \cdot Y(0)}{X(0)} = \frac{R(n) \cdot {}_3g_2(\ba)}{{}_3f_2(\ba)} = 
\psi_1(\ba) \cdot \psi_2(\ba) 
\cdot D(\bk)^{-n} \cdot n^{-s(\sba) + \frac{1}{2}} \cdot 
\left\{ 1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\}, \\ 
\mbox{with} \quad 
\psi_1(\ba) := \frac{\vG(s(\ba)) \cdot s_2(\bk)^{-s(\sba)}}{B(\ba; \bk) 
\cdot D(\bk)^2},  \quad  
\psi_2(\ba) := \frac{t(\ba) \cdot {}_3g_2(\ba)}{{}_3f_2(\ba)}.     
\end{gather*}
%%%%%%%%%%% 
It is obvious that $\psi_1(\ba)$ is holomorphic in $\A$. 
It is also easy to see that $\psi_2(\ba)$ is holomorphic in 
$\A_0 := \{\ba \in \A : {}_3f_2(\ba) \neq 0 \}$. 
Indeed ${}_3g_2(\ba)$ has a pole when $a_0-b_1+1 \in \Z_{\le 0}$ or 
$a_0-b_2+1 \in \Z_{\le 0}$ but the pole is canceled by a zero of $t(\ba) = 
\sin \pi(b_1-a_0) \cdot \sin \pi(b_2-a_0)$; similarly ${}_3g_2(\ba)$ has a 
pole when $a_0 \in \Z_{\le 0}$ but it is canceled by a pole of 
${}_3f_2(\ba)$.         
Now estimate \eqref{eqn:error} leads to asymptotic formula 
\eqref{eqn:cf-straight}, in which Landau's symbol is uniform in 
any compact subset of $\A_0$. \hfill $\Box$ 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end proof %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par\medskip\noindent
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin proof of thm:cf-cyclic %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\it Proof of Theorem $\ref{thm:cf-cyclic}$}. 
In the twisted case in Definition \ref{def:admissible}, 
if $n = 3 m + i$, $m \in \Z_{\ge0}$, $i = 0, 1, 2$, then the sequences $f(n)$ 
in \eqref{eqn:f(n)} and $g(n)$ in \eqref{eqn:gg(n)} are given by  
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
f(3 m + i) = {}_3f_2(\ba + \bj_i + m \bp), \qquad 
g(3 m + i) = {}_3g_2(\ba + \bj_i + m \bp),  
\] 
%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\bj_0 = \0$, $\bj_1 = \bk$, $\bj_2 = \bl$ and $\bp$ is the 
shift vector in formula \eqref{eqn:adm-kp}.  
%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%
Observe that $\bp$ belongs to $\cS(\Z)$ and satisfies condition 
\eqref{eqn:cond-key},  if and only if the seed vector $\bk \in \Z^5$ 
fulfills condition \eqref{eqn:cond-cyclic}.  
Indeed, since $p_0 = p_1 = p_2 = l_1+l_2$, $q_1 = 3 l_1$ and $q_2 = 3 l_2$, the 
inequalities in \eqref{eqn:bp} becomes 
$l_1 + l_2 < 3 l_1 \le 3 l_2 < 2(l_1 + l_2)$, which is equivalent to $l_1 \le l_2 < 2 l_1$. 
Case (a) in condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key} now reads 
%%%%%%%
$\vD(\bp) = -27(l_2^2-4 l_1 l_2 + l_1^2) (l_2^2+2 l_1 l_2 -2l_1^2) 
(2 l_2^2 -2l_1 l_2-l_1^2) \le 0$,  
%%%%%%% 
which together with $l_1 \le l_2 < 2 l_1$ yields $l_1 \le l_2 \le \tau l_1$ in condition 
\eqref{eqn:cond-cyclic}, where $\tau = (1+\sqrt{3})/2$.    
On the other hand, case (b) in condition \eqref{eqn:cond-key} becomes   
$l_2^2 - 10 l_1 l_2 + 7 l_1^2 \ge 0$, that is, $l_2 \le (5-3 \sqrt{2}) l_1$ or 
$l_2 \ge (5 + 3\sqrt{2}) l_1$, but neither of which is possible when 
$l_1 \le l_2 < 2 l_1$.  
%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%%
Thus under the assumption of Theorem \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} one can apply  
Theorems \ref{thm:rs} and \ref{thm:ds} to the shift vector $\bp$ in 
\eqref{eqn:adm-kp} with $\ba$ replaced by $\ba+\bj_i$ to obtain    
%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{align*}
f(3 m + i) &= {}_3f_2(\ba + \bj_i + m \bp) = \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot s_2(\bp)^{-s(\sba)} 
\cdot m^{-2 s(\sba)} \cdot \{ 1 + O(1/m)\},  \\[1mm]  
g(3 m + i) &=  {}_3g_2(\ba + \bj_i + m \bp) = 
\dfrac{B(\ba + \bj_i ; \bp)}{t(\ba + \bj_i)} \cdot D(\bp)^m 
\cdot m^{-s(\sba)-\frac{1}{2}} 
\cdot  \left\{ 1 + O(m^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\},   
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%% 
where $s(\bj_i) = 0$ is also used. 
Substituting the settings \eqref{eqn:adm-kp} and \eqref{eqn:cyclic} into 
definitions \eqref{eqn:A(p)} and \eqref{eqn:B(a;p)} and taking $s(\bk) = 0$ 
into account, one has $D(\bp) = E(l_1, l_2)^3$ and  
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
t(\ba + \bj_i) = (-1)^{i(l_1+l_2)} \cdot t(\ba), \quad 
B(\ba+ \bj_i; \bp) = (-1)^{i (l_1+l_2)} \cdot 
B(\ba; \bp) \cdot E(l_1, l_2)^i, \quad i = 0, 1, 2,   
\]
%%%%%%%%%%
where $E(l_1, l_2)$ is defined in \eqref{eqn:A(l1,l2)}.  
These formulas and $s_2(\bp) = 3 (l_1^2 -l_1l_2+l_2^2)$ lead to 
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
f(n) 
&=  3^{s(\sba)} \cdot \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot (l_1^2 -l_1 l_2 + l_2^2)^{-s(\sba)}\cdot  
n^{-2 s(\sba)} \cdot \{1 + O(1/n)\},  \\[1mm]  
g(n) &= 3^{s(\sba)+ \frac{1}{2} } \cdot \frac{B(\ba; \bp)}{t(\ba)} 
\cdot E(l_1, l_2)^n \cdot n^{-s(\sba)- \frac{1}{2} } \cdot 
\left\{ 1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}}) \right\},   
\end{align*}
%%%%%%%%%%%
so the ratio $R(n) = f(n+2)/g(n+2)$ is estimated as 
%%%%%%%%%%
\[
R(n) = \dfrac{ t(\ba) \cdot \vG(s(\ba)) \cdot 
(l_1^2-l_1l_2+l_2^2)^{-s(\sba)} }{ 3^{\frac{1}{2} } \cdot 
B(\ba; \bp) \cdot E(l_1, l_2)^2} \cdot 
E(l_1, l_2)^{-n} \cdot n^{-s(\sba)+ \frac{1}{2} } \cdot 
\left\{1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\}.  
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%
\par
%%%%%%%%%%%
Substituting $\bp = (l_1+l_2, l_1+l_2, l_1+l_2; 3l_1, 3l_2)$ into definition 
\eqref{eqn:B(a;p)} yields 
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
B(\ba; \bp) = 
\dfrac{\pi^{ \frac{1}{2} } (l_1+l_2)^{a_0+a_1+a_2- \frac{3}{2} } \cdot 3^{s(\sba)-1} 
\cdot (l_1^2-l_1l_2+l_2^2)^{s(\sba)-1}}{2^{ \frac{3}{2} } \cdot 
(2l_1-l_2)^{2 b_1-b_2+s(\sba)- \frac{3}{2} } 
(2l_2-l_1)^{2 b_2-b_1+s(\sba)-\frac{3}{2} }},  
\]
%%%%%%%%%%
which is put together with formula \eqref{eqn:casorati} in Theorem \ref{thm:casorati} 
to give   
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
\omega(0) \, R(n) = \rho(\ba; \bk) \cdot e_{\rt}(\ba; \bk) \cdot \gamma(\ba; \bk) 
\cdot E(l_1, l_2)^{-n} \cdot n^{-s(\sba) + \frac{1}{2} } \cdot 
\left\{1 + O(n^{-\frac{1}{2} }) \right\}, 
\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $e_{\rt}(\ba; \bk)$ and $\gamma(\ba; \bk)$ are given in 
\eqref{eqn:ec(a;k)} and \eqref{eqn:gamma(a)}.  
The treatment of $R(n) \cdot Y(0)/X(0)$ is similar to the one in the straight case 
and the estimate \eqref{eqn:error} leads to  asymptotic formula 
\eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic}, in which Landau's symbol is uniform in any compact

Take an index $\lambda \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ such that $k_{\lambda} > 0$

For any nonzero vector $\bk \in \Z_{\ge0}^5$ with $s(\bk) =0$ such an

The specialization is indeed well defined. 
It follows from \cite[Proposition 4.9]{EI} and Lemma \ref{lem:factorial} that 
for any $\bc \in \Q^5$ the restriction 
$\rho(\ba+\bc; \bk) \big|_{a_0 = a_1 = a_2 = 0}$ is a nonzero polynomial in 
$\Q[b_1, b_2]$ and hence $\rho(\ba+\bc; \bk)|_{a_{\lambda} = 0}$ is a 
nonzero polynomial in $\Q[a_{\mu}, a_{\nu}, b_1, b_2]$. 
This is also the case for $\sigma(\bk)$ and $\bl$ in place of $\bk$ in 
\S \ref{subsec:types}. 
Thus formula \eqref{eqn:uv2u} implies that the specialization for $q^*(0)$, 
%%%%%%
\[
\hat{q}(0) := \lim_{a_{\lambda} \to 0} u(\ba) \prod_{i=0}^2 (a_i; \, k_i) 
\quad \mbox{followed by} \quad a_i \mapsto a_i - k_i, \,\, 
b_j \mapsto b_j - l_j, \quad i = \mu, \nu, \,\, j = 1, 2,    
\] 
%%%%%
is well defined and the ensuing $\hat{q}(0)$ is a nontrivial rational function 
in $\Q(a_{\mu}, a_{\nu}, b_1, b_2)$. 
In a similar manner formula \eqref{eqn:uv2v} tells us that the specialization 
for $r^*(1)$, that is, $\hat{r}(1) \in \Q(a_{\mu}, a_{\nu}, b_1, b_2)$ is  
well defined and nontrivial. 
The specialization for $q^*(n)$ with $n \ge 1$ is also well defined,  
since $q^*(n) = q(n)$ is of the form ${}^{\sigma^i} \! u(\ba + \bc)$, where 
$i \in \{0,1,2\}$ and $\bc$ is a vector in $\Z_{\ge 0}^5$ whose 
$\lambda$-th upper component, say $c_{\lambda}$, is positive, in which case 
one can take $\lim_{a_{\lambda} \to 0} {}^{\sigma^i} \! u(\ba + \bc)$ 
without trouble, because the critical factorial 
$(a_{\lambda}; \, k_{\lambda}) \to 0$ in the denominator of 
\eqref{eqn:uv2u} is now replaced by a safe one 
$(a_{\lambda}+ c_{\lambda}; \, k_{\lambda}) \to 
(c_{\lambda}; \, k_{\lambda}) \neq 0$. 
The resulting $\hat{q}(n)$ is nontrivial in $\Q(a_{\mu}, a_{\nu}, b_1, b_2)$.  
A similar argument can be made for $\hat{r}(n)$ with $n \ge 2$. 
Thus the procedure of specialization is well defined over the rational function 
field $\Q(a_{\mu}, a_{\nu}, b_1, b_2)$.

\section{Some Examples} \label{sec:example} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To illustrate Theorems \ref{thm:cf-straight} and \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} we 
present a couple of the simplest examples.          
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ex:1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example} \label{ex:1} 
The simplest example of twisted type is given by  
%%%%%%
\[
\bk = \begin{pmatrix} 1, & 1, & 0 \\ & 1, & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad 
\bl = \begin{pmatrix} 1, & 2, & 1 \\ & 2, & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad 
\bp = \begin{pmatrix} 2, & 2, & 2 \\ & 3, & 3 \end{pmatrix},   
\]
%%%%%%
together with $\sigma(a_0, a_1, a_2; b_1, b_2) = (a_2, a_0, a_1; b_1, b_2)$.  
The recipe described in \S \ref{subsec:cr} readily yields   
$\rho(\ba; \bl) = b_1 b_2 - a_0 a_2$ and $\rho(\ba; \bk) = 
\rho(\ba+\bk; \sigma(\bk))  = 1$, so formula \eqref{eqn:uv2} yields   
%%%%%%%%
\[
u(\ba) = \dfrac{ b_1 b_2 - a_0 a_2}{a_0 a_1}, \qquad 
v(\ba) = -\dfrac{(b_1-a_0)(b_2-a_0)}{a_0 a_1}.      
\] 
%%%%%
\par
%%%%%
Thus the partial denominators and numerators of the continued fraction in 
Theorem \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} are given as in Table \ref{tab:pdn-ex1}, 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% tab:pdn-ex1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{table}[t]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{alignat*}{2} 
q_0(n) &:= \dfrac{(3 n+b_1)(3 n+b_2)-(2 n + a_0)(2 n+ a_2)}{(2 n + a_0)(2 n + a_1)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 0),  \\[2mm]
q_1(n) &:= \dfrac{(3 n + b_1 +1)(3 n + b_2+1)-(2 n+a_0+1)(2 n+ a_1+1)}{(2 n + a_1+1)(2 n + a_2)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 0),  \\[2mm]
q_2(n) &:= 
\dfrac{(3 n+b_1+2)(3 n+ b_2+2)-(2 n+ a_1+2)(2 n+ a_2+1)}{(2 n+a_0+1)(2 n + a_2 + 1)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 0),  \\[2mm] 
r_0(n) &:= - \dfrac{(n+b_1-a_2)(n+b_2-a_2)}{(2 n+a_0-1)(2 n+a_2-1)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 1), \\[2mm]
r_1(n) &:= - \dfrac{(n+b_1-a_0)(n+b_2-a_0)}{(2 n+a_0)(2 n+a_1)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 0),  \\[2mm]
r_2(n) &:= - \dfrac{(n+b_1-a_1)(n+b_2-a_1)}{(2 n+a_1+1)(2 n+a_2)} 
\qquad & (n &\ge 0).   
\end{alignat*}
\caption{Partial denominators and numerators in Example \ref{ex:1} with $r_0(0) := 1$.} 
\label{tab:pdn-ex1}
\end{table} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
so the continued fraction for ${}_3 f_2(\ba+\bk)/{}_3f_2(\ba)$ is well defined when 
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
a_0, \, a_1, \, a_2 \not \in \Z_{\le 0}; \qquad 
b_j -a_i \not\in \Z_{\le 0}, \quad b_j-a_2 \not\in \Z_{\le -1}, \quad  
i = 0, 1, \,\, j = 1, 2.    
\]
%%%%%%%%%%% 
In the error estimate \eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic} we have $E(l_1, l_2) = E(1,1) = 4$ and 
%%%%%%%%%%%
\[
c_{\rt}(\ba; \bk) = \dfrac{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot 
\vG(a_0) \vG(a_1) \vG(a_2) \vG^2(s(\ba))}{2^{a_0+a_1+a_2+1} \cdot 3^{s(\sba) - \frac{1}{2}} 
\prod_{j=1}^2 \prod_{i=0}^2 \vG(b_j-a_i + \delta_{i 2})}.    
\]
%%%%%%%%%%% 
\par
%%%%%%
Passing to the continued fraction for ${}_3 F_2(\ba+\bk)/{}_3F_2(\ba)$, 
we have $q_0^*(0) = b_1 b_2-a_0 a_2$, $r^*_0(0) = b_1 b_2$,  
$r^*_1(0) = -(b_1-a_0)(b_2-a_0)$ and $q^*_i(n) = q_i(n)$, $r^*_i(n) = r_i(n)$ 
for all other $(i, n)$ in formula \eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic-o}.   
The $0$-th specialization of \eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic-o} then leads to 
$\hat{q}_0(0) = \hat{r}_0(0) = (b_1-1)(b_2-1)$, $\hat{r}_1(0) = -(b_1-1)(b_2-1)$ 
in formula \eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic-s} while all other $\hat{q}_i(n)$ and 
$\hat{r}_i(n)$ are given as in Table \ref{tab:pdn-cf}, where circumflex 
``$\hat{\phantom{q}}$'' is deleted for the sake of simplicity. 
Clearly we can make $\hat{q}_0(0) = \hat{r}_0(0) = 1$, $\hat{r}_1(0) = -1$ 
up to equivalence of continued fractions and we have established      
Theorem \ref{thm:ete-i}. 
\end{example}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ex:2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{example} \label{ex:2} 
The next simplest example of twisted type is given by  
%%%%%%
\[
\bk = \begin{pmatrix} 2, & 0, & 0 \\ & 1, & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad 
\bl = \begin{pmatrix} 2, & 2, & 0 \\ & 2, & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad 
\bp = \begin{pmatrix} 2, & 2, & 2 \\ & 3, & 3 \end{pmatrix},    
\]
%%%%%% 
where $\bp$ and $\sigma$ are the same as in Example \ref{ex:1}. 
In this case the recipe in \S\ref{subsec:cr} gives 
%%%%%%
\begin{align*}
\rho(\ba; \bl) &= b_1 b_2 + a_0 a_1 - (a_2 - 1) (a_0 + a_1 + 1), \\
\rho(\ba; \bk) &= b_1 b_2 -a_1 a_2 - (a_0 + 1)(b_1+b_2 -a_1-a_2), \\ 
\rho(\ba+\bk; \sigma(\bk)) &= (b_1+1)(b_2+1)-(a_0+2)a_2-(a_1+1) (b_1+b_2-a_0-a_2).   
\end{align*}
%%%%%%
With these data the formula \eqref{eqn:uv2} yields   
%%%%%%
\[ 
u(\ba) = \frac{(b_1 - a_1) (b_2 - a_1) \cdot \rho(\ba; \bl) }{a_0 (a_0 + 1) \cdot 
\rho(\ba+\bk; \sigma(\bk)) }, \qquad 
v(\ba) = - \frac{(b_1 - a_2 + 1) (b_2 - a_2 + 1) \cdot 
\rho(\ba; \bk) }{a_0 (a_0 + 1) \cdot \rho(\ba+\bk; \sigma(\bk)) }. 
\]
%%%%%% 
In the error estimate \eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic} in Theorem \ref{thm:cf-cyclic} we have 
$E(l_1, l_2) = E(1,1) = 4$ and 
%%%%%%
\[
c_{\rt}(\ba; \bk) = 
\dfrac{\pi^{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot \rho(\ba; \bk) \cdot \vG(a_0) \vG(a_1) \vG(a_2) 
\vG^2(s(\ba))}{2^{a_0+a_1+a_2+1} \cdot 3^{s(\sba) - \frac{1}{2}} \cdot 
\prod_{j=1}^2\vG(b_j-a_0) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 \vG(b_j-a_i+1)}. 
\]
%%%%%%
The $0$-th specialization leads to a continued fraction expansion 
\eqref{eqn:cf-cyclic-s} for ${}_3F_2(2, a_1,a_2; b_1, b_2)$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example} \label{ex:3}
The simplest example of straight type is given by $\bk = (2,2,2; 3,3)$, 
$\bl = 2 \bk$ and $\bp = 3 \bk$. 
The recipe in \S \ref{subsec:cr} shows that 
$\rho(\ba; \bk) = a_0 a_1 a_2 (b_1+b_2+1) + b_1 b_2 \{s(\ba) - s_2(\ba) \}$ and   
$\rho(\ba; 2 \bk)$ is a polynomial of degree $10$ (explicit formula is omitted).  
Formula \eqref{eqn:uv3} yields 
%%%%%%
\[
u(\ba) = \dfrac{\rho(\ba; 2 \bk)}{\rho(\ba+\bk; \bk) \prod_{i=0}^2 a_i(a_i+1)},

v(\ba) = - \dfrac{\rho(\ba; \bk) 
\prod_{i=0}^2 \prod_{j=1}^2 (b_j-a_i+1)}{\rho(\ba+\bk; \bk) \prod_{i=0}^2 a_i(a_i+1)}.
