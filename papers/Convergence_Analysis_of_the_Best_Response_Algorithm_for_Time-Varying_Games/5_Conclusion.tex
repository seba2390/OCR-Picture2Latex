\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we analyzed the best response algorithm for the class of strongly monotone games. We first considered standard time-invariant games and obtained a sufficient condition under which the best response algorithm converges at an exponential rate.
%
We provided numerical experiments that showed the best response algorithm can diverge if this condition fails to hold, which indicates that the condition is tight. Subsequently, we analyzed the best response algorithm for time-varying games with evolving equilibria. We showed that the equilibrium tracking error and the dynamic regret can be bounded in terms of the variations of evolving equilibria and loss functions. 
Moreover, we provided additional numerical simulations to verify our results.
