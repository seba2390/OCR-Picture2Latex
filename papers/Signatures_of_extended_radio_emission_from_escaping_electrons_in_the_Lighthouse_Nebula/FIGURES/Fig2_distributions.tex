\caption{Energy distribution of non-thermal particles injected into the JET and ISM regions for different assumed values of the low-energy cutoff $\gamma_{\rm min}^{cut}$. Particle injection is discretized as occurring every $t_{\rm inj} = 1$~kyr (dotted lines). The final cumulative distribution at present time accounts for radiation cooling due to IC on the CMB and synchrotron losses. Distributions are shown for particles injected recently ($t_{\rm inj} \leq 1$~kyr) that diffuse through the JET region (blue lines), and particles injected at $t_{\rm inj} > 1$~kyr diffusing into the ISM region (in red lines). In both cases, a magnetic field of $B_{\rm ISM} = B_{\rm JET} = 5\mu$G is assumed. A low cutoff for the particle distribution at injection is considered, adopting two different values $\gamma_{\rm min}^{cut} = 10^{3}$  and $\gamma_{\rm min}^{cut} = 10^{5}$ (solid and dashed lines, respectively). A high energy cutoff $\gamma_{\rm max}^{cut} = 10^{8}$ is also assumed in all cases. The distribution normalization is computed accounting for the source observed X-ray luminosity (see text for details).}
