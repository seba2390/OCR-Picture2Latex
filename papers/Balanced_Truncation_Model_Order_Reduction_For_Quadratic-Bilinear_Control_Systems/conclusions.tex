In this paper, we have investigated balanced truncation model reduction for  QB control systems. We have proposed reachability and observability Gramians for QB systems based on the kernels of their underlying Volterra series.  Additionally, we have also introduced a truncated version of the Gramians. We, furthermore, have compared the controllability and observability energy functionals of the QB system with the quadratic forms of the proposed Gramians for the system and also investigated the connection between the Gramians and reachability/observability of the QB system. Also, we have discussed the advantages of the truncated version of Gramians in the MOR framework and  studied local Lyapunov stability of the reduced-order systems, obtained via the square-root balanced truncation. By means of various semi-discretized nonlinear PDEs, we have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed balanced truncation methods for QB systems and compared it with the existing moment-matching techniques.
