\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented designs and evaluations for representing communication patterns, an extensible structure, in Gantt charts as they scale up to thousands of rows, as is common in HPC. Through our preliminary experiment, we observed people's varying ideas on the concept of ``patterns'' as well as visual factors they used to interpret them. These observations led us to decompose communication patterns into three domain-specific indicators and design a visual approach for representing them in a scale-agnostic approach that maintains their ethos. A controlled study with these designs showed they enabled a more accurate identification of salient characteristics compared to large-scale views of communication patterns. This suggests applying our design strategy to other extensible patterns, such as collective communications, may prove effective. In addition to validating our new design, our evaluations confirm our concerns with scalability in Gantt charts, but also suggest further focus on making partial views responsively navigable along with scalable overviews such as ours, could clarify important aspects of communication patterns.
