% out the following line
%\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, FIRST and TGSS. This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively $30\,059$ and $11\,674$ extended sources distributed over more than $7\,000$ and $17\,000$ square degrees. 
The identification of the sources in the FIRST sample was performed in advance by volunteers of the Radio Galaxy Zoo project, while for the TGSS sample it is the result of an automated process presented here.
After taking into account systematic effects, marginal evidence of a local alignment on scales smaller than $2.5^\circ$ is found in the FIRST sample. The probability of this happening by chance is found to be less than $2$ per cent. Further study suggests that on scales up to $1.5^\circ$ the alignment is maximal. For one third of the sources, the Radio Galaxy Zoo volunteers identified an optical counterpart. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_m = 0.31, \Omega_\Lambda = 0.69$, we convert the maximum angular scale on which alignment is seen into a physical scale in the range $[19, 38]$ Mpc $h_{70}^{-1}$. This result supports recent evidence reported by Taylor and Jagannathan of radio jet alignment in the $1.4$ deg$^2$ ELAIS N1 field observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope.  The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal.
