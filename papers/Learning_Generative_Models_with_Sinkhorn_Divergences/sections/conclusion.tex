\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a new computational toolbox to train large scale generative models with the Sinkhorn divergence.
%
Thanks to the combination of entropic smoothing and automatic differentiation, it makes optimal transport applicable in arbitrary complex generative model setups.
%
Besides, we proved that this divergence interpolates between classical OT and MMD losses, benefiting from advantages of both frameworks. 
%
Future work should focus on theoretical properties of the Sinkhorn divergence, in particular sample complexity and positivity.
