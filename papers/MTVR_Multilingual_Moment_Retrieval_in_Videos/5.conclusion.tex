\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
In this work, we collect \DsetName, a new large-scale, multilingual moment retrieval dataset. 
It contains 218K queries in English and in Chinese from 21.8K video clips from 6 TV shows. 
We also propose a multilingual moment retrieval model \ModelName~as a strong baseline for the \DsetName~dataset. 
We show in experiments that \ModelName~outperforms monolingual models while using fewer parameters.
