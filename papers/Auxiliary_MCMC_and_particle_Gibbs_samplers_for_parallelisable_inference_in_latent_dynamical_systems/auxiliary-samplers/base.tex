In this section, we first review the auxiliary gradient-based samplers of \citet{titsias2018}, and then show that when the latent model consists of Gaussian dynamics, they can be reformulated in terms of the posterior distribution of an auxiliary LGSSM. This reduces their computational complexity to linear, as opposed to cubic, in the number of time steps. This perspective will serve as a building block for the rest of the methods presented in this article.
