\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

DREMS is a prototype, end-to-end solution for building and running
distributed real-time embedded applications. It contains not only a
run-time framework with a state-of-the-art operating system extended
with special features for resource, application, and network
management together with a component framework with a precisely defined
model of computation, but also a model-driven development toolchain
that assists developers and integrators in managing the development
process.

But DREMS is only a \textit{partial} prototype for a class of software
platforms outlined in the first two sections. We believe that such
software platforms are essential for implementing the next generation
of distributed real-time embedded systems. Embedded systems are not
black boxes anymore, but rather platforms with an evolving and
dynamically changing software ecosystem.
