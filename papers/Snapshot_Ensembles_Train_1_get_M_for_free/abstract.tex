Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of \emph{ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost}.
We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters.  To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules.
The resulting technique, which we refer to as \emph{Snapshot Ensembling}, is simple, yet surprisingly effective.  We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields  lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet \name{}s obtain error rates of $3.4\%$ and $17.4\%$ respectively.

%Our main observation is that we can perturb a model with large learning rate and quickly drive it to convergence at a different minimum with small learning rate. By using multiple, short training cycles, we can obtain a number of models without increasing computational overhead.
%We show different learning cycles can yield highly divergent models, with good precision. These models can then be effectively ensembled to achieve improved performance.
