\newcommand{\resultcaption}{Error rates (\%) on CIFAR and SVHN datasets. $L$ denotes the network depth and $k$ its \stepsizename{}. Results that surpasses all competing methods are {\textbf{bold}} and the overall best results are {\color{blue}\textbf{blue}}. ``+'' indicates standard data augmentation (translation and/or mirroring). $\ast$ indicates results run by ourselves. All the results of \methodnameshort{} without data augmentation (C10, C100, SVHN) are obtained using Dropout. \methodnameshort{}s achieve lower error rates while using fewer parameters than ResNet. 
Without data augmentation, \methodnameshort{} performs better by a large margin.
