We presented a simple and accurate approach for domain adaptation of semantic segmentation.
With ordinary augmentation techniques and momentum updates, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy,
yet make no sacrifice of the modest training or model complexity.
No components of our framework are strictly specialised; they build on a relatively weak and broadly applicable assumption (\cf \cref{sec:intro}).
Although this work focuses on semantic segmentation, we are keen to explore the potential of the proposed techniques for adaptation of other dense prediction tasks, such as optical flow, monocular depth, panoptic and instance segmentation, or even compositions of these multiple tasks.
