\section{Introduction}
\input{intro}

The organization of the paper is the following. In the next section, we give a brief overview of the psychological and informatics background and the phenomenon of losing the character is illustrated. The second section presents the algorithm and the operation of our benchmark program including the presentation of the first measurements followed by systematic measurements. 
Finally, we conclude our paper and show some future plans.
%Finally, the paper is ended by conclusion and acknowledgements.

\subsection{Psychological Background}
\input{psy}

It is therefore proposed to perform our benchmark test in a competitive way trying to beat friends, family members, colleagues or ourselves.

\subsection{Informatics Background}

\subsection{Losing The Character}
%We have experienced the feeling of losing the character during playing several games like for example League of Legends or Clash of Clans. 
We have experienced the feeling of losing the character during playing several games like for example 
League of Legends\footnote{\url{https://na.leagueoflegends.com}}, 
Clash of Clans\footnote{\url{http://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/}},
Clash Royale\footnote{\url{http://supercell.com/en/games/clashroyale/}},
Heroes of the Storm\footnote{\url{https://heroesofthestorm.com}}, 
Dota 2\footnote{\url{https://www.dota2.com}}, 
World of Warcraft\footnote{\url{https://worldofwarcraft.com}} 
or Cabal\footnote{\url{http://cabal.playthisgame.com}}. 


Now we share our thoughts about the phenomenon of „losing the character”, and give some examples to illustrate it from the game called League of Legends.
Basically, a match starts kind of slowly and quietly: the laners are farming, as well as the junglers in their own territory. Of course smaller fights can occur in the early stages of the game, like a 1v1 in the solo lanes, or a 3v3 in the bottom lane as both of the junglers decides to gank, but these situations are relatively easy to see through. As we head into the mid and late game, teams start fights more often with more people, even with all of them. This is what we call teamfights. These are harder to handle, 
because a lot of things can appear on our screen at the same time: the champions who participate in the fight, optionally minions or jungle monsters, and the visual effects of the spells, summoner spells, and the active or passive abilities of the items. Besides them, we see a lot of things, we still have to make sure that we fulfill our ingame role properly: position well, attack the proper target, or defend our teammates. We have to handle a lot of information at a blink of an eye, so it is completely natural, that sometimes we do not know where to look at or what to do. We can lose our own character, which can end with our death; we can lose the target character, and it can survive; or we can lose the character that we wanted to protect, thus an important member of the team can die.
This can be a short explanation of the phenomenon, which we can also call „losing the focus”.

An example ingame footage can be viewed at \url{https://youtu.be/wdy3KUm1454}, starting at 2:12.

These situations are one of the hardest parts of the game, and it is not easy to handle them well. The easiest way to prepare for them is to play a lot of games, and get experience in them. Also it can help a lot, if we think ahead before a potential teamfight, e.g. which character will be our target, who should we be afraid of, what summoner spells the enemy still has, etc. All of these things can help to execute the fights more properly.


\section{Brain Benchmarking Series 6}

\input{alg}

\subsection{First Measurements}

As concluded in our former preliminary study \cite{brainbs5}, one of the further developments of Series 5 is changing to full screen from fixed-size window. This modification affects the basic operation of the benchmark, 
so the first objective was to verify that whether the feeling of losing the character still appears correctly or not. On Windows systems there were no problems. Some experiments using default settings on Windows 10 can be seen in Fig \ref{brainbs6nb}, Fig \ref{brainbs6nab} and Fig \ref{brainbs6nabs}. But on GNU/Linux systems test subjects reported that the feeling of losing the character is not experienced. These observations will be detailed in a next section.



\input{meas}

\subsection{Logging Data}

The state of the BrainB benchmark can be saved at any time by pressing the S button but measured data is automatically saved after the test is finished. The program saves a screenshot of the display to a PNG file. For example, such a screenshot was shown in Fig \ref{brainbs6screen}. The data is saved to a text file that contains the information shown in Listing \ref{savedata}, where the most important lines are the following. 
The two time values tell the time when data is saved. The first one (in Line \ref{time1}) 
is expressed in 100 millisecond units and the second one (in Line \ref{time2}) is expressed in the form minutes:seconds. 
The noc value tells the number of characters (boxes).
The nop value tells the number of pause events initiated by the test subject.
The relation symbol in Line \ref{relation} indicates the fulfillment of our research hypothesis that 
the mean of the complexity of changing from lost to found is less than the mean of the changing found to lost.

\subsection{Known Problems with Series 6}

Despite that our benchmark is developed on Linux it is surprising that test subjects who performed it on Linux did not experience the feeling of losing the character. This problem causes the deteriorated results shown in Fig \ref{brainbs6l}. It is important to note that it has not been detected in earlier series of the application. Moreover, before Series 6, there was no Windows binary edition of BrainB program. In Series 6, changing to full screen from windowed causes the problem because Series 6  is sensitive to the different mouse sensitivity settings on Windows and Linux systems (the measurements shown in Fig  \ref{brainbs6l} were performed with a Logitech mouse with \textit{acceleration:  5/1} and \textit{threshold:  5} xset m\footnote{\url{https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xset.1.xhtml}} setting). 
A short-term solution may be to standardize the test environment used by each member 
of a given subset of test subjects. We apply this method to perform systematic measurements with Series 6 in the next section. The long-term solution will be to fine-tune the control of movements of boxes that is hardwired into the Series 6 from Series 5 at this moment.
Another possibility is to take the liberty of fine-tuning of the mouse for test subjects who thus would be able to choose their custom mouse settings in order to increase their effectiveness. This is also in well accordance with the competitive way of performing our test.  Fig \ref{brainbs6nbft} presents two measurements using custom mouse settings.

\subsection{Systematic Measurements with Series 6}

The BrainB Series 6 was measured in two groups: UDPROG and DEAC-Hackers.
The first one is a Facebook community of over 550 actual or former students of the BSc course of “High Level Programming Languages” at the University of Debrecen. 
The second one is an esport department of the University of Debrecen's Athletic Club. Participation in the BrainB Series 6 survey was voluntary in both groups. 

In the UDPROG community 33 members send back their results including the PNG screenshot and the produced text file 
within 2 days from the date of announcement (20 August 2018). 
The arithmetic mean of the final results of UDPROG participants is 4.95345. 
The mean of the number of boxes at the moment when the benchmark ends is 57.1818.
The averaged losing and finding curve for all members is shown in Fig \ref{udprogmeanFL}.
At the end of the curve the arithmetic mean values of complexity of the losing and finding events are irrelevant because the size of the sequences of losing and finding events 
are different for every participants. Fig \ref{udprognum} indicates these different sizes.

In the DEAC-Hackers community 12 esport athletes have sent back their results that can be seen in Fig \ref{deac}. 
It is important to notice that despite low sample sizes of test subjects the averaged losing and finding 
curves shown in Fig \ref{udprogmeanFL} and \ref{deacmeanFL} have already separated the losing and finding events.

\section{Conclusion}

Our research hypothesis was that 
the mean of the complexity of changing lost to found is less than the mean of the changing found to lost. 
Fig \ref{udprogmeanFL} and \ref{deacmeanFL} show the fulfillment of this hypothesis. 
It seems very well in these figures that the averaged losing and finding curve has precisely separated 
the losing and finding events. Intuitively, this result shows that we lose the character on a higher 
complexity level then we find it on a relatively lower level again. 
This simple hypothesis has been proved by the results of this study. 

In order to further strengthen the completion of our benchmark test in a competitive way in the  following versions we are going to offer to test subjects a little more 
liberty of fine-tuning the settings. The fine-tuning of mouse settings was already mentioned earlier. A further possibility is to allow using custom colors.

The next research objective will be to verify the satisfaction of Hick's law. 
To achieve this goal it is simple enough to compare the complexity of finding and losing events with the time differences 
of these. Unfortunately, the actual version of the BrainB benchmark do not record these timestamps. 
The BrainB Series 7 will contain this feature. Our long-term research goal is to further develop our benchmark to a standard psychological test that can be used for talent search in esport.
