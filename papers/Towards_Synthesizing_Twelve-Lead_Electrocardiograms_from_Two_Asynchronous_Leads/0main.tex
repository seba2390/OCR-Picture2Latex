%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive measurement used to observe the condition of the heart and usually consists of 12 synchronous leads. Wearable devices can record ECGs, but typically provide only a single lead or a couple of asynchronous leads. Signals generated from these devices may be insufficient for accurately diagnosing more complex cardiac conditions.
To bridge this gap, we propose \textsf{ECGT2T}, a deep generative model that synthesizes ten leads from two input leads to simulate a 12-lead ECG. 
Synthesized ECGs had timing and amplitude errors under 15 milliseconds and 10\%, respectively. 
% Compared to the R-peaks of the original waveforms, synthesized ECGs had R-peaks with timing and amplitude errors under 15 milliseconds and 10\%, respectively. 
Experiments on two widely used ECG datasets show classifiers trained on simulated 12-lead ECGs generated with ECGT2T outperformed models trained on one- or two-lead ECGs in detecting myocardial infarction and arrhythmia.
