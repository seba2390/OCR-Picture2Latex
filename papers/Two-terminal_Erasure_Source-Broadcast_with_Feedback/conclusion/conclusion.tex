\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we considered the erasure source-broadcast problem in which a binary source is to be sent over an erasure broadcast channel with feedback to two receivers with erasure distortion constraints.  To the best of our knowledge, the erasure source-broadcast problem \emph{without} feedback has not been solved in the sense that to date, a set of coinciding inner and outer bounds for the latency region has not been found.  However, when studying the problem \emph{with} feedback, we have derived two conclusive results.  

Our first result was for the case in which causal feedback is universally available from both receivers.  We showed that for this problem, the Shannon source-channel separation bound can be achieved for both receivers.  That is, both receivers can achieve the same performance as if the other receiver was not present.  

We then studied a variation of the previous problem involving one-sided feedback in which causal feedback is available from only the stronger user.  We showed that the Shannon source-channel separation outer bound for the minmax latency can still be achieved despite the fact that we have feedback from only one user.
