\section{Source-broadcast with One-sided Feedback}
\label{sec:one_sided_feedback}

In this section we consider a one-sided-feedback variation of the problem in Section~\ref{sec:two_users} whereby in a broadcast network with two receivers, a feedback channel is available to only the stronger user.  In this scenario, we show that given the distortion constraints of both users, there is no overhead in the minmax latency achieved.  Specifically, for $i \in \{1, 2\}$, let $\wid$ be the point-to-point optimal latency for user~$i$ and let $\wplusd$ be the Shannon lower bound for the minmax latency where

\begin{align}
\label{eq:wid_optimal}
	\wid = \frac{1 - d_i}{1 - \epsilon_i},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\label{eq:wplusd}
	\wplusd = \max_{i \in \{1, 2\}} \frac{1 - d_i}{1 - \epsilon_i}.
\end{align}
Section~\ref{sec:two_users} showed that for $i \in \{1, 2\}$, user~$i$ can achieve distortion $d_i$ at the optimal latency $\wid$ when a feedback channel is available to \emph{both} users (c.f.\ Section~\ref{sec:individual_latencies} on individual decoding delays).  Clearly, the optimal minmax system latency $\wplusd$ is also achievable in this case.  In contrast, in this section we show that when a feedback channel is available to \emph{only the stronger user}, while the \emph{individual} optimal latencies may or may not be achievable, the overall system latency $\wplusd$ is still achievable.

% achieve point-to-point optimal performance when a feedback channel is available to \emph{both} receivers, in this section we show that point-to-point optimal performance may also be achieved if \emph{only the stronger user} has a feedback channel available.
