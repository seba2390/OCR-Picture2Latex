\subsection{Coding Scheme}

We begin by reviewing a repetition coding scheme in the next subsection, whereby we simply ignore the weaker user, and focus on using the stronger user's feedback to retransmit each of his required source symbols until it is received.  A repetition coding scheme is useful insofar as it helps avoid compelling the weaker user to decode additional source symbols that he does not require.  

As an example, consider when the stronger user requires $N$ source symbols.  We could send random linear combinations of the $N$ symbols, which he could decode after receiving $N$ equations through, say, $W$ transmissions.  By the time the stronger user has recovered the $N$ equations, the weaker user, having a weaker channel, would have received less than $N$ equations.  At this point, the weaker user could simply ignore the first $W$ transmissions, and have the transmitter encode another random linear combination of symbols for the weaker user to decode.  However, such a timesharing scheme is inefficient.

On the other hand, the weaker user could prevent the first $W$ transmissions from going to waste by continuing to receive random linear combinations of the group of $N$ source symbols originally intended for the stronger user.  However, if the weaker user requires $M < N$ symbols, he would have had to listen to many more transmissions than necessary to recover $M$ symbols thus introducing delay.

We notice the problem is in the random linear combinations used in our coding scheme.  In such a scheme, we either receive more than $N$ equations and decode the entirety of the $N$ source symbols, or we receive less than $N$ equations and decode none of the source symbols.  This ``threshold effect'' is detrimental when we have heterogeneous users in a network who require $M < N$ source symbols.  

%The weaker user would similarly need to receive $N$ equations to decode the $N$ source symbols, however, if he only requires $M < N$ symbols, he would have had to listen to many more transmissions than necessary to recover $M$ symbols.  That is, 

%Due to the threshold effect of channel coding, if we send 

The repetition coding scheme avoids this pitfall by avoiding random linear combinations altogether and instead transmitting uncoded source symbols over the channel.  While this avoids compelling the weaker user to decode unnecessary source symbols, it can also be inefficient for the weaker user.  Specifically, since the repetition scheme is based solely on the stronger user's feedback, a source symbol can be retransmitted even after it is received by the weaker user.  We show how to circumvent this problem by creating a hybrid coding scheme that consists of both repetitions, and random linear combinations.  The coding scheme is controlled by two variables, $\omegaparam$, and $\gammaparam$.  We show how to choose specific values for these parameters to achieve the optimal minmax latency in Section~\ref{sec:one_sided_optimality}.

%We then show how to incorporate random linear combinations
