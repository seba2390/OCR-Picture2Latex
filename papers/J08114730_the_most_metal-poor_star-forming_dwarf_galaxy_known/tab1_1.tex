\noindent$^\dag$Corrected for Milky Way extinction.

\noindent$^\ddag$Derived from the extinction- and aperture-corrected SDSS 
spectrum.

\noindent$^{\ddag\ddag}$Derived from the extinction- and aperture-corrected LBT 
spectrum.

\noindent$^*$Corrected for extinction and the SDSS spectroscopic aperture.

\noindent$^{\dag\dag}$Derived from the \citet{K98} relation using the extinction- 
and aperture-corrected H$\beta$ luminosity.
