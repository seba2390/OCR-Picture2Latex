``Perception is reality''. Human perception plays a vital role in forming beliefs and understanding reality. Exploring how the human brain works in the visual system facilitates bridging the gap between human visual perception and computer vision models. However, neuroscientists study the brain via Neuroimaging, i.e., Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to discover the brain's functions. These approaches face interpretation challenges where fMRI data can be complex and require expertise. Therefore, neuroscientists make inferences about cognitive processes based on patterns of brain activities, which can lead to potential misinterpretation or limited functional understanding. In this work, we first present a simple yet effective Brainformer approach, a novel Transformer-based framework, to analyze the patterns of fMRI in the human perception system from the machine learning perspective. Secondly, we introduce a novel mechanism incorporating fMRI, which represents the human brain activities, as the supervision for the machine vision model. 
This work also introduces a novel perspective on transferring knowledge from human perception to neural networks. 
Through our experiments, we demonstrated that by leveraging fMRI information, the machine vision model can achieve potential results compared to the current State-of-the-art methods in various image recognition tasks.
