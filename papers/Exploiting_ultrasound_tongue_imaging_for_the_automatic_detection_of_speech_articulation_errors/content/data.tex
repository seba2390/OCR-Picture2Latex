\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

We use data from the \textbf{Ultrasuite repository}\footnote{\label{fn:ultrasuite}\url{https://www.ultrax-speech.org/ultrasuite}} \citep{eshky2018ultrasuite}, consisting of synchronised ultrasound and audio data from child speech therapy sessions.
Ultrasuite currently contains three datasets of child speech.
Ultrax Typically Developing (UXTD) includes recordings of 58 typically developing children.
The remaining datasets include recordings from children with speech sound disorders collected over the course of assessment and therapy sessions: Ultrax Speech Sound Disorders  (UXSSD,  8  children)  and  Ultraphonix  (UPX,  20  children). 
Assessment sessions denote recordings at various stages of therapy: baseline (before therapy),  mid-therapy,  post-therapy  (immediately after therapy), and maintenance (several months after therapy).
For the child speech datasets, ultrasound was recorded with an Ultrasonix SonixRP machine using Articulate Assistant Advanced (AAA, \cite{articulate2010articulate}) software at $\sim$120fps with a 135\degree ~field of view.
A single B-Mode ultrasound frame has 412 echo returns for each of 63 scan lines, giving a $63\times412$ \enquote{raw} ultrasound frame capturing a mid-sagittal view of the tongue.
Samples from this data are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:td_samples}.

To complement the Ultrasuite repository, we use the \textbf{Tongue and Lips corpus}\footnote{Available via the Ultrasuite Repository, see footnote \ref{fn:ultrasuite}.}(TaL, \cite{ribeiro2021tal}).
TaL is a corpus of synchronised ultrasound, audio, and lip videos from 82 adult native speakers of English.
Ultrasound in the TaL corpus was recorded using Articulate Instruments' Micro system \citep{articulate2010articulate} at $\sim$80fps with a 92\degree ~field of view.
TaL used a different transducer than the one in the Ultrasuite data collection.
Because of this, an ultrasound frame of the TaL corpus contains  842  echo  returns  for  each  of  64  scan  lines ($64\times842$ \enquote{raw} ultrasound frame).
