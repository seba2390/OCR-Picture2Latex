In the present work, a complete formulation of a full-3D Dynamic ray tracing (DRT) algorithm is presented, that includes multiple reflections, edge diffraction and diffuse scattering for the general case of moving object that can translate and rotate. The approach allows to predict the multipath evolution within a given "multipath lifetime" $T_C$ on the base of a single conventional ray tracing prediction of the current multipath geometry, assuming constant speeds or accelerations for moving objects, using analytical, and therefore fast, extrapolation formulas.
The model is validated vs. traditional, multi-snapshot ray tracing prediction in an ideal, reference case, and in a real-life case presented in the literature, where it is also compared to measurements in terms of Power-Doppler Profiles. Results show a good agreement with measurements and very good agreement with traditional ray tracing prediction if the considered time-span is properly subdivided into mutiple $T_C$. The proper value of $T_C$ for vehicular applications is shown to be of the order 100 ms in the vicinity of abrupt LoS to NLoS transitions, and of the order of seconds elsewhere. The corresponding computation time speed-up with respect to ray tracing is shown to be of the order of 50x when a prediction resolution of 10 ms over a time-span of 10 s (1000 snapshots) is required.
Finally, interesting real-time applications of DRT are presented, such as ahead-of-time (or anticipative) field prediction to help Channel State Information estimation.
