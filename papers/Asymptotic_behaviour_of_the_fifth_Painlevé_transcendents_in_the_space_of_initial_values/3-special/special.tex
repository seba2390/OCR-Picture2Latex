In this section, we consider the pencil of curves corresponding to the Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:E}) of the autonomous system (\ref{eq:PVlog-system-auto}).
We show that by a birational equivalence, this pencil can be transformed to a pencil of conics.
In Section \ref{sec:conics}, we analyse the solutions of the fifth Painlev\'e equation corresponding to singular conics from the pencil.
In Section \ref{sec:other}, we give a summary of other special solutions.
