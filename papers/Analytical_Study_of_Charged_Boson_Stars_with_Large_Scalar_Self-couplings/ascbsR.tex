Pugliese {et al.}recently investigated such behavior for gravitating charged scalar theorywithout scalar self-interactions\cite{PQRR}. Both analyses relied on numerical methods. In the present paper, wewill study critical behaviors in stationary spherical charged boson starswith a large scalar self-coupling, using analytical approximations.If the charge is near critical, i.e., $e^2\approx Gm^2$, the equilibrium densitydistribution is expected to be dilute as well as large scale.The value of the central density goes to zero as the total mass becomesinfinite. Because the pressure in the center of the almost critical charged bosonstar is small compared to the energy density, the configuration approaches aNewtonian boson star in the critical limit.Therefore, we first arrive at the idea of obtaining solutions for boson stars witha small$\epsilon$, which represents the (appropriately normalized) central value of asquare of the scalar field.It should be noted that it is necessary to find solutions of the next order in$\epsilon$, because the post-Newtonian effect determines the stabilityof a definite mass and radius.The boundary between a stable and an unstable star is given by the maximum mass.It is reported \cite{Jetzer,JB} that the maximum mass increases with increasinggauge coupling constant. An important aim of the present paper is to reproduce thisbehavior semi-quantitatively in our approximation.The present paper is organized as follows.In Sec.~\ref{sec2}, we give the field equations for a boson star in generalrelativity and their large coupling limit.In Sec.~\ref{sec4}, in order to generate simple approximate solutions,we construct an approximate differential equation for the square of the scalarfield. Linearizing the equation, we obtain analytical approximate solutionsexpressed by trigonometric functions. The critical behavior in the mass of theboson star is qualitatively confirmed by using the approximate solutions.In Sec.~\ref{sec5}, we reconsider the energy density of the electric field, whichis ignored in Sec.~\ref{sec4}. After including the electromagnetic contribution tothe total mass, we again compare our approximate analysis with numerical results.Finally, we summarize and discuss our results inSec.~\ref{so}.In Appendix \ref{sec3}, a naive perturbative treatment of the equation as a powerexpansion of $\epsilon$ is given. In Appendix \ref{ApB}, we present themethod which relies on the Taylor expansion in radius coordinates and estimatesthe mass of the stable boson star in the critical limit.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Charged boson stars in large coupling limit}\label{sec2}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%We consider an Einstein--Maxwell system with a self-interacting complexscalar field$\phi$ of  mass $m$ and charge $e$,governed by the following action (where$\hbar=c=1$):\begin{eqnarray}S&=&\intd^4x\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{16\pi}\left[\frac{1}{G}R-F^2-|D_\mu\phi|^2-m^2|\phi|^2-\frac{{\lambda}}{2}|\phi|^4\right]\,,\end{eqnarray}where $d^4x=dt\,d^3\mbox{\boldmath $r$}$ , $G$ is the Newton constant,$R$ is the scalar curvature, %$g$ is the determinant of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$%$(\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3)$.and $F^2=g^{\mu\rho}g^{\nu\sigma}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}$.The field strength is defined as $F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nuA_\mu$, where $A_\mu$ is a $U(1)$ gauge field. The gauge field also appears in$|D_\mu\phi|^2\equivg^{\mu\nu}(D_\mu\phi_i)^*(D_\nu\phi_i)$, wherethe covariant derivative is $D_{\mu}=\partial_\mu+ie A_\mu$.The scalar self-coupling constant ${\lambda}$ is assumed to be positive.Varying the action with respect to the metric, we obtain the Einstein equation \begin{equation}R^\mu_\nu-\frac{1}{2}\delta^\mu_\nu R=8\pi G T^\mu_\nu\,,\label{EE}\end{equation}where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ in the system is given by\begin{eqnarray}{16\pi}T_{\mu\nu}&=&(D_\mu\phi)^*(D_\nu\phi)+(D_\nu\phi)^*(D_\mu\phi)-g_{\mu\nu}|D_\rho\phi_i|^2-g_{\mu\nu}\Big(m^2|\phi|^2+\frac{{\lambda}}{2}|\phi|^4\Big)\nonumber \\& &+4g^{\rho\sigma}F_{\rho\mu}F_{\sigma\nu}-g_{\mu\nu}F^2\,.\end{eqnarray}On the other hand, the equation of motion for the scalar field $\phi$ is givenby\begin{equation}D^\mu D_\mu \phi-m^2\phi-{\lambda}|\phi|^2\phi=0\,,\label{KE}\end{equation}and the Maxwell equation is given by\begin{equation}D_\mu F^{\mu\nu}+i\frac{e}{4}[\phi^*D^\nu\phi-\phi(D^\nu\phi)^*]=0\,.\label{ME}\end{equation}In the present paper, we consider stationary spherical boson stars. Thus, we assumethe metric with spherical symmetry\begin{equation}ds^2=-\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r}\right)e^{-2\delta(r)}dt^2+\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\varphi^2)\,.\end{equation}The ansatze for the scalar field and the gauge field are given by\begin{equation}\phi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{G}}\phi(r) e^{-i\omega t}\,,\quadeA_\mu=m(A(r)+\omega)\delta_{\mu 0}\,,\end{equation}where $\omega$ is a constant.Furthermore, we adopt the following new definitions of couplings:\begin{equation}q^2\equiv\frac{e^2}{Gm^2}\,,\quad\Lambda\equiv\frac{\lambda}{Gm^2}\,.\end{equation}Substituting the foregoing ansatze and definitions in field equations (\ref{EE}),(\ref{KE}), and (\ref{ME}) with the following replacement todimensionless variables\begin{equation}mr\rightarrow r\,,\quad GmM(r)\rightarrow M(r)\,,\end{equation}we obtain the simultaneous differential equations\begin{eqnarray}& &\phi''+\left(\frac{2}{r}-\delta'+\frac{2}{r}\frac{M-rM'}{r-2M}\right)\phi'+\left[\frac{e^{2\delta}}{1-\frac{2M}{r}}A^2-1-\Lambda\phi^2\right]\frac{1}{1-\frac{2M}{r}}\phi=0\,,\\& &A''+\left(\frac{2}{r}+\delta'\right)A'-\frac{q^2}{2}\frac{1}{1-\frac{2M}{r}}\phi^2A=0\,,\\& &\frac{2}{r^2}M'=e^{2\delta}\frac{{A'}^2}{q^2}+\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{e^{2\delta}}{1-\frac{2M}{r}}A^2\phi^2+\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right){\phi'}^2\right]+\frac{1}{2}\phi^2+\frac{\Lambda}{4}\phi^4\,,\\& &-\frac{1}{r}\delta'=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{e^{2\delta}}{\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^2}A^2\phi^2+\phi'^2\right]\,,\end{eqnarray}where the prime (${}'$) indicates the derivative with respect to $r$.To realize the configuration of a spherical boson star, we impose thefollowing boundary conditions:\begin{equation}\phi'(0)=0\,, \quad A'(0)=0\,,\quadM(0)=0\,,\quad\delta(0)=0\,,\quad \phi(\infty)=0\,,\quad A(\infty)=const.\end{equation}Note that an arbitrary value for $\delta(0)$ is allowed because it can beabsorbed by the redefinition of the time coordinate $t$.Here, we consider the large coupling limit \cite{Jetzer,colpi}.%It is incidentally known that the large coupling leads %to a large-scale boson star. To take the limit, we introduce the following quantities:\begin{equation}x\equiv\frac{g}{\sqrt{\Lambda}}r\,,\quad\Phi(x)\equiv\sqrt{\Lambda}\phi(r)\,,\quad\mu(x)\equiv\frac{gM(r)}{\sqrt{\Lambda}}\,,\label{scale}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}g=\sqrt{1-q^2}\,.\end{equation}Owing to new variables, we can take the limit of $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$;the field equations then become \cite{Jetzer}\begin{eqnarray}& &\sigma\equiv\Phi^2=\frac{e^{2\delta}}{1-\frac{2\mu}{x}}A^2-1\,,\label{eqeqs}\\& &A''+\left(\frac{2}{x}+\delta'\right)A'-\frac{q^2}{2g^2}\frac{1}{1-\frac{2\mu}{x}}\sigma A=0\,,\label{eqeqa}\\& &\frac{2}{x^2}\mu'=e^{2\delta}\frac{{A'}^2}{q^2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2\delta}}{1-\frac{2\mu}{x}}A^2\frac{\sigma}{g^2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sigma}{g^2}+\frac{1}{4}\frac{\sigma^2}{g^2}\,,\label{eqeqm}\\& &-\frac{1}{x}\delta'=\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{2\delta}}{\left(1-\frac{2\mu}{x}\right)^2}A^2\frac{\sigma}{g^2}\,,\label{eqeqd}\end{eqnarray}where, and hereafter, the prime (${}'$) stands for $\frac{d}{dx}$.Note that the first equation shows an algebraic relation valid for$\sigma=\Phi^2>0$. Therefore, the field equations are now reduced to threedifferential equations on $A(x)$, $\mu(x)$, and $\delta(x)$.The surface of the spherical boson star is defined by the radius $x=x_*$ at which$\sigma(x_*)=\Phi^2(x_*)=0$. Outside the boson star, it is thought that $\Phi(x)$vanishes for $x>x_*$.The numerical solutions for the system in the large coupling limit have beeninvestigated, for example, in Refs.~\cite{Jetzer,JB}.We will consider an approximation that leads to analytic solutions for the systemin the next section.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Approximate equation for  square of the scalar field}\label{sec4}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%When solving the field equations mathematically, we initially regard theregion of definition for $A(x)$, $\mu(x)$, and $\delta(x)$ as $[0,\infty)$,though physical meanings of the solutions hold only in the region of positive$\sigma(x)=\Phi^2(x)$; i.e., $[0, x_*]$.Here, we again give the field equations for $\alpha(x)\equivA(x)/A(0)\equiv A(x)/A_0$,$\mu(x)$, and$\delta(x)$ ((\ref{eqeqa}), (\ref{eqeqm}), and (\ref{eqeqd})):\begin{eqnarray}& &\alpha''(x)+\left(\frac{2}{x}+\delta'(x)\right)\alpha'(x)-\frac{q^2}{2g^2}\frac{1}{1-\frac{2\mu}{x}}\sigma(x)\alpha(x)=0\,,\label{ae}\\& &\frac{2}{x^2}\mu'(x)=e^{2\delta(x)}A_0^2\frac{{\alpha'(x)}^2}{q^2}+\frac{1}{g^2}\sigma(x)\left(1+\frac{3}{4}\sigma(x)\right)\,,\label{me}\\& &-\frac{1}{x}\delta'(x)=\frac{1}{2g^2}\frac{1}{1-\frac{2\mu}{x}}{\sigma(x)(1+\sigma(x))}\label{de}\,,\end{eqnarray}where\begin{equation}\sigma(x)=\frac{e^{2\delta(x)}}{1-\frac{2\mu(x)}{x}}A_0^2\alpha^2(x)-1\,.\label{ss}\end{equation}%%%If $q^2\approx 1$, an attractive force (gravity) anda repulsive force (Coulomb repulsion) almost cancel eachother out. Under the restriction that the particle number is constant, the densitybecomes low (because of the repulsive force which originates from theself-interaction of scalars\footnote{Even if the self-interaction is absent, thedensity is expected to become low due to the uncertainty principle (``quantumforce'').}) for a stable boson star.%%%Therefore, we can examine the expansion in terms of a ``small'' parameter$\epsilon$ defined by $\epsilon\equiv{A_0^2-1}=\sigma(0)$ for solving thedifferential equations. Although the equations at the lowest order of $\epsilon$become very simple, those at the next order are very complicated to analyze.This approach is described in Appendix \ref{sec3}.Thus, in the present section, we consider the other approach.Now, we investigate the relationship in terms of derivatives of $\sigma(x)$ byusing the following approximation. Because we wish to consider a stable dilute boson star, we first assume $\frac{2\mu(x)}{x}\ll 1$ and$\delta(x)\ll 1$, which are near-vacuum values ofthe variables. We will, however, take care of their derivative, which isexpressed by$\sigma(x)$ and its derivative.We next assume $(\alpha'(x))^2\ll\sigma(x)/g^2$. This assumption implies that the energy densityof the electric field is negligible compared with the energy density of the scalarfield and can therefore be omitted, because the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{me})is proportional to the total energy density. For finite values of $\sigma(x)$ andsmall $g^2$, this approximation is reasonable. Because we are now going to studythe behavior of$\sigma(x)$ in the nearly flat background, we take only the first order in theelectric field in the presentapproximation.  It is noteworthy that we do not assume $\sigma(x)\ll 1$ at thefirst time, whose value should be small for a stable dilute boson star in thecritical limit $g\approx 0$. Then, by using Eq.~(\ref{ss}), we can approximate the first derivative of$\ln(1+\sigma(x))$ as\begin{equation}\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\approx2\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}+\frac{2\mu'(x)}{x}-\frac{2\mu(x)}{x^2}+2\delta'(x)\,.\label{s1}\end{equation}Under the same assumptions, the field equations (\ref{me}) and (\ref{de})can be interpreted as\begin{eqnarray}& &\frac{2}{x}\mu'(x)\approx\frac{x}{g^2}\sigma(x)\left(1+\frac{3}{4}\sigma(x)\right)\,,\label{masseq}\\ &&2\delta'(x)\approx-\frac{x}{g^2}{\sigma(x)(1+\sigma(x))}\,,\label{deltaeq}\end{eqnarray}where we find that $\mu'(x)$ and $\delta'(x)$ are supposed to be determined by$\sigma(x)$. Eq.~(\ref{s1}) then becomes\begin{equation}\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\approx2\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}-\frac{x}{4g^2}\sigma^2(x)-\frac{2\mu(x)}{x^2}\,.\label{s11}\end{equation}One more differentiation of the above equation yields\begin{eqnarray}\frac{\sigma''(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}&\approx&2\frac{\alpha''(x)}{\alpha(x)}-2\left(\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)^2-\frac{1}{4g^2}\sigma^2(x)-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)-\frac{2\mu'(x)}{x^2}+\frac{4\mu(x)}{x^3}\nonumber \\& &+\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2\nonumber \\&\approx&2\frac{\alpha''(x)}{\alpha(x)}-\frac{1}{g^2}\sigma(x)(1+\sigma(x))-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)+\frac{4\mu(x)}{x^3}\nonumber \\& &+\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)^2\,,\label{s2}\end{eqnarray}where we used Eq.~(\ref{masseq}).Combining Eqs.~(\ref{s11}) and (\ref{s2}), we obtain \begin{eqnarray}& &\frac{1}{1+\sigma(x)}\left(\sigma''(x)+\frac{2}{x}\sigma'(x)\right)\nonumber \\& &\approx2\left(\frac{\alpha''(x)}{\alpha(x)}+\frac{2}{x}\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)-\frac{1}{g^2}\sigma(x)\left(1+\frac{3}{2}\sigma(x)\right)-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)\nonumber \\& &\quad+\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)^2\nonumber\\ & &\approx-2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}+\frac{q^2}{g^2}\sigma(x)-\frac{1}{g^2}\sigma(x)\left(1+\frac{3}{2}\sigma(x)\right)-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)\nonumber \\& &\quad+\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)^2\nonumber\\ & &\approx-\sigma(x)\left(1+\frac{3}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\right)-2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)\nonumber \\& &\quad+\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2-2\left(\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\right)^2\,,\label{eqeq}\end{eqnarray}where we used an approximate equation that comes from Eq.~(\ref{ae}),\begin{equation}\alpha''(x)+\left(\frac{2}{x}+\delta'(x)\right)\alpha'(x)-\frac{q^2}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\alpha(x)=0\,.\label{eqe}\end{equation}Note also that $\frac{q^2-1}{g^2}=-1$.The second and third terms in Eq.~(\ref{eqeq}) are reduced, if we canfurther approximate$\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}$ by $2\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}$ and useEq.~(\ref{deltaeq}), to\begin{eqnarray}& &-2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)\sigma'(x)\nonumber \\& &\approx-2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}-\frac{x}{2g^2}\sigma(x)(1+\sigma(x))\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\nonumber \\& &\approx-2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}+2\delta'(x)\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}\nonumber\\ & &\approx 0\,.\label{eqf}\end{eqnarray}Now, if we assume $(\alpha'(x))^2\ll\sigma(x)/g^2$,$\frac{2\mu(x)}{x}\ll 1$, $\delta(x)\ll 1$, and adopt theadditional assumption $|\frac{x}{4g^2}\sigma^2(x)+\frac{2\mu(x)}{x^2}|\ll2\frac{\alpha'(x)}{\alpha(x)}$, the following differential equation on$\sigma(x)$ holds:\begin{equation}\sigma''(x)+\frac{2}{x}\sigma'(x)+(1+\sigma(x))\left[\sigma(x)+\frac{3}{2g^2}\sigma^2(x)-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sigma'(x)}{1+\sigma(x)}\right)^2\right]=0\,.\end{equation}Unfortunately, exact solutions for this nonlinear equation are not known.Although it is interesting to solve this nonlinear equation, we here consider a further approximation to solve the equation analytically.%\footnote{A comment is given in Sec.~\ref{so}.}In order to solve the equation approximately, we first set$\sigma(x)\equiv\epsilon\tilde{\sigma}(0)$.

We then find the following approximate linear equation:\begin{equation}\tilde{\sigma}''(x)+\frac{2}{x}\tilde{\sigma}'(x)+(1+\epsilon)\left(1+\frac{3\epsilon}{2g^2}\right)\tilde{\sigma}(x)=0\,.\label{req2}\end{equation}%%%This approximation is considered to be good, especially for $x\approx 0$, where$\tilde{\sigma}\approx 1$ and $\tilde{\sigma}'\approx 0$. For a stable dilute boson star, it is expected that the behavior of the solutionnear the origin determines its overall shape and size.Furthermore, we have left the ``next-leading'' terms in $\epsilon$ becausethe limit of $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ in Eq.~(\ref{req1}) or Eq.~(\ref{req2})yields the result corresponding to the Newtonian limit and,as previously stated, we wish to study the relativistic mass of thecritically charged boson star. %%%The solution for the above linearized equation satisfying $\tilde{\sigma}(0)=1$ is\begin{equation}\tilde{\sigma}(x)=\frac{\sin kx}{kx}\,,\label{sinek}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}k=k(\epsilon)\equiv\sqrt{(1+\epsilon)\left(1+\frac{3\epsilon}{2g^2}\right)}\,.\end{equation}The approximate equation for $\mu(x)$ (\ref{masseq}) then yields\begin{equation}\mu(x)\approx\frac{\epsilon}{2g^2k^3}\left[\sin kx- kx\coskx+\frac{3\epsilon}{8}\left(kx-\frac{\sin 2kx}{2}\right)\right]\,.\end{equation}In Fig.~\ref{figs21} (for $g^2=0.1$ and$\epsilon=0.01$) and Fig.~\ref{figs31} (for $g^2=0.1$ and$\epsilon=0.001$), dotted lines are the numerical results in the large couplinglimit, and light solid lines are our approximations.One can see that they almost coincide.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 21%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}\begin{figure}[ht]\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figsigmas21R.eps}\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figsigmam21R.eps}\caption{Numerical solutions in the large coupling limit (dotted lines) and thepresent approximation (light solid lines) for $\sigma(x)$ and $\mu(x)$ on theinterval $[0,\pi/k]$, where$g^2=0.1$ and$\epsilon=0.01$.}\label{figs21}\end{figure}%\end{wrapfigure}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 31%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}\begin{figure}[ht]\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figsigmas31R.eps}\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figsigmam31R.eps}\caption{Numerical solutions in the large coupling limit (dotted lines) and the presentapproximation (light solid lines) for $\sigma(x)$ and $\mu(x)$ on theinterval $[0,\pi/k]$, where $g^2=0.1$and $\epsilon=0.001$.}\label{figs31}\end{figure}%\end{wrapfigure}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%The surface of the boson star is located at $x=x_*$ where$\sigma(x_*)=0$.

Thus, dropping the third-order term in the equation forsufficiently small$\epsilon$, we obtain the approximate solution\begin{equation}\epsilon=\epsilon_m\approx \frac{4}{3}g^2\frac{6}{3-g^2+\sqrt{9+168g^2-11g^4}}\,.\end{equation}Further, if we consider the limit of$g\rightarrow 0$, we find $\epsilon_m\rightarrow\frac{4}{3}g^2$,$k(\epsilon_m)\rightarrow \sqrt{3}$, and\begin{equation}\lim_{g\rightarrow 0}\mu(x_*(\epsilon_m))\approx\frac{2\sqrt{3}\pi}{27}=0.403\,.\end{equation}Thus, the mass of the stable charged boson star is found to be\begin{equation}M_{*max}\approx 0.403\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}\,,\end{equation}for a small $g=\sqrt{1-q^2}$.For a small $g$,\begin{equation}\Phi(0)_{*max}\approx\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}g=1.15{\sqrt{1-q^2}}\,,\end{equation}and\begin{equation}r_{*max}\equiv\frac{x_*(\epsilon_m)}{g}\approx\frac{\pi}{gk(\epsilon_m)}\approx\frac{\pi}{g\sqrt{3}}=1.81\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}\,.\end{equation}Jetzer and Bij \cite{Jetzer,JB} gave (in our notation) $\Phi(0)_{*max}\approx(2.43/ 2^{3/4})\sqrt{1-q^2}=1.44\sqrt{1-q^2}$,$M_{*max}\approx 0.226\times2^{3/4}\times\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}=0.537\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}$.%\footnote{The factor $2^{3/4}$ comes from the different definition of criticalcharge and its power, and the factor $\sqrt{2}$ comes from the differentdefinition of $\lambda/G$.} Therefore, the deviation from the precise value is$\sim\! 33\%$ for$M_{*max}$ and$\sim\! 20\%$ for $\Phi(0)_{*max}$.The definition of the radius of the boson star in Ref.~\cite{Jetzer} is the averageof$r_*$  over the particle density. In the present approximation, the function$\sigma(x)$ represents both the particle and the energy density. Thus, theirdefinition of the radius should be recognized as$R_*\approx 0.344~r_{*max}$, because the solution for $\sigma(x)$ is proportionalto$\sin kx/kx$, and$\{\int_0^\pi x(\sin x/x) dx\}/\{\pi\int_0^\pi (\sin x/x) dx\}\approx0.344$. Our approximate value is$R_*=0.415\times2^{3/4}\times\sqrt{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}=0.985\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}=0.344\times 2.86\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^2}}$. The deviation of $r_{*max}$ isconsidered to be $\sim\! 58\%$.Finally, in this section, we mention that it is also possible to show thequalitative$M_*$-$\sqrt{\epsilon}$ relationin the other approximation. The approximation, which utilizes the approximate functions of the order $O(x^2)$,is shown in Appendix \ref{ApB}.In the next section, we reconsider the definition of mass and inclusion of theenergy density of the electric field.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{The energy of the electric field}\label{sec5}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%In the approximation scheme in the last section,we assumed $(\alpha')^2\ll\sigma/g^2$.This corresponds to the omission of the energy density of the electric fieldas it is negligible compared with the energy density of the scalar field.In the present section, we estimate the contribution of the electric energydensity to the boson star mass.Although accounting for the electric energy in addition to the scalar energysounds inconsistent judging from the ansatz,it can be considered that the configuration is the main source field ofall the fieldsbecause the approximation for the scalar fieldconfiguration$\sigma(x)$ fits numerical computations very well.Thus, we insist that the addition of the electric energy density has a physicalmeaning.The definition of mass in Refs.~\cite{Jetzer,JB} includes the contribution ofthe electric field.It is pointed out \cite{PQRR} that $M_*$ (in our notation) differs fromthe ``actual'' mass (which is proportional to the coefficient of the inverse ofthe distance from the origin in the asymptotic region). The difference is due tothe electric contribution and has been ignored in the approximation scheme inSec.~\ref{sec4}.We adopt Eq.~(\ref{eqe}), but we omit the term $\alpha'\delta'$ in theequation, where the term is smaller than the source term $\propto \sigma$. Wethen get\begin{equation}\alpha(x)\approx 1+\frac{q^2\epsilon}{2g^2k^2}\left(1-\frac{\sin kx}{kx}\right)\qquad\mbox{for } x<x_*=\pi/k\,.\label{51}\end{equation}Note that in this section we consider the solutions for $\alpha(x)$ inside theboson star $(x<x_*)$ and outside the boson star $(x>x_*)$ separately. Therefore,the electric contribution to the mass inside the boson star can be estimated as\begin{equation}\DeltaM_*(\epsilon)=\frac{1+\epsilon}{2g}\int_0^{x_*}\frac{(\alpha'(x))^2}{q^2}dx=\frac{\piq^2\epsilon^2(1+\epsilon)}{16g^5k^5}\,,\end{equation}where we approximated $\delta\sim 0$.The ratio of the correction\begin{equation}\frac{\DeltaM_*(\epsilon)}{M_*(\epsilon)}=\frac{q^2\epsilon(1+\epsilon)}{8g^2k^2\left(1+\frac{3\epsilon}{8}\right)}\end{equation}is at most $8\%$ in the parameter region of Fig.~\ref{figms}, and theapproximate value of $M_*+\Delta M_*$ cannot be larger than that of the numericalresult.Next, we consider the contribution of the electric field outside the boson star.At the surface of the boson star, $x=x_*=\pi/k$, and from Eq.~(\ref{51}), we have\begin{equation}\alpha(x_*)\approx\frac{q^2\epsilon}{2g^2k^2}\,,\quad\alpha'(x_*)\approx\frac{q^2\epsilon}{2g^2k\pi}\,.\end{equation}Outside the boson star, $\alpha$ behaves inaccordance with $\alpha(x)=C_0+\frac{C_1}{x}$, which is the solution of the fieldequation $\alpha''(x)+\frac{2}{x}\alpha'(x)=0$. Thus, we find the followingsolution for $\alpha(x)$ outside the boson star, which is smoothly connected tothe solution for $\alpha$ inside the boson star:\begin{equation}\alpha(x)\approx\frac{q^2\epsilon}{2g^2k^2}-\frac{\piq^2\epsilon}{2g^2k^3x}\qquad\mbox{for }x>x_*\,.\end{equation}Using this solution, we find the electric energy outside the charged boson staras\begin{equation}\Delta M_{outside}=\frac{1+\epsilon}{2g}\int_{x_*}^\inftye^{2\delta(x_*)}\frac{(\alpha'(x))^2}{q^2}\,.\end{equation}In the present approximation scheme,$\delta(x_*)=-\frac{\epsilon}{g^2k^2}+O(\epsilon^2)$. Therefore, we again ignore$\delta(x_m)$ and obtain\begin{equation}\Delta M_{outside}(\epsilon)=\frac{\pi q^2\epsilon^2(1+\epsilon)}{8g^5k^5}\,,\end{equation}which is the same order as $\Delta M_*$.We then estimate the total mass as\begin{equation}M(\epsilon)\equiv M_*(\epsilon)+\Delta M_*(\epsilon)+\DeltaM_{outside}(\epsilon)=\frac{\epsilon\pi}{2g^3k^3}\left(1+\frac{3\epsilon}{8}\right)+\frac{3\pi q^2\epsilon^2 (1+\epsilon)}{16g^5k^5}\,,\end{equation}which is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{figmall} for $g=0.1,0.2,\mbox{~and~} 0.3$.For small values of $\Phi(0)=\sqrt{\epsilon}$, approximate values fitthe numerical results  better than the previous approximation. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% mall%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}\begin{figure}[ht]\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figmall.eps}\caption{Approximate charged boson star mass $M$ (including the electric energy) inunits of$\sqrt{\Lambda}/(Gm)$ as a function of$\Phi(0)=\sqrt{\Lambda}\phi(0)$ for $g=0.1, 0.2,\mbox{~and~} 0.3$ (from the upperline to the lower line) for the case $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$.

We have now obtained good approximate values by including the electricenergy contribution.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Summary and discussion}\label{so}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%In this paper, we presented  approximate solutions fordilute charged boson stars with spherical symmetry in the large scalarself-coupling limit. An approximation scheme is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec4}, wherewe first consider the approximate differential equation for the square of thescalar field $\sigma(x)$. In this approximation, we assumed that the contributionof the energy density of the electric field is relatively small. A furtherlinearized approximation yields a fully analytic approximation for a chargedboson star. In Sec.~\ref{sec5}, we improved the approximation by reconsidering theelectric energy.Because it has been recognized that solutions with an $\epsilon$ value thatis smaller than the maximum$\epsilon_m$ value are stable and the others are unstable,our approximation has a certain physical meaning for stable configurations ofcharged boson stars.We confirmed that the maximum mass of the boson star increases with the gaugecoupling constant as$(\sqrt{1-q^2})^{-1}$ for a charge close to the critical charge $e^2\approxGm^2$ in our approximation, whose deviation from the numerical result is onthe order of a few ten percent.It was pointed out that there is a localized configuration even if thecharge of the scalar field is larger than the critical coupling forscalar theory without self-coupling \cite{PQRR}.The analysis of the critical behavior of the maximum mass in the largeself-coupling limit under consideration is nevertheless valid, because the largecoupling limit does not yield higher node solutions \cite{Jetzer}, whereas onlysolutions with nodes exist for over-critical cases as reported in Ref.~\cite{PQRR}for scalar theory with no self-interaction.Our analytically approximate solutions can be used to check the validity ofnumerical solutions generally. Analytic solutions can also be used as a backgroundconfiguration in an investigation of the quantum vacuum around charged boson stars\cite{JLS}, as well as the seeds of an exact solution (for instance, nonspherical)in numerical computations.We would like to improve the approximation for not so small $\epsilon$.To this end, we have to try a basic approach such as the Pad\'e approximation.In Sec.~\ref{sec4}, a nonlinear equation for $\sigma(x)$ has been derived.We wish to use some type of renormalization group methods\cite{CGO1,CGO2,BB1,BB2} to evaluate the solution, though it is difficult todirectly apply the known methods to the present form of the equation.Finally, we should consider the analysis of charged boson stars in scalar theorywith an arbitrary self-coupling. We hope to return to these and other subjects infuture work.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\appendix%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Perturbative expansion in terms of $\epsilon$}\label{sec3}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Here, we solve the field equations obtained inSec.~\ref{sec2} as a perturbative expansion in $\epsilon$.First, we define \begin{eqnarray}A(x)&=&A_0\alpha(x)=A_0(1+\epsilon \alpha_1(x)+\epsilon^2\alpha_2(x)+\cdots)\,,\label{exp1}\\\mu(x)&=&\epsilon \mu_1(x)+\epsilon^2 \mu_{2}(x)+\cdots\,,\label{exp2}\\\delta(x)&=&\epsilon \delta_{1}(x)+\epsilon^2 \delta_{2}(x)+\cdots\,,\label{exp3}\end{eqnarray}where $\epsilon$ is a parameter defined as\begin{equation}\epsilon\equiv A_0^2-1\quad\mbox{or}\quad A_0\equiv\sqrt{1+\epsilon}\,,\end{equation}which means\begin{equation}\sigma(0)=\Phi^2(0)=\epsilon\,,\end{equation}if we identify boundary conditions $\alpha_i(0)=\mu_i(0)=\delta_i(0)=0$$(i=1, 2, \dots)$.The value of $\epsilon$ is expected to be small in the critical limit$q^2\approx 1$ or equivalent to $g^2\approx 0$.Substituting the above series expansions (\ref{exp1}), (\ref{exp2}), and(\ref{exp3}) into the field equations (\ref{eqeqs}), (\ref{eqeqa}), (\ref{eqeqm}),and (\ref{eqeqd}), we find the equations in the first order in powers of$\epsilon$, \begin{eqnarray}\alpha_1''+\frac{2}{x}\alpha_1'&=&\frac{q^2}{g^2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)\,,\\\frac{1}{x^2}\mu_{1}'&=&\frac{1}{g^2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)\,,\\\frac{1}{x}\delta_1'&=&-\frac{1}{g^2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)\,,\end{eqnarray}which are just the linearized field equations.In this order, using $\alpha_1''+\frac{2}{x}\alpha_1'=\frac{1}{x^2}(x^2\alpha_1')'=\frac{1}{x}(x\alpha_1)''$ and paying attention to the similarity of theright-hand sides of the equations,we can easily obtain analyticsolutions under the boundary conditions at $x=0$ as\begin{eqnarray}\alpha_1(x)&=&\frac{q^2}{2g^2}\left(1-\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)\,,\\\mu_{1}(x)&=&\frac{1}{2g^2}\left(\sin x-x\cos x\right)\,,\\\delta_1(x)&=&-\frac{1}{2g^2}\left(1-\cos x\right)\,.\end{eqnarray}Up to this order, the profile of the scalar field is found to be\begin{eqnarray}\Phi^2(x)&\approx& (1+\epsilon)(1+2\epsilon\delta_1(x))\left(1+\epsilon\frac{2\mu_{1}(x)}{x}\right)(1+\epsilon\alpha_1(x))^2-1\nonumber \\&=&\epsilon\left(1+2\alpha_1(x)+\frac{2\mu_{1}(x)}{x}+2\delta_1(x)\right)+O(\epsilon^2)\nonumber \\&=&\epsilon\frac{\sin x}{x}+O(\epsilon^2)\,.\end{eqnarray}This profile has been obtained in the same system by the Newtonian approximation.Because we now treat dilute boson stars, the result is just a verification of thepresent lowest-order analysis.The field equations in the second order of $\epsilon$ can be read as\begin{eqnarray}\alpha_2''+\frac{2}{x}\alpha_2'&=&\frac{q^2}{g^2}\left(%\frac{\rho}{2}+\alpha_2+\frac{\mu_{2}}{x}+\delta_2\right)+f_\alpha\,,\\\frac{1}{x^2}\mu_{2}'&=&\frac{1}{g^2}\left(%\frac{\rho}{2}+\alpha_2+\frac{\mu_{2}}{x}+\delta_2\right)+f_\mu\,,\\\frac{1}{x}\delta_2'&=&-\frac{1}{g^2}\left(%\frac{\rho}{2}+\alpha_2+\frac{\mu_{2}}{x}+\delta_2\right)+f_\delta\,,\end{eqnarray}where\begin{eqnarray}f_\alpha&=&-\alpha_1'\delta_1'+\frac{q^2}{g^2}\left[\left(\alpha_1+\frac{2\mu_{1}}{x}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)+X\right]\,,\\f_\mu&=&\frac{1}{2q^2}\alpha_1'^2+\frac{1}{g^2}\left[\frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)^2+X\right]\,,\\f_\delta&=&-\frac{1}{g^2}\left[\left(1+2\alpha_1+\frac{4\mu_{1}}{x}+2\delta_1\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}+\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1\right)+X\right]\,,\\X&=&\alpha_1+\frac{\mu_{1}}{x}+\delta_1+\frac{\alpha_1^2}{2}+2\frac{\mu_{1}^2}{x^2}+\delta_1^2+\frac{2\mu_{1}}{x}\alpha_1+\frac{2\mu_{1}}{x}\delta_1+2\alpha_1\delta_1\,.\end{eqnarray}These inhomogeneous differential equations can be solved easily.For this purpose, we have only to know that the inhomogeneous equation\begin{equation}u''(x)+u(x)=f(x)\end{equation}has a general solution (where $A$ and $B$ are integration constants)\begin{equation}u(x)=A\sin x+B\cos x+\sin x\int_0^xf(t)\cos t\, dt-\cos x\int_0^xf(t)\sin t\, dt\,.\end{equation}The solutions are given by\begin{eqnarray}\alpha_2&=&\frac{q^2}{8g^4}\Big\{-[\gamma_E+\ln 2x-\mbox{Ci}(2x)]-(1-\cos x)\frac{\sin x}{x}%+(4\rho-3%)g^2\left(1-\frac{\sin x}{x}\right)\nonumber \\&

x+(3\mbox{Si}(x)-\mbox{Si}(3x))\sinx\right]\Big\}\,,\end{eqnarray}where $\gamma_E$ is the Euler--Mascheroni constant,the sine integral is defined as $\mbox{Si}(z)\equiv\int_0^z\frac{\sin t}{t}dt$,and the cosine integral is defined as $\mbox{Ci}(z)\equiv-\int_z^\infty\frac{\cost}{t}dt$.Note that the mathematical relations$\gamma_E+\ln 2x-\mbox{Ci}(2x)=\int_0^{2x}\frac{1-\cos t}{t}dt$and$\ln 3+\mbox{Ci}(x)-\mbox{Ci}(3x)=\int_0^{3x}\frac{1-\cos t}{t}dt-\int_0^{x}\frac{1-\cos t}{t}dt$ have been used.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

O((\epsilon/g^2)^i)$.Thus, if $\epsilon/g^2\ll1$, the perturbative approximation works welland the solutions up to the second order agree with the numerical results. The solutions are parameterized by $\epsilon=\sigma(0)$.The stability of the objects described by the solutions is discussedby variations of this parameter.%\footnote{In some cases, however, quasi-stable configurations with a very longlifetime may be admitted as astrophysical objects.} It isdemonstrated that the configuration is stable if the boson star mass takesthe maximum value with respect to variations of this parameters.To obtain the maximum mass of boson stars, we first evaluate the value of$\mu(x)/g$ at the surface of the boson star $x=x_*$ and next consider thevariation with respect to the parameter $\epsilon$.The perturbed solution we obtained is not suitable for such calculations inthe analytic method, because of the complexity seen in the second-order solutions.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{Approximation by the Taylor expansion in $x$}\label{ApB}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%We consider the solution  for the fieldequations  (\ref{ae})--(\ref{de}) at the lowest order in the Taylor expansion in$x$ around $x=0$ with the boundary condition $\sigma(0)=\epsilon$.We then find\begin{eqnarray}\alpha(x)&\approx&1+\frac{q^2\epsilon}{12 g^2}x^2\,,\\\frac{\mu(x)}{x}&\approx&\frac{\epsilon(3\epsilon+4)}{24 g^2}x^2\,,\\\delta(x)&\approx&-\frac{\epsilon(1+\epsilon)}{4 g^2}x^2\,.\end{eqnarray}Accordingly, using Eq.~(\ref{ss}), we find $\sigma(x)$ at the lowest order as\begin{eqnarray}\sigma(x)&\approx& (1+\epsilon)(1+2\delta(x))\left(1+\frac{2\mu(x)}{x}\right)(\alpha(x))^2-1\nonumber \\&\approx&\epsilon\left(1-\frac{3\epsilon+2g^2}{12g^2}x^2\right)\,,\end{eqnarray}where we assume that $\epsilon$ is small, which is expected for a stable diluteboson star. We obtain the radius of the boson starfrom the present approximation as\begin{equation}x_*(\epsilon)\approx\sqrt{\frac{12g^2}{3\epsilon+2g^2}}\,,\end{equation}and\begin{equation}\mu(x_*(\epsilon))\approx\frac{g\epsilon(3\epsilon+4)}{24}\left(\frac{12}{3\epsilon+2g^2}\right)^{3/2}\,.\end{equation}We show $M_*=\mu(x_*(\epsilon))/g$ as a function of $\sqrt{\epsilon}=\Phi(0)$in Fig.~\ref{figmt}. The qualitative behavior of the graph is similar to that inRefs.~\cite{Jetzer,JB} (see also the discussion in Sec.~\ref{sec4}).%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% mt%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{5cm}\begin{figure}[ht]\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figmtR.eps}\caption{Charged boson star mass (approximated using the second-order functions) in units of$\sqrt{\Lambda}/(Gm)$ as a function of$\Phi(0)=\sqrt{\Lambda}\phi(0)$ for $g=0.1, 0.2,\mbox{~and~} 0.3$ (from the upperline to the lower line) for the case $\Lambda\rightarrow\infty$.

Therefore, no purpose is served by making a furthercorrection due to the electric field.} than those in the previous approximation discussed inSec.~\ref{sec4}.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\acknowledgments%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Acknowledgements%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\begin{acknowledgments}%We thank%the organizers of JGRG21, where our%partial result %({\tt [arXiv:10mm.xxxx]}) %was presented. %for elucidating comments.%This study is supported in part by the Grant-in-Aid of Nikaido Research %Fund.%\end{acknowledgments}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%We thank Prof.~Kenji Sakamoto for much inspiration from his master's thesissubmitted about two decades ago.%We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.jp) for English language editing.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   References%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%thebibliography%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\bibliographystyle{apsrev}\bibliographystyle{apsrev4-1}%\bibliography{}\begin{thebibliography}{99}\bibitem{BHS}G.~Bertone, D.~Hooper and J.~Silk,%Particle Dark Matter: Evidences, Candidates and ConstraintsPhys.
