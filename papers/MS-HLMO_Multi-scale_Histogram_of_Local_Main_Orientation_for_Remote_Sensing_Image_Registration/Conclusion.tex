In this paper, an image registration algorithm has been proposed for multi-source remote sensing image registration. The proposed MS-HLMO utilizes Partial Main Orientation Map (PMOM) based on Average Squared Gradient (ASG) as the basic feature map, a generalized GLOH-like (GGLOH) descriptor structure, and multi-scale feature extraction and matching strategy, which has the benefit of high robustness to multimodal properties and effectively deals with the key problems of intensity distortion, rotation, and scale differences in registration of multi-source images. Comprehensive experiments on 17 datasets of multi-source remote sensing scenes reveal the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed MS-HLMO and its simplified version MS-HLMO$^+$ compared with other state-of-the-art registration methods.
