\begin{abstract}
We present here the result of continuation work, performed to further
fulfill the vision we outlined in~\cite{harel:17} for the
visualization and analysis of tree-based adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) simulations, using the \emph{hypertree grid} paradigm which
we proposed.

The first filter presented hereafter implements an adaptive approach in
order to accelerate the rendering of $2$-dimensional AMR grids,
hereby solving the problem posed by the loss of interactivity
that occurs when dealing with large and/or deeply refined meshes.
Specifically, view parameters are taken into account, in
order to: on one hand, avoid creating surface elements that are
outside of  the view area; on the other hand, utilize level-of-detail
properties to cull those cells that are deemed too small to be visible
with respect to the given view parameters.
This adaptive approach often results in a massive increase in
rendering performance.

In addition, two new selection filters provide data analysis
capabilities, by means of allowing for the extraction of those cells
within a hypertree grid that are deemed relevant in some sense, either
geometrically or topologically.
After a description of these new algorithms, we illustrate their use
within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) in which we implemented them.
This note ends with some suggestions for subsequent work.
