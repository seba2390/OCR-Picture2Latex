\begin{abstract}
The $E_1$-term of the ($2$-local) $\bo$-based Adams spectral sequence for the sphere spectrum decomposes into a direct sum of a $v_1$-periodic part, and a $v_1$-torsion part.
Lellmann and Mahowald completely computed the $d_1$-differential on the $v_1$-periodic part, and  the corresponding contribution to the $E_2$-term.  The $v_1$-torsion part is harder to handle, but with the aid of a computer it was computed through the $20$-stem by Davis.  Such computer computations are limited by the exponential growth of $v_1$-torsion in the $E_1$-term.  In this paper, we introduce a new method for computing the contribution of the $v_1$-torsion part to the $E_2$-term, whose input is the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra.  We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique by computing the $\bo$-Adams spectral sequence beyond the $40$-stem.
