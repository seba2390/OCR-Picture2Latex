\section{Conclusions}
\begin{spacing}{0.9}
%The emerging NVM provides a solution to address the problem
%of memory scalability and power efficiency for future HPC. However, 
The limitation of NVM imposes a question on 
whether NVM is a feasible solution for HPC workloads. 
In this paper, we quantify the performance gap 
between NVM-based and DRAM-based systems, and demonstrate that
using a carefully designed runtime, it is possible
to significantly reduce the performance gap. 
%We introduce a series of techniques to achieve our design goals, including transparency, lightweight, and non-disruptiveness to hardware and application. 
We hope that our work can lay foundation to embrace NVM for future HPC.
