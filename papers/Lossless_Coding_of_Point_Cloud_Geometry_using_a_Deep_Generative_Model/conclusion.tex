\par This paper presents a lossless compression method for point cloud geometry. We extend a well-known auto-regressive generative model initially proposed for 2D images to the 3D voxel space, and we incorporate  3D data augmentation to efficiently exploit the redundancies between points. This approach enables to build accurate probability models for the arithmetic coder. As a result, when using an adaptive partitioning scheme and context extension, our solution outperforms MPEG G-PCC over a diverse set of point clouds. 

Our analyses on the performance of the proposed method indicate at least two major avenues for improvement. On one hand, handling low-density point clouds would require to rethink the network architecture to handle sparse input data. On the other hand, a major drawback of VoxelDNN is the high computational cost of sequential probability generation, which we plan to replace in the future by a more efficient generative model.
