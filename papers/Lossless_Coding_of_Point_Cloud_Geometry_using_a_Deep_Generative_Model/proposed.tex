\subsection{System overview}
\label{problem fomulation}
In this work, we propose a learning-based method for lossless compression of point cloud geometry. We aim at minimizing the encoded rate measured by the number of bits per occupied voxel (bpov) by exploiting the spatial redundancies within point cloud. The general scheme of our method is shown in Figure \ref{fig:system overview}. A point cloud voxelized over a $2^n \times 2^n \times 2^n$ grid is known as an $n$-bit depth PC, which can be represented by an $n$ level octree. In this work, we represent point cloud geometry in a hybrid manner, by combining  the octree and voxel domains. We coarsely partition an $n$-depth point cloud up to  level $n-6$. This allows to coarsely remove most of the empty space in the point cloud. As a result, we obtain a $n-6$ level octree and a number of non-empty binary blocks $v$ of size $2^6 \times 2^6 \times 2^6$ voxels, which we refer to as resolution $d=64$ or simply block 64 (Figure \ref{fig:system overview}(a)). Blocks 64 can be further partitioned at resolution $d=\{64,32, 16, 8, 4\}$ corresponding to maximum partitioning level $maxLv=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ as detailed in Section~\ref{ssec:multires}. Figure \ref{fig:system overview}(b) shows the multi-resolution encoder with $maxLv=2$.  A block of size $d$ can be encoded as a single block (b2) or partitioned into 8 sub-cubes (b1). We then encode each non-empty block (blocks in blue in the figure) using the proposed method in the voxel domain (Section~\ref{ssec:voxelDNN}) and select the  partitioning mode resulting in the smallest bpov. The overview of a single block encoder is shown in Figure \ref{fig:system overview}(c). Our context model predicts the distribution of each voxel given all encoded voxels and pass it to an arithmetic coder to generate the final bitstream. The context is chosen adaptively following a rate optimization algorithm (Section~\ref{ssec:multires}). The high-level octree, partitioning signal, selected context as well as the depth of each block are converted to bytes and signaled to the decoder as side information. For ease of notation, we index all voxels in block $v$ at resolution $d$ from $1$ to ${d^3}$ in raster scan order with:
 \begin{equation}
    v_i= 
    \begin{cases} 
    1, \quad \text{if $i^{th}$ voxel is occupied}\\
    0, \quad \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
