We have studied a novel generalization of CMDP that we have called SICMDP. In particular, we have considered a continuum of constraints rather than a finite number of constraints.
We have devised two reinforcement learning algorithms SI-CRL and SI-CPO to solve SICMDP problems.
Furthermore, we have presented theoretical analysis for our proposed algorithms, establishing the iteration complexity bounds as well as the sample complexity bounds.
We have also performed the extensive numerical experiments to show the efficacy of our proposed methods and its advantage over traditional CMDPs.
%The limitation of our work is that 
% However,
% the SI-CRL algorithm can only handle the tabular case, with a nice offline dataset avaliable.
% We would study the SICMDP beyond the tabular case and develop efficient algorithms in future works.
