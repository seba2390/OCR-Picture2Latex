%Here we show that many cases require a fast method with direct evaluations (and geometry-free sampling) rather than a pure hierarchical semi-separability (hss) approach. 
There exist a few software packages on hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank
matrices. HODLR \cite{ambikasaran2013mathcal} \& STRUMPACK
\cite{rouet-li-e16} 
can be applied black-box on stored matrices and in the explicit matrix version assume that given ordering allows hierarchical semi-separability (hss). Here, we are only interested in the compression and evaluation methods (but both codes also offer factorization). We compared it to our method that only requires access to entries $K_{ij}$.

For compression, HODLR uses a partial pivoted LU decomposition for off-diagonal blocks; STRUMPACK uses a randomized interpolative decomposition according to \cite{liberty2007randomized}. The user may specify random vectors for sampling, but in many cases this is unknown; we used a black-box compression routine using a uniform random distribution and a householder rank-revealing QR. Results for a few interesting cases are listed in table \ref{tab:existingSoftware}; in some of them notable differences occur. K04 is a Gaussian kernel and K07 a Laplace kernel for Gaussian random points; the applied ordering is random and STRUMPACK can lead to very inaccurate results.

\caption{ Matrix sizes $N\times N$: For K02-12 $N=36K$, K17 $N=32K$, G03 $N=65K$; leaf node size $m=512$, for evaluation nRhs=$1024$. Internal parameters reasonably adapted such that target error accuracy of around $1E-4$ is reached. 
Results in single precision computed on a Intel Haswell node with 24 cores, 2.6 GHz, 64 GB DDR4-2133.\\
NOTE TO US: \\
STRUMPACK needs some adaption: K04 \& K07 are kernels for gaussian random points, so ordering very random. Larger sampling sizes up to 8192 don't resolve. For K17 and G03 bigger sampling sizes are less accurate }
