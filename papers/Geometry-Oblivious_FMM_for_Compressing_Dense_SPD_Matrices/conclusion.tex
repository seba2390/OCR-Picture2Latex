By using the Gramian vector space for SPD matrices, we defined distances between rows of $K$ using only  matrix
values. Using the distances, we introduced \gofmm{} and \hmatrix{} scheme that
can be used to compress arbitrary  SPD matrices (but without accuracy
    guarantees).  In \gofmm{} we use a shared-memory runtime system that
performs \emph{out-of-order} scheduling in parallel to resolve the dynamic
workload due to  
adaptive ranks and the parallelism-diminishing issue during tree traversals.
Our future work will focus on the distributed algorithms and the hierarchical matrix factorization based on our method. 
We also plan to improve the sampling and pruning quality and to reduce the
number of parameters that users need to provide.
