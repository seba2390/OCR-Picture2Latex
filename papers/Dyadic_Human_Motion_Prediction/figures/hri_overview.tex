	\caption[Single person motion forecasting baseline]{\textbf{Single person motion forecasting baseline~\cite{Mao20}.} The baseline model aggregates information from the history of poses (keys) by comparing them to the last observed sequence of poses (query) through an attention mechanism. $f_k$ and $f_q$ are modeled with convolutional layers. The weighted sum of the values are concatenated with the DCT coefficients of the last observed poses and fed into the GCN that outputs the future pose predictions.}
