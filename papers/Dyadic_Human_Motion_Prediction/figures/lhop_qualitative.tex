	\caption[Qualitative 3D motion prediction results on the \lindyhop{} test subjects]{\textbf{Qualitative evaluation of our results on the LindyHop600K test subjects compared to the state-of-the-art methods.} Black: Ground truth, green: TIM~\cite{Lebailly20}, blue: MSR-GCN~\cite{Lingwei21}, violet: HRI~\cite{Mao20}, red: Ours-Dyadic. Top two portions show the predictions for dancer with the follower role. Bottom two portions show the predictions for the dancer with the leader role. The left side of the vertical bar in the black row depicts the sampled input to our model and the right side shows the ground truth future poses. The colored rows correspond to the predictions of the state-of-the-art single person approaches. The red row depicts the output of our model shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview_3dmotion_forecasting}. The numbers at the top indicate the timestamp in milliseconds and the green region highlights the long-term predictions.}
