\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec.conclusion}

We presented an approach for employing content-based sources of pseudo relevance for training neural IR models. We demonstrated that our approach can match (and even outperform) neural ranking models trained on manual relevance judgments and existing ranking-based weak supervision approaches using two different sources of data. We also showed that performance can be boosted using two filtering techniques: one heuristic-based and one that re-purposes a neural ranker. By using our approach, one can effectively train neural ranking models on new domains without behavioral data and with only limited in-domain data.
