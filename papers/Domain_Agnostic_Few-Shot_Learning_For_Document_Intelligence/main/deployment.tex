\section{Applications and Deployment}
Document image classification can find many enterprise level applications in insurance companies to reduce manual review and stream line claims processes. For example, casualty injuries claims usually have multiple correspondences with hospitals and clinics, each involving documents to be processed by the insurance company. Personal automobile claims processing can use automatic document classification of letters of guarantee, purchase receipts, and others in order to auto-approve a certain percentage of auto claim reimbursements. Each year, millions of claim related document images sent to insurance companies belonging to hundreds of categorizes related to financial institutions, medical providers, or legal organizations. A scalable document classifier can assign the correct categories as meta data to a document, which can be used to route to appropriate downstream tasks. Given the scale document image classification can be deployed in an enterprise, 
% an effective machine learning approach, 
an efficient framework for model training and iterations, together with an economical model hosting solutions has clear cost advantages.  
To support all those applications and achieve potential scalability , we are in the progress of deploying this trained model as an API under Container as a Service (CaaS) on AWS using Fargate managed Elastic Container Service (ECS). The efficient model size facilitates faster deployment and ease of maintenance. A standard ECS task with v4CPUs and 30G RAM can be used and the weights of the trained model can be conveniently packaged in a dockerized image and deployed at scale.
