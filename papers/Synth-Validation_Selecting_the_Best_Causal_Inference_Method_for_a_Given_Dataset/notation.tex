\section{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}

Let bold functions $\mathbf{f}$ represent the row-wise vectorized versions of their scalar counterparts $f$: $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) = [f(x_1), f(x_2) \dots f(x_n)]^T$. 

Let $I_a(z)$ be the indicator function for $z=a$.

Let $P(Z^*)$ be a distribution that places probability $\frac{1}{n}$ on each element of  a set of samples $\{z_1, z_2 \dots z_n\}$. Let $z^*$ denote a sample from $Z^*$ and $\bm{z}^*$ denote a set of $n$ such samples (a bootstrap sample).

\subsection{Notation for Observational data}

Observational datasets are represented by a set of $n$ tuples of observations $(x_i,w_i,y_i)$. For each subject $i$, $x_i \in \mathcal{R}^{p}$ is a vector of observed pre-treatment covariates, $w_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ is a binary indicator of treatment status, and $y_i \in \mathcal{R}^n$ is a real-valued outcome. Let capital letters $X$, $W$, and $Y$ represent the corresponding random variables. Let $\mathcal{S}_0$ be the set of indices of untreated subjects, and $\mathcal{S}_1$ the set of indices of treated subjects: $\mathcal{S}_w = \{i | w_i = w\}$.  Denote a series of I.I.D. realizations of a random variable $z \sim P(Z)$ as $\bm{z}$ so that the full observational dataset can be written as $d = (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{y})$ where $(x_i,w_i,y_i) \overset{\text{I.I.D.}}{\sim} P(X,W,Y)$. 

The average treatment effect is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\tau = E_{X,Y}[Y|X,W=1] - E_{X,Y}[Y|X,W=0]
\label{eq:effect}
\end{equation}

which is the expected difference between what the outcome would have been had a subject received the treatment and what the outcome would have been had a subject not received the treatment, averaged over all subjects in the population. %The outcomes under each of these conditions are referred to as potential outcomes. Let those be denoted as $f_w(x,u) = f(x,u,w) = E[Y_w | X, U]$. %Note that $f_w(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}) + \bm{\eta} \in \mathcal{R}^n$, but $\mathbf{y}_w \in \mathcal{R}^{n_w}$. The latter does not include potential outcomes under treatment $w$ that were not observed.
