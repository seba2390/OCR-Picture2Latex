\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-5pt}
We have introduced object-aware cropping, a simple, fast and highly effective data augmentation alternative to random scene cropping. We conducted numerous experiments to show that object cropping significantly improves performance over scene cropping for self-supervised pre-training for classification, object detection and semantic segmentation on a number of datasets. The approach can be incorporated into most self-supervised learning pipelines in a seamless manner. 
% Our approach is broadly applicable to self-supervised learning and representation learning. 
% Since our work is a technical contribution, it's societal impact is dependent on the underlying models, which we hope are used in a positive manner for the good of society.

% Since our work is a technical contribution, it's ethical concerns will be dependent on the underlying models, which we hope are used in a positive manner for the good of society.
