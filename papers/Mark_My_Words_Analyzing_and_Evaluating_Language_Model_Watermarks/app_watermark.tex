\subsection{Techniques to Allow Diverse Generation}\label{app:ssec:diverse}

In order to add some diversity to the generations, there are different strategies.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=\itemlm,itemsep=2pt]
    \item For a fixed randomness source, \citet{kuditipudi_robust_2023} proposes to randomly shift the sequence of random values $\{r^k_i\}$ by an offset $s$, such that $r_n = r^k_{(s+n) \text{ (mod L)}}$. This means there are a total of $L$ possible unique values for $r_n$ depending on $s$. For a text-dependent randomness source, this trick does not work. 
    \item Instead, one natural strategy is to randomly skip the watermarking selection procedure for some tokens, and instead sample the next token from the original multinomial distribution. We denote \textbf{S} this skip probability. 
    \item Another strategy, discussed by \citet{christ_undetectable_2023}, is to only start watermarking text after enough empirical entropy has been generated: the first tokens are selected without a watermark. This accomplishes the same effect, and guarantees undetectability. However, as discussed in the paper's appendix, a user not wanting to generate watermarked text can simply run the model, keep the first few tokens, add them to the prompt, and start again: After repeating this step enough time, they can generate arbitrarily long text without a watermark. This seems like a larger practical drawback than loosing the guarantee of undetectability, thus we use the skip probability instead for promoting diversity. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exact Distribution of the Score Function}\label{app:ssec:exact_dist}

The null hypothesis distribution for the exponential scheme with the regular test variable is an Irwin-Hall distribution centered with parameter $N$ (whose average quickly converges to a normal distribution centered in 0.5 with variance $\frac{1}{12N}$).
%
When using the log test variable, the null distribution is the Erlang distribution with parameter $N$. The binary scheme also follows an Erlang distribution, but with many more tokens since each token is broken down into a binary vector. The distribution-shift scheme has a null distribution a binomial with parameters $\gamma, N$. We derive these distributions in the appendix.

However, for both other scores, and for the inverse transform, the null hypothesis distribution is too complex to compute. In these cases, verification uses a permutation test, as described in Kuditipudi et al.. Instead of comparing the score to a known distribution, we sample independent random sequences $\tilde{r}_i$ and compute the score of the text for that randomness: these trials are distributed like non watermarked text, so we can use them to compute an empirical p-value.
