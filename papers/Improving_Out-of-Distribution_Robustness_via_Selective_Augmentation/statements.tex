% \section*{Ethics Statement}
% We have proposed Learning Invariant Representations with Selective Augmentation(LISA), which only focuses on the domain shifts problem, one general and critical problem in machine learning. We claim that our work does no include any of the following: human subjects, practices to data set releases, potential harmful insights, methodologies and applications, potential conficts of interest and sponsorship, discrimination/bias/fairness concerns, and security issues, legal compliance, and research integrity issues. 






\section*{Reproducibility Statement}
We conduct experiments under the setting of domain shifts and subpopulation shifts problems. In terms of the domain shifts, the results are reported in in Table~\ref{tab:res_domain}. The dataset details are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_domain_data}, and the training details along with the hyperparameter settings are in appendix~\ref{sec:app_domain_training}. Then, for the subpopulation shifts, we have included the full results including the error bounds in Table~\ref{tab:subpopulation_main_full}. The dataset details are discussed in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_sub_data}, while the training details and the hyperparameter settings are in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_sub_training}. We will release the code upon publication.
Besides, The detailed proof of Theorem \ref{thm1} and Theorem \ref{thm3} are provided in Appendix \ref{sec:app_proof}.
