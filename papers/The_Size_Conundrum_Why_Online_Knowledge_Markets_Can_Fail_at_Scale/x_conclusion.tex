\section{Conclusion}

% Final version
In this paper, we examined the CQA websites on \CQA{StackExchange} platform through an economic lens by modeling them as knowledge markets. In particular, we designed a set of production models to capture the content generation dynamics in these markets. The resulting best-fit model, Cobb-Douglas, predicts the production of content in StackExchange markets with high accuracy. We showed that the model provides intuitive explanations for content generation. Specifically, it reveals that factors of content generation such as user participation and content dependency have \emph{constant elasticity}; in many markets, factors exhibit \emph{diminishing returns}; markets vary according to their \emph{returns to scale}; and finally many markets exhibit \emph{diseconomies of scale}. We further investigated these prognoses by showing the presence of diseconomies of scale in terms of content production, and several measures of market health. The implications of our work are two-fold: site operators need to design incentives as a function of number of participants; there is a need to develop Economic lenses that can shed insights into the complex dependencies amongst different content types and participant actions in general social networks.
