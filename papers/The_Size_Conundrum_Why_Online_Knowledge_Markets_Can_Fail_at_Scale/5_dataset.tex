\section{Dataset} 
We collected the latest release (September, 2017) of the \CQA{StackExchange} dataset. This snapshot is a complete archive of all activities in \CQA{StackExchange} sites. There are 169 sites in our collected dataset. For the purpose of empirical analysis, we only consider the sites that have been active for at least 12 months beyond the \emph{ramp up} period (site created, but few or no activity). There are 156 such sites. The age of these sites vary from 14 months to 111 months, number of users from 1,072 to 547,175, and the number of posts (questions and answers) from 1,600 to 1,985,869. Further, the sites have small overlaps in user base; therefore, we can reasonably argue that the underlying markets are independent.

In Figure~\ref{fig:dataset} we present letter value plots (in log-scale) to show the distribution of number of months (age), number of users, and number of posts for 156 \CQA{StackExchange} sites.
