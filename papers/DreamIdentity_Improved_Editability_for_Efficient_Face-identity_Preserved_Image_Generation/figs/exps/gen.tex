  \caption{Qualitative comparisons on the self-augmented dataset for \editb \  learning. The editing prompt is "S* as a police, looking at the camera". "w/o edit" and "w/o recon" denote for the encoder is trained without \editb \ learning objective and without reconstruction learning, respectively. We show that the generated images can not follow the prompt properly without the \editb \ learning. Meanwhile, the face similarity will be lower without the reconstruction learning on FFHQ.}
