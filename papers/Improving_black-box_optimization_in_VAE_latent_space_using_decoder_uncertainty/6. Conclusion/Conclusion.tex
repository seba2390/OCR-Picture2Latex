\section{Conclusion}

Black-box optimization in the latent space of VAEs can be substantially enhanced by leveraging the uncertainty of the decoder to avoid regions that will eventually lead to an invalid or low-quality decodings. This is even more critical when one has to explore regions that are far away from the VAE prior to uncover optimal objects. 
As a future research direction, leveraging the uncertainty of the property network jointly with constraints on the decoder uncertainty may make the search in latent even more robust to invalid decodings. 
Lastly, the importance sampling-based estimator introduced in this work is general-purpose and may be relevant to other applications that would benefit from reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates for complex high-dimensional data (e.g., active learning or anomaly detection).
