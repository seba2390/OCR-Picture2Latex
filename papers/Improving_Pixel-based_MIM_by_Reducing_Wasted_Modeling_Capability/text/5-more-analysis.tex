\section{Analysis}
In order to uncover the dark secret behind multi-level feature fusion, we first conduct a frequency analysis on the model (with and without MMF) in \autoref{sec:freq_ana}. In \autoref{sec:optim_ana}, we find multi-level feature fusion can be helpful to the optimization of the model, by flattening the loss landscape. Finally, in \autoref{sec:proprietary}, we apply the first pilot experiment introduced in \autoref{sec:intro} to EVA \cite{EVA} and supervised ViT \cite{MAE}, to investigate whether they too require low-level features and to confirm that the bias towards low-level details is the unique and inherent drawback of pixel-based MIM.
