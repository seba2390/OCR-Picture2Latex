\subsection{Frequency Analysis}
\label{sec:freq_ana}
We employ multi-level feature fusion to enhance MAE \cite{MAE}, resulting in MFF$_\text{MAE}$. The aim of this fusion is to prevent the model from excessively focusing on low-level details. To investigate the change in frequency response before and after the fusion, we transform the feature from the last encoder layer into the frequency domain and calculate the amplitude of various frequency bands. As depicted in \autoref{fig:last_layer_freq}, multi-level feature fusion diminishes high-frequency responses and amplifies those that belong to the low-frequency range, which supports the efficacy of the fusion technique.
