Following \cite{howdo}, we analyze the Hessian max eigenvalue spectrum. Multi-level feature fusion has the additional benefit of reducing the magnitude of Hessian max eigenvalues. As shown in \autoref{fig:optim_eigen}, the expected hessian max eigenvalue of MFF$_\text{MAE}$ is smaller than that of MAE\cite{MAE}. Hessian max eigenvalues represent the local curvature of the reconstruction loss function, and this result suggests that multi-level feature fusion flattens the loss landscape. Large eigenvalues can impede neural network training~\cite{ghorbani2019investigation}. Therefore, \textit{multi-level feature fusion can help the model learn better representations by suppressing large Hessian eigenvalues.}
