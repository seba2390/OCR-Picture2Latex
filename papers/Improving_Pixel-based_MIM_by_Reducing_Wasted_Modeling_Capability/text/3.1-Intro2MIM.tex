We now introduce the unified formulation of recent pixel-based Masked Image Modeling(MIM) methods. This kind of MIM, using raw images as target, is a denoising autoencoder \cite{denoising}, and it follows a simple pipeline. Its primary objective is to predict raw pixel values of the original or post-processed images, such as the high-frequency filtered image in PixMIM \cite{pixmim}. When dealing with masked images, we can feed only visible tokens into the encoder or both visible and mask tokens. If only visible tokens are used for the encoder, both the mask token and the latent feature output by the encoder must be fed into the decoder. 
\comment{The \textbf{black} code shown in \autoref{alg: rgb-mim} represents the general framework for this approach.}
