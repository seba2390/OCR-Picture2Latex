% Multi-level feature fusion can be incorporated into most of existing pixel-based MIM approaches without any efforts. 
We now introduce the proposed multi-level feature strategy for pixel-based MIM methods. In \autoref{method:intro2mim}, we first give a short revisit to the universal framework of pixel-based MIM approaches. Then \autoref{method:insert} describes how to insert multi-level feature fusion into pixel-based MIM approaches. Finally, two key components, the projection layer and fusion strategy, will be discussed in \autoref{method:proj_and_fusion}.

Our method is intuitive and simple, and can be inserted into most of pixel-based MIM approaches without introducing non-negligible computational overhead. We evaluate it on MAE\cite{MAE} and PixMIM\cite{pixmim}, and more detailed results are shown in \autoref{sec:main_results}.
