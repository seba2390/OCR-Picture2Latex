\subsection{Robustness Evaluation}
\label{sec:robust_eval}
Robustness evaluation is a common practice in many previous works \cite{zhou2021ibot,MILAN,MAE} to assess a model's ability to handle different types of noise. In this study, we compare our pre-trained models with their corresponding baselines on four out-of-distribution (OOD) ImageNet variants: ImageNet-Corruption \cite{ImageNetC}, ImageNet-Adversarial \cite{ImageNetA}, ImageNet-Rendition \cite{ImageNetR}, and ImageNet-Sketch \cite{ImageNetS}. These datasets introduce various domain shifts to the original ImageNet-1K and are widely used to evaluate a model's robustness and generalization ability. As illustrated in \autoref{tab:ood}, \ourmethod significantly improves the robustness of MAE and PixMIM on all datasets by a clear margin. The enhanced robustness against domain shifts strengthens the value of our simple yet effective method.
