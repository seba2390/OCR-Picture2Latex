\caption{\textbf{MAE~\cite{MAE} attempts to extract low-level features from shallow layers, whereas EVA~\cite{EVA} and DEiT~\cite{DeiT} do not.} MAE refers to MIM approaches that use the raw pixel as the target, while EVA refers to MIM approaches that use additional tokenizers like CLIP\cite{CLIP}. Supervised ViT denotes supervised learning approaches. Compared to EVA and supervised ViT, MAE exhibits a greater affinity for low-level features and displays a more aggressive appetite for them.}
