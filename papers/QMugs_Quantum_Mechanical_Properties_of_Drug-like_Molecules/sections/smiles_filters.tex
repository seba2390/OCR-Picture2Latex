\section{SMILES filtering}
The molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database were filtered to exclude the following SMARTS patterns using RDKit~\cite{rdkit} (version 2020.03.3.0): \\

\texttt{B}, \texttt{[*]$\sim$P($\sim$[*])($\sim$[*])($\sim$[*])$\sim$[*]}, \texttt{[*]$\sim$S($\sim$[*])($\sim$[*])($\sim$[*])$\sim$[*]}, \texttt{[S+$^\wedge$3]}, \texttt{[P+$^\wedge$3]}, \newline 
\texttt{[*]$\sim$[F,Cl,Br,I]$\sim$[*]}, \texttt{[Be]}, \texttt{[Na]}, \texttt{[Al]}, \texttt{[Si]}, \texttt{[Sc]}, \texttt{[Ti]}, \texttt{[V]}, \texttt{[Cr]}, \texttt{[Mn]}, \texttt{[Fe]}, \texttt{[Co]}, \texttt{[Ni]}, \texttt{[Cu]}, \texttt{[Zn]}, \texttt{[Ga]}, \texttt{[Ge]}, \texttt{[As]}, \texttt{[Se]}, \texttt{[Rb]}, \texttt{[Sr]}, \texttt{[Y]}, \texttt{[Zr]}, \texttt{[Nb]}, \texttt{[Mo]}, \texttt{[Tc]}, \texttt{[Ru]}, \texttt{[Rh]}, \texttt{[Pd]}, \texttt{[Ag]}, \texttt{[Cd]}, \texttt{[In]}, \texttt{[Sn]}, \texttt{[Sb]}, \texttt{[Te]}, \texttt{[Cs]}, \texttt{[Ba]}, \texttt{[La]}, \texttt{[Ce]}, \texttt{[Pr]}, \texttt{[Nd]}, \texttt{[Pm]}, \texttt{[Sm]}, \texttt{[Eu]}, \texttt{[Gd]}, \texttt{[Tb]}, \texttt{[Dy]}, \texttt{[Ho]}, \texttt{[Er]}, \texttt{[Tm]}, \texttt{[Yb]}, \texttt{[Lu]}, \texttt{[Hf]}, \texttt{[Ta]}, \texttt{[W]}, \texttt{[Re]}, \texttt{[Os]}, \texttt{[Ir]}, \texttt{[Pt]}, \texttt{[Au]}, \texttt{[Hg]}, \texttt{[Pb]}, \texttt{[Bi]}, \texttt{[Fr]}
\\

Compounds containing these substructures were excluded as they were either incompatible with the used MMFF94s force field\cite{tosco2014bringing} (\textit{e.g.,} \texttt{B}), contained halogens bound to two neighbors (\textit{e.g.,} \texttt{[*]$\sim$[F,Cl,Br,I]$\sim$[*]}), or elements with reduced relevance for drug-like molecules.
