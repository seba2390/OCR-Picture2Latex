\section{Overlap with other datasets}
The overlap between the compounds included in the QMugs dataset with those included in other datasets featuring DFT-properties, namely QM9~\cite{ramakrishnan2014quantum}, PubchemQC~\cite{nakata2017pubchemqc} and ANI-1~\cite{smith2017anid}, was investigated. Overlap was computed based on the respective compounds' InChI~\cite{heller2015inchi} strings. For each dataset, the molecules were converted from their original formats (QMugs: \texttt{.sdf}, QM9: \texttt{.xyz}, PubChemQC: \texttt{.mol}, ANI-1: SMILES~\cite{weininger1988smiles}, as obtained with the \texttt{pyanitools} module included in the ANI-1 repository) to InChIs using Openbabel~\cite{o2011open, openbabel} (version 3.1.1). Molecules that could not be successfully converted were skipped. The Venn diagram (Fig. 4, main article) was constructed using the \texttt{pyvenn}~\cite{pyvenn} package. Note that due to different washing procedures, the same compound identifier may refer to different InChI strings in different datasets (\textit{e.g.}, protonated and unprotonated).
