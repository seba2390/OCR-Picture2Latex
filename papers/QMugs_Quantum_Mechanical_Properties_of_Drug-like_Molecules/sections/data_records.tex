\section*{Data Records}

All computed molecular structures, as well as their corresponding properties and wave functions are accessible through the ETH Library Collection service (\href{https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000482129}{Data Citation 1})~\cite{qmugs_repository}.

\subsection*{Format specification}
A \texttt{summary.csv} comma-separated file contains computed molecular-level properties and additional annotations. A compressed tarball file (\texttt{structures.tar.gz}) of $\sim7$~gigabytes (GB) contains plain MDL structure-data files~\cite{dalby1992description} (SDFs) with embedded atomic and molecular properties, grouped in sub-directories according to their respective ChEMBL identifiers. These SDFs include single-point electronic properties calculated on the GFN2-xTB and $\omega$B97X-D/def-SVP levels of theory, as described in Table~\ref{tbl:properties}. A second compressed tarball file (\texttt{vibspectra.tar.gz}, $\sim3$~GB) contains vibrational spectra.

Wave function files, including additional properties such as DFT-density and orbital matrices, as described in Table~\ref{tbl:wfn}, are split into $100$ compressed tarballs (\texttt{wfns\_xx.tar.gz}) of $\sim50$~GB each for easier management and downloading. These are supplied as NumPy~\cite{harris2020array} (\texttt{.npy}) binary files, which can be read using the Psi4 software package. Molecules (with all conformers grouped together) were assigned at random to the tarballs to enable easy use of subsets of the QMugs dataset without having to download all the files. The assignment of ChEMBL identifiers to tarballs is described in a \texttt{tarball\_assignment.csv} file.
