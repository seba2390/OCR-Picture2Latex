\section*{Code availability}

All analyses were supported by the Python programming language (version 3.7.7) and its scientific software stack~\cite{harris2020array}. Molecular conformations were generated using RDKit~\cite{rdkit} (version 2020.03.3) and GFN2-xTB~\cite{grimme2017robust, bannwarth2019gfn2, pracht2019robust, grimme2019exploration, bannwarth2020extended} (version 6.3.1). All quantum mechanical calculations were carried out with Psi4~\cite{smith2020psi4} (version 1.3.2). Molecular structure visualizations were created using PyMol~\cite{PyMOL} (version 2.3.5) and ChemDraw (version 19.1.1.32). The rclone (\url{https://rclone.org}) WebDAV client was used for all data uploading purposes.
