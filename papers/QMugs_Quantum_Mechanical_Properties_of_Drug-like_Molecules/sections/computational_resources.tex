\section{Computational resources}
For practical reasons, molecules whose DFT-calculations demanded computational resources that exceeded empirically determined limits, were discarded. These limits include a maximum processing power of $4$ CPU cores for $24$ h wall-time, up to $40$ GB of system memory, and $100$ GB of scratch space. For the single-point property calculations, this was the case for $9$ structures. Additionally, $19$ structures (GFN2-xTB) and $24$ structures (DFT) were discarded as the respective calculations could not be completed successfully.
