In this work, we propose an effective prompting technique, Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting, to unlock compositional generalization abilities in LLMs. Specifically, SKiC prompts consist of two major building blocks: the basic skills that are needed for solving the problems, and the examplars of how to compose these skills into solutions for complex problems. Significant improvements on symbolic manipulation, arithmetic operation, question answering, dynamic programming, and math reasoning tasks demonstrate that our SKiC prompting technique is highly effective in unleashing the compisitionality in LLMs. Notably, with SKiC prompting, the LLMs could generalize beyond the skills provided in the prompting context and learns to activate the skills and knowledge that are acquired through earlier pretraining stages for solving unseen complex problems.
