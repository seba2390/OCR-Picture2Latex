}
\newcommand{\FIGNOTESMAINFIGTWO}{\small\EMPHNOTES The left panel contains observed data, while the right panel depicts the conditional distribution of daily mean ambient \PARPMTEN exposure after controlling for conception year and month interaction fixed effects.}
\newcommand{\FIGNOTESMAINFIGTHREE}{\small\EMPHNOTES The x-axis of the sub-plots corresponds to results from different conditional quantile estimations. 
We interpret lower conditional quantiles as corresponding to higher levels of unobserved innate vulnerabilities for babies. 
The two subfigures in the top panel are based on estimates from Tables \ref{tab:mainthree} and \ref{tab:mainfive}.
The two subfigures in the bottom panel are based on estimates from Appendix Tables \ref{tab:appone} and \ref{tab:appthree}. 
The y-axis reports regression coefficients. The left and right panels depict the same information in two ways.
The solid line in the right panel shows the gap between the HS and college quantile coefficient lines in the corresponding left panel. The gaps depicted on the right provide a visualization of the maternal college education and pollution interaction coefficients, from Table \ref{tab:mainfive} in the top panel for \PARPMTEN or from Table \ref{tab:appthree} for the composite index.
In the top panel, coefficients indicate grams of birth weight change for each additional $\mu g/m^3$ of average daily mean ambient \PARPMTEN exposures. In the bottom panel, coefficients indicate grams of birth weight change for each additional index unit of the composite index.}
\newcommand{\FIGNOTESMAINFIGFOUR}{\small\EMPHNOTES The x-axis of the figure represents different ambient \PARPMTEN exposure levels during the course of pregnancy, which correspond to the range of ambient \PARPMTEN exposure levels reported in Table \ref{tab:maintwo}. The y-axis reports predicted college premium in birth weight--the predicted gap in birth weight between college-educated and non-college-educated mothers. Given estimates from Tables \ref{tab:mainthree} and \ref{tab:mainfive}, each line corresponds to predictions for children at differing conditional quantiles. The premium is greater at higher ambient exposure levels and for children with higher levels of unobserved innate vulnerabilities--those at lower conditional quantiles.}
