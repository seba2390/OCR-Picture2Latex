This paper presents the first implementation of a generic tiered vector
supporting any constant number of tiers.
We have shown a number of modified versions of the tiered vector, and employed several optimizations to the implementation. These implementations have been compared
to vector and multiset from the C++ standard library.
The benchmarks show that our implementation
stays on par with vector for access and on update operations
while providing a considerable speedup of more than $40\times$ compared to multiset. 
At the same time the asymptotic difference between the logarithmic complexity
of multiset and the polynomial complexity of tiered vector
for insertion and deletion operations only has little effect in practice.
For these operations, our fastest version of the tiered vector suffers less than 10\% slowdown.
Arguably, our tiered array provides a better trade-off
than the balanced binary tree data structures used in the standard library for most applications
that involves big instances of the dynamic array problem.
