The first and $i^{th}$ element of a sequence $A$ are denoted 
$A[0]$ and $A[i-1]$ respectively
and the $i^{th}$ through $j^{th}$
elements are denoted $A[i-1,j-1]$. Let $A_1 \cdot A_2$ denote the concatenation
of the sequences $A_1$ and $A_2$. $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in the
sequence $A$. A circular shift of a sequence $A$ by $x$ is the sequence
 $A[|A| - x, |A| - 1] \cdot A[0, |A| - x - 1]$. Define the remainder of division of $a$
by $b$ as $a \mod b = a - qb$ where $q$ is the largest integer such that $q \cdot b \leq a$.
Define $A[i,j] \mod w$ to be the elements $A[i \mod w], A[(i+1) \mod w], \ldots , A[j\mod w]$,
i.e. $A[4,7] \mod 5$ = $A[4],A[0],A[1],A[2]$. Let $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denote the largest integer smaller than $x$.
