\section{Opinion Analysis}\label{sec:appendix}

\subsection{Complete Opinion List}
We provide a complete list of opinions obtained from the labeling \revK{iterations} in \Cref{tab:opinion_list} along with the frequencies of individual opinions in $L_0$ and $L_7$.

\subsection{Top Opinion Daily Relative Frequency}
\revK{We further show the daily relative frequencies of top $10$ opinions of \textit{2019-20 Australian bushfire season}, \textit{climate change} in \Cref{fig:opinion_relative_frequency_1} and \textit{Covid-19}, \textit{vaccination} in \Cref{fig:opinion_relative_frequency_2}.
For both groups of plots, notably, general upward trends over times are observed for conspiracy opinions indicating an increase of attention from users, while more downward trends are prevalent for other opinions.}
