We consider the CPS security problem when both the system and attacker have limited knowledge about the opponent. The system is equipped with multiple controllers/estimators/detectors, such that each combination of these components constitute a subsystem. A subsystem has a probability to detect specific types of attacks with different control and detection costs. To balance the security overhead and the control cost under various attacks, we consider switching among subsystems (choose a model for every component) according to the system dynamics and detector information. A switched system model is shown in Figure~\ref{system}, and the model of each component is described with a concrete example in the rest of this section. It is worth noting that the set of subsystems is not restricted and can be further generalized. %We assume that the controller/estimator/detector are not compromised, and attackers can not hack code implemented in these components in this work.

\textbf{LTI plant and sensor attack model}: Consider a class of LTI plants described by: % standard state-space form:
%
%\vspace{-3pt}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{x}_{k+1}= \mathbf{Ax}_{k}+\mathbf{Bu}_{k}+\mathbf{w}_{k},\quad
\mathbf{y}_{k}= \mathbf{Cx}_{k}+\mathbf{v}_{k},
\end{split}
\label{system}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{x}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \mathbf{u}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$ and $\mathbf{y}_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ denote the discrete time state, input and output vectors respectively, and $\mathbf{w}_{k}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{Q})$, $\mathbf{v}_{k}\sim  \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{R})$ are independent and identically distributed (IID) Gaussian random noise. The initial state is $\mathbf{x}_{0}\sim  \mathcal{N}(\bar{\mathbf{x}}_{0}, \Sigma)$. Sensors or the communication between sensors and estimators are vulnerable, and attacker can change values $\mathbf{y}_k$ that sent from sensors of system~\eqref{system}, and the compromised sensor measurements are defined as $\mathbf{y}'_k$ according to the types of attacks we consider. For instance, if the attacker can inject arbitrary data $\mathbf{y}^a_k$ to sensors, $\mathbf{y}'_k=\mathbf{y}_k+\mathbf{y}^a_k$; for replay attacks, the attacker can choose the replay window size $T_2$, let $\mathbf{y}'_{k} =\mathbf{y}_{k-T_2}$ and decide whether to send the delayed plant outputs at $k$. 

\textbf{Estimators}: % Kalman filter is widely applied for noisy systems. 
The physical dynamical state of the system is provided by an estimator, for instance, attack resilient estimator~(\cite{res_estimator}), $l_1$ norm state estimator~(\cite{resest_cdc15}), fault detection filter~\cite{fd_filter}, or the widely applied Kalman filter.
When $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$ is stabilizable, $(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{C})$ is detectable, a steady state Kalman filter exists. 



\textbf{Controllers}: A state feedback control law is described as $\mathbf{u}_k=L(\hat{x}_{k|k})$, where $L(\cdot)$ is a linear function, $\hat{x}_{k|k}$ is the estimated state. \cite{replay} increase the detection rate by adding an IID Gaussian signal $\Delta \mathbf{u}_{k} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{L})$ to $\mathbf{u}_k^*$ to an optimal LQG controller as $\mathbf{u}_{k} = \mathbf{u}^{*}_{k} + \Delta \mathbf{u}_{k} \label{nlqg}$, and increase the control cost. Then always applying the non-optimal controller for detecting a replay attack is not cost optimal, especially when there is no replay at all during a long time.

\textbf{Detectors}: We assume that every detector of the subsystem provides a detection rate for a specific type of attack, and a system is equipped with several detectors in order to deal with multiple types of attacks. Researchers have designed probabilistic detectors with respect to different attacks. For instance, \cite{fd_filter} design a fault detection filter, including a residual estimator and a threshold and a decision logic unit. Hypothesis testing strategies such as maximum likelihood (MLE), maximum a posteriori (MAP), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) account for GPS spoofing attack is presented by~\cite{GPS_spoof}. %By testing the statistical profile of a spoofing attack with methods  the probability and cost of detecting one spoofing attack are evaluated. 

%However, each method of hypothesis testing has the largest detection rate with respect to a different type of spoofing attack with some cost. We need to decide which detection strategy to use in order to secure the system with some probability and not cost too much. 

\textbf{Cyber state -- discrete modes of the system}:
We denote the modes of a vulnerable system as three constants $S=\{\delta_1,\delta_2, \delta_3\}$. State $\delta_{1}=safe$ describes that the system has already successfully detected an attack; $\delta_{2}= no~detection$ specifies that the alarm is not triggered; finally, the system enters state $\delta_{3}= false~alarm~trigger$ when the alarm is triggered while no attack has yet occurred. The mode depends on the probability detection rate. We assume that once the alarm is triggered, the system will stop the execution and decide whether to react to occurred attacks or it is a false alarm. %When the system is hijacked, the estimator, detector and controller are fed with false data, until an alarm is triggered and the system reacts to the attack.

%With different types of controllers or probabilistic detectors, it is necessary to introduce a new framework to balance the security overhead and system's performance. With system dynamics model, the cost of compromised by one type of attack and the payoff of detecting it or keeping resilient are also changing under different system states. A switching policy is then promising as a solution under this scenario. 

\iffalse
For the steady state Kalman filter, a $\chi^2$ detector triggers the alarm when the estimation residual is greater than the threshold with a specific false detection rate.
It is worth noting that even without the knowledge of system dynamics, a replay attacker can compromise values from all sensors.

For example, with Kalman Filter $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k|k}$ as a state estimator, an optimal LQG controller is described as $\mathbf{u}_k=\mathbf{ L \hat{x}}_{k|k}$. Here $L$ is a time invariant matrix satisfying $L\triangleq -(\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{SB}+\mathbf{U})^{-1}\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{SA}$, and $\mathbf{S}$ is the solution of the Riccati equation 
%\begin{equation*}
$\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{SA}+\mathbf{W}-\mathbf{A}^{T}\mathbf{SB}(\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{SB}+\mathbf{U})^{-1}\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{SA},$
%\end{equation*}
for some $\mathbf{W,U} \succ 0$ of corresponding dimensions.

%. Replay attack is undetectable for a subsystem with optimal LQG control, Kalman filter and $\chi^2$ detector. The expectation of residual signal will increase under replay attack, the quadratic cost also increase to $J'= J+trace{[(\mathbf{U}+\mathbf{B}^{T}\mathbf{SB})\mathcal{L}]}$,where $J$ denotes the cost for optimal LQG control input $\mathbf{u}^{*}_{k}$~(\cite{replay}). The probability of having a residual that greater than the alarm threshold value for a normal $\chi^2$ detector is also increased under replay attacks.
