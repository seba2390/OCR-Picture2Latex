\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}
In this work, we have proposed a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model to capture the interactions between a cyber-physical system and an attacker --- switching policy for the system under different types of sensor attacks. This framework allows us to find a control policy by calculating stationary strategy of the game with information of the system's physical dynamics and cyber modes. We design a suboptimal value iteration algorithm for a finite horizon game, which considers a saddle-point equilibrium of a robust stochastic game at each iteration. To reduce the computational complexity, a real-time moving-horizon algorithm is then developed. Based on the concept of saddle-point equilibrium for the hybrid stochastic game, at each stage, we look one stage ahead to calculate anticipated future value. The stability conditions of the system under multiple types of attacks based on the stochastic game framework, and an alternative algorithm with unknown transition matrix or payoffs will be our future work.
