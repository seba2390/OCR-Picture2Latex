\section{Conclusions}
\begin{spacing}{0.9}
With the emergence of NVM, how to leverage performance and non-volatility characteristics of NVM for future HPC is largely unknown.
In this paper, we study how to use NVM to build data persistence for critical data objects of applications to replace traditional checkpoint.
Our study enables the frequent establishment of data persistence on NVM
with small overhead, which enable high resilient HPC and minimized recomputation.
%Our work lays foundation for using NVM for future resilient HPC.
