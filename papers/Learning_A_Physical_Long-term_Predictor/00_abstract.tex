Evolution has resulted in highly developed abilities in many natural intelligences to quickly and accurately predict  mechanical phenomena. 
%
Humans have  successfully developed laws of physics to abstract and model such mechanical phenomena. 
%
In the context of artificial intelligence, a recent line of work has focused on estimating physical parameters based on sensory data and use them in physical simulators to make long-term predictions. 
%
In contrast, we investigate the effectiveness of a single neural network for  end-to-end long-term prediction of mechanical phenomena. 
%
Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that such networks can outperform alternate approaches having even access to ground-truth physical simulators, especially when some physical parameters are unobserved or not known {\em a-priori}. 
%
Further, our network outputs a distribution of outcomes to capture the inherent uncertainty in the data. 
%
Our approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of making actionable long-term predictions from sensor data {\em without} requiring to explicitly model the underlying physical laws.
