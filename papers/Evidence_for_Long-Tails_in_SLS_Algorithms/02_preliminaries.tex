We assume familiarity with terminologies such as Boolean variable, literal, clause, CNF formula, the SAT problem, and assignment flips in SLS solvers and refer the reader to \egcite~\cite{ST13SATProblem}.
We furthermore trust that the reader has basic knowledge of the proof system Resolution \cite{Blake37Canoncial,Robinson65Machine-oriented}.
\introduceterm{Stochastic local search} (SLS) solvers operate on complete assignments for a formula~$F$.
These solvers are started with a randomly generated complete initial assignment~$\alpha_0$.
If~$\alpha_0$ satisfies~$F$, a solution is found.
Otherwise, the SLS solver tries to find a solution by performing a random walk over the set of complete assignments for the underlying formula.
A formula~$F$ \introduceterm{logically implies} a clause~$C$ if every complete truth assignment which satisfies~$F$ also satisfies~$C$, for which we write $F \vDash C$. If $L$ is a set of clauses we write $F \vDash L$ if $F \vDash C$ for all $C \in L$.







\begin{definition}
	\label{def:RestartsUseful}
	Let $X$ be a random variable 
	for
	the runtime of an 
	SLS 
	algorithm~$\mathcal{A}$ on some input.
	For $t > 0$, the algorithm~$\mathcal{A}_t$
	is obtained by restarting~$\mathcal{A}$ after time~$t$ if no solution was found. %
	Restarts are \introduceterm{useful} if there is a $t > 0$ %
	such that
	\begin{align*}
		\expectation{X_t} < \expectation{X},
	\end{align*}
	where $X_t$ models the runtime of~$\mathcal{A}_t$. 
\end{definition}




\begin{definition}[\cite{norman1994continuous}]
	\label{def:cdf_quantile}
	Let $X$ be a real-valued random variable.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Its \introduceterm{cumulative distribution function}
		(cdf) %
		is the function $F \colon \R \to [0,1]$ with 
			\[
			F(t) := \prob{X \leq t}. %
			\]
	\item
		Its \introduceterm{quantile function} $Q \colon (0,1) \to \R$ is given by $Q(p) := \inf \setdescr{t \in \R}{F(t) \geq p}$.
	\item
		A non-negative, integrable function~$f$ such that 
		$F(t) = \integralLow[u]{-\infty}{t}{f(u)}$
		is 
		called 
		\introduceterm{probability density function} (pdf) of~$X$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}







\begin{definition}[\cite{Wicksell17OnLogarithmicCorrelation}]
	An absolutely continuous, positive random variable~$X$ is \introduceterm{(three-parameter) lognormally distributed} with parameters 
	$\sigma^2 > 0$, $\gamma > 0$, and $\mu \in \R$, 
	if $\log(X - \gamma)$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. In the following, we refer to $\sigma$ as the \introduceterm{shape}, $\mu$ as the \introduceterm{scale}, and $\gamma$ as the \introduceterm{location parameter}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
	Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be independent, identically distributed real-valued random variables
	with realizations $x_i$ of $X_i$.
	Then the \introduceterm{empirical cumulative distribution function} (\introduceterm{ecdf}) of the sample $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is defined as
		\[
		\hat{F}_n(t) := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Indikator{\set{x_i \leq t}}, \quad t \in \R,
		\]	
	where $\Indikator{A}$ is the indicator of event $A$.
