\subsection{Results and Discussion: Allende meteorite}
Figure~\ref{fig:Allende_Carbon} shows the spectrum of muonic X-rays obtained using BE2820 for the Allende meteorite in the energy regions of the muonic $K_\alpha$ ray of carbon (a) and muonic $L_\beta$ rays of iron (b). %sodium (b). 
The blue and red lines indicate the spectrum without and with Compton suppressors, respectively. The peaks in Fig.~\ref{fig:Allende_Carbon}(a) in the 75-78 keV region are the $K_\alpha$ rays (75.265 keV) from carbon, $L_\beta$ rays (75.7 keV) from magnesium, and $L_\alpha$ rays (76.6 keV) from silicon. 
%The peaks in Fig.~\ref{fig:Allende_Carbon}(b) in the 248-250 keV region represent the $L_\alpha$ rays (248.8 keV) from manganese, and $K_\alpha$ rays (249.9 keV) from sodium. 
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Allende_Carbon}, the Compton component was reduced by maintaining the peak component at more than 95\%.
The energy peaks of electric X-rays from bismuth contained in the BGO crystals were eliminated through subtraction using their signals, as shown in the peak in the 87.4-keV region in Fig~\ref{fig:Allende_Carbon}(a). 
%74.8, 77.1, 86.8 keV
The S/N ratio of the $K_\alpha$ rays originating from carbon was improved from 0.532(34) to 0.995(54) using the BGO Compton suppressor. 
Similarly, the S/N ratios of the $L_\beta$ rays from iron were improved from 0.75(7) and 0.34(6) to 2.8(4) and 1.4(2), respectively, which are approximately 3.9 times the original values. 
%0.21(3) to 0.53(6), 2.5 times : sodium

Based on these results, we showed that the photon detection system using the thin planer Ge detector with a Compton suppressor can detect at least 0.3~wt\% carbon %and 0.34~wt\% sodium
mixed with 15~wt\% magnesium, 16~wt\% silicon, and 24~wt\% iron, which could not be detected in previous study~\cite{Terada2014-cw}.

The blue (above) line represents the original spectrum of the Ge detector, and the red (below) line represents the subtracted spectrum with BGO Compton suppression. In addition to the muonic L$_\beta$ rays from iron (358.2 and 362.0 keV), a part of the muonic K series from magnesium (352.6, 372.3, 381.4, and 386.3 keV) and $\gamma$-ray from $^{53}$Mn (377.8 keV) are also observed in (b).}
