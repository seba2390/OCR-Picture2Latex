\begin{abstract}
For $\Cc$ a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero we show:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Cc$ always contains a simple projective object;
\item if $\Cc$ is in addition ribbon, the internal characters of projective modules span a submodule for the projective $SL(2,\Zb)$-action;
\item 
	the action of the Grothendieck ring 
of $\Cc$ on the span of
	internal characters of projective objects can be diagonalised;
\item the linearised Grothendieck ring of $\Cc$ is semisimple iff $\Cc$ is semisimple.
\end{enumerate}
Results 1--3 remain true in positive characteristic under an extra assumption. 
Result~1 implies that the tensor ideal of projective objects in $\Cc$ carries a unique-up-to-scalars modified trace function.
We express the modified trace of open Hopf links coloured by projectives in terms of  $S$-matrix elements.
Furthermore, we give a Verlinde-like formula for the decomposition of tensor products of projective objects which uses only the modular 
$S$-transformation restricted to
	internal characters of projective objects.

We compute 
the modified trace
 in the example of symplectic fermion categories, and we illustrate how the Verlinde-like formula for projective objects can be applied there.

\section{Introduction}

Let $H$ be a finite-dimensional quasi-triangular Hopf algebra over a field $k$
and denote by $R$ its universal $R$-matrix.
$H$ is called {\em factorisable} if the map 
$H^* \to H:
f\mapsto (f\otimes\id)(R_{21}R)$ 
(the {\em Drinfeld map} \cite{Drinfeld}) is bijective. If $H$ is factorisable and ribbon, the centre $Z(H)$ of $H$ carries a projective representation of $SL(2,\Zb)$, the mapping class group of the torus \cite{Lyubashenko:1994ab}. In this case, the Drinfeld map furthermore allows one to give a faithful representation of the 
	$k$-linear
Grothendieck ring of $\Rep(H)$ on $Z(H)$ \cite{Drinfeld}.

A factorisable Hopf algebra $H$ can be endowed with a central form $\nu : H \to k$ such that it becomes a symmetric Frobenius algebra \cite[Rem.\,3.1]{Cohen:2008}. The central form $\nu$ induces an isomorphism between $Z(H)$ and the space $C(H)$ of all central forms on $H$:
\be\label{eq:intro-Z-C}
	Z(H) \longrightarrow C(H)	
	\quad , \quad
	z \longmapsto \nu(z \cdot -) \ .
\ee
Characters of finite-dimensional $H$-modules are examples of central forms. We are particularly interested in the preimage in $Z(H)$ of the characters of projective modules. This subspace is called the {\em Higman ideal} $\Hig(H)$ 
	(see e.g.\ \cite{Broue:2009}). 


Denote by $\Rep(H)$ the category of finite-dimensional representations of $H$. 
In \cite{Cohen:2008}, Cohen and Westreich prove, amongst other things, the following remarkable results.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{Cohen:2008}]\label{thm:cw-hopf-results}
Let $H$ be a factorisable ribbon Hopf algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is at least one simple and projective $H$-module.
\item $\Hig(H)$ is an $SL(2,\Zb)$-submodule of $Z(H)$.
\item $\Hig(H)$ is a submodule for the action of the Grothendieck ring of $\Rep(H)$ on $Z(H)$, and this action can be diagonalised on $\Hig(H)$ (``the fusion rules can be diagonalised on $\Hig(H)$'').
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Part 2 generalises~\cite[Thm.\,5.5]{Lachowska-center}, 
\cite[Cor.\,4.1]{Lachowska-Verlinde} 
established for small quantum groups associated to simple Lie algebras of ADE type.



\medskip
The motivation of the present paper is to give a generalisation of these results to factorisable finite tensor categories. Let us describe our setting in more detail.

Let $k$ be a field. An abelian $k$-linear category is called {\em finite} if it is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. A {\em finite tensor category} is a finite abelian category which is rigid monoidal with bilinear tensor product and simple tensor unit. 
	If the category is equipped with a natural monoidal isomorphism from the identity functor to the endofunctor given by taking double duals, it is called {\em pivotal}.
An important class of examples of finite tensor categories are the categories $\Rep(H)$ for finite-dimensional Hopf algebras $H$. 
	A Hopf algebra $H$ is called pivotal if the squared antipode of $H$ is given by conjugating with a group-like element~\cite{AAGTV}. In this case,  $\Rep(H)$ is pivotal. A ribbon Hopf algebra is automatically pivotal.

For a braided finite tensor category one can write down at least four natural non-degeneracy 
	conditions
for the braiding. These have only recently been shown to all be equivalent \cite{Shimizu:2016}, and we briefly review this result in Section~\ref{sec:conventions}. We refer to braided finite tensor categories satisfying these equivalent conditions as {\em factorisable}. Indeed, for a quasi-triangular finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H$, $\Rep(H)$ is factorisable iff $H$ is factorisable~\cite{Lyubashenko:1995}.

Our first main result generalises part 1 of Theorem~\ref{thm:cw-hopf-results} 
(see Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj}).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intro2}
A factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category $\Cc$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero contains a simple projective object.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
One can formulate the above theorem for positive characteristic if one adds an extra assumption, which we call ``Condition~P'' (Section~\ref{sec:projsimpleex}). Namely, we say that a finite braided tensor category satisfies Condition~P if there exists a projective object $P$ such that~$[P]$ is not nilpotent in the linearised Grothendieck ring (that is, in the Grothendieck ring tensored with the field). In characteristic zero, Condition~P is always satisfied (Lemma~\ref{lem:powers-nonzero-in-Gr}). 
Theorems~\ref{thm:intro2}, \ref{thm:intro3} and part 1 of Theorem~\ref{thm:intro5} 
remain true if instead of requiring the field to be of characteristic zero, one demands that the category satisfies Condition~P
(but for part 2 of Theorem~\ref{thm:intro5} we still need to require characteristic zero). 
The details are given in the body of the paper. 
\end{remark}

One noteworthy consequence is that the category $\Cc$ in the above theorem allows for 
a unique-up-to-scalars non-zero modified trace function
on the tensor ideal $\Proj(\Cc)$, 
that is, on the full subcategory of all projective objects in $\Cc$
	\cite{Geer:2010,Geer:2011a,Geer:2011b}, see Section~\ref{sec:traces}. 

A modified  trace on $\Proj(\Cc)$ is a family of $k$-linear maps $t_P : \End(P) \to k$, $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$, subject to a cyclicity and partial trace condition.
Recall that the 
categorical trace defined in terms of the pivotal structure on $\Cc$  vanishes identically on $\Proj(\Cc)$ 
unless $\Cc$ is semisimple
(Remark~\ref{rem:modified-trace-consequences}). In contrast to this, for the modified trace the
pairings $\Cc(P,Q) \times \Cc(Q,P) \to k$, 
	$(f,g) \mapsto t_Q(f \circ g)$ 
are non-degenerate for all $P,Q \in \Proj(\Cc)$ 
(see \cite{Costantino:2014sma} and Proposition~\ref{prop:mtrace} below).
In particular, the $t_P$ turn $\Proj(\Cc)$ into a Calabi-Yau category (Definition~\ref{def:CY-cat}).

One can use modified traces to define new link invariants in finite ribbon categories which are not accessible via the usual quantum 
traces~\cite{Geer:2009}. However, we will not pursue this point in the present paper.

\medskip

Let $\Ac$ be a finite abelian category over a field $k$ and assume that $\Proj(\Ac)$ is Calabi-Yau.
In Section~\ref{sec:sym-alg-ideal} we give a categorical definition of the Higman ideal as an ideal 
\be
	\Hig(\Ac) ~\subset~ \End(\Id_\Ac)
\ee
in the algebra of
natural endomorphisms of the identity functor on $\Ac$.
Recall that for algebras, $Z(A) \cong \End(\Id_{\rmod{A}})$, i.e.\ the centre of $A$ is isomorphic as a $k$-algebra to the
algebra of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor on the category of finite-dimensional (right, say) $A$-modules. The definition of $\Hig(\Ac)$ is such that via this isomorphism, $\Hig(A)$ gets mapped to $\Hig(\rmod{A})$.

	As in Theorem~\ref{thm:intro2} 
above, let $\Cc$ be a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. 
Let $G$ be a projective generator of $\Cc$ and $E = \End(G)$. Then $\Cc$ is equivalent as a $k$-linear category to $\rmod{E}$. As discussed above, we obtain a modified trace $t_G : E \to k$ which turns $E$ into a symmetric Frobenius algebra, and as in \eqref{eq:intro-Z-C} we get isomorphisms
\be\label{eq:intro-End-Z-C}
	\End(\Id_\Cc) \longrightarrow Z(E) \longrightarrow C(E)
	\quad , \quad
	\eta \longmapsto \eta_G \longmapsto t_G(\eta_G \circ -) \ .
\ee
Our second main result is Theorem~\ref{thm:trace-vs-tG}, which links characters of $E$-modules to
	the modified trace over certain elements in $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ obtained from the internal character of the corresponding object in $\Cc$. 
The details of this are
too lengthy for this introduction, and we refer to Section~\ref{sec:ch-tr}.

Theorem~\ref{thm:trace-vs-tG} is important 	for what follows  as it implies that $\Hig(\Cc)$ is spanned by the
	images of	
internal characters of projective objects (Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span}).

\medskip

For a factorisable finite ribbon category one obtains a projective $SL(2,\Zb)$-action on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$, and in fact actions of all surface mapping class groups on appropriate Hom-spaces \cite{Lyubashenko:1994tm}.

Our third main result generalises part 2 of Theorem~\ref{thm:cw-hopf-results} (see Corollary~\ref{cor:Hig-SL2Z-sub})

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intro3}
Let $\Cc$ be a factorisable finite ribbon category over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Then $\Hig(\Cc)$ is an $SL(2,\Zb)$-submodule of $\End(\Id_\Cc)$.
\end{theorem}

We note that under the conditions of this theorem, $\Hig(\Cc)=\End(\Id_\Cc)$ iff $\Cc$ is semisimple (Proposition~\ref{prop:cy-ssi-inclusion}).

Still under the conditions of the above theorem, one can define an injective ring homomorphism from the Grothendieck ring $\Gr(\Cc)$ to $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ \cite{Shimizu:2015} (see Section~\ref{sec:conventions}). 
This, in particular, turns $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ into a faithful $\Gr(\Cc)$-module by defining the representation map 
	$\rho^L : \Gr(\Cc) \to \End_k(\End(\Id_\Cc))$ 
to be left multiplication. 
We show the following statement, the first part of which generalises part 3 
of Theorem~\ref{thm:cw-hopf-results} (see Proposition~\ref{prop:GrC-diagonalisability}).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:intro5}
Let $\Cc$ be a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field
	of characteristic zero.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The restriction of $\rho^L$ to the submodule $\Hig(\Cc)$ is diagonalisable.
\item The action $\rho^L$ can be diagonalised on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ if and only if $\Cc$ is semisimple.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

See Proposition~\ref{prop:GrC-diagonalisability} for an explicit choice of basis diagonalising the $\Gr(\Cc)$-action. 
In particular, the $k$-linear Grothendieck ring $\Gr_k(\Cc)$ is semisimple iff $\Cc$ is semisimple (Corollary~\ref{cor:Grss-Css}).

\smallskip

We also investigate in Section~\ref{sec:Sinv-proj} how the restriction of the 
	projective
$SL(2,\Zb)$-action to $\Hig(\Cc)$ can be used to gain information about the decomposition of tensor products of projective objects, see Proposition~\ref{prop:M-via-S} for details.
 This can be thought of as a non-semisimple variant 
of the Verlinde formula \cite{Verlinde:1988sn}. 
See e.g.\ \cite{Fuchs:2003yu,Fuchs:2006nx,Gainutdinov:2016qhz,Creutzig:2016fms} for discussions of the Verlinde formula in the finitely non-semisimple setting, and~\cite{Cohen:2008} for a related result in the context of factorisable ribbon Hopf algebras.
As a corollary of the projective
$SL(2,\Zb)$-action on $\Hig(\Cc)$, we also give  a purely categorical counterpart
of the conjectural relation between modular properties of pseudo-trace functions and modified trace of Hopf link operators  \cite{Creutzig:2016fms} --- we prove a special case of this (namely when all labels are projective) in Proposition~\ref{prop:mod-tr-S}.


\begin{remark}\label{rem:motivation}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item 
A semisimple factorisable finite ribbon category is a modular tensor category \cite{tur,baki}. Since the qualifier ``modular'' refers to the projective action of the modular group $SL(2,\Zb)$, it would also be reasonable to refer to modular tensor categories in the sense of \cite{tur,baki} as {\em modular fusion categories}, and to call factorisable finite ribbon categories {\em modular finite tensor categories}. An important application of modular fusion categories is that they are precisely the data needed to construct certain three-dimensional topological field theories \cite{retu,tur,Bartlett:2015baa}.
For modular finite tensor categories in the above sense, a corresponding result is not known. However, a version of three-dimensional topological field theory build form such categories is studied in \cite{Kerler:2001}.
\item
	So far,
we have motivated our results from the theory of Hopf algebras. 
Another reason to look at factorisable finite tensor categories is provided by vertex operator algebras. A particularly benign 
class of vertex operator algebras $V$ are the so-called $C_2$-cofinite ones, for which we in addition require that they are simple, non-negatively graded and isomorphic to their contragredient module. Let $V$ be such a vertex operator algebra.

If $\Rep(V)$, the category of (quasi-finite dimensional, generalised) $V$-modules, is in addition semisimple, it is in fact a modular fusion category \cite{Huang2005}.	What is more, it is proved in \cite{Zhu1996} that the characters of $V$-modules form a projective representation of the modular group, which by \cite{Huang:2004bn} agrees with the representation obtained from the modular fusion category $\Rep(V)$.

If $\Rep(V)$ is not semisimple, 
it is known from \cite{Huang:2010,Huang:2007mj} that $\Rep(V)$ satisfies all properties of a finite braided tensor category except for rigidity (which is, however, conjectured in \cite{Huang:2009xq,Gainutdinov:2016qhz} and proven in a different setting for $W_p$ models in~\cite{Tsuchiya:2012ru}). 
It is furthermore conjectured that also in the non-semisimple case, $\Rep(V)$ is factorisable \cite{Gainutdinov:2016qhz,Creutzig:2016fms}.
For the modular group action one now has to pass to pseudo-trace functions \cite{Miyamoto:2002ar,Arike:2011ab}, and it is tempting to conjecture that this modular group action agrees with the one on $\End(\Id_{\Rep(V)})$ discussed above, see \cite[Conj.\,5.10]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz} for a precise formulation. 
For so-called symplectic fermion conformal field theories \cite{Kausch:1995py,Gaberdiel:1996np,Abe:2005}, the modular group actions obtained from pseudo-trace functions and from $\Rep(V)$ have been compared in \cite{Gainutdinov:2015lja,FGRprep2} and they indeed agree.

If these conjectures were true,
 Theorems~\ref{thm:intro2} and \ref{thm:intro3} would imply that such a~$V$ always has at least one simple and projective module, and that the characters (not the pseudo-trace functions) of projective modules transform into each other under the modular group action. Both properties hold in the very few non-semisimple examples where they can be verified 
\cite{Kausch:1995py,Fuchs:2003yu,[FGST],Nagatomo:2009xp,Abe:2005}.

The study of properties of factorisable tensor categories and in particular of $\Rep(V)$ is also important input for the construction of bulk
conformal field theory correlators in the non-semisimple setting as in \cite{Fuchs:2010mw,Fuchs:2013lda,Fuchs:2016wjr}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

We conclude the paper in Section~\ref{sec:sf-example} with the computation of the modified trace
in a class of examples of factorisable finite ribbon categories 
\cite{Davydov:2012xg,Runkel:2012cf}
arising in symplectic fermion conformal field theories.
We also illustrate in this example how the projective $SL(2,\Zb)$-action on the Higman ideal can be used to obtain information about the tensor product of projective objects.

\textbf{Convention}:
Through this paper, $k$ denotes an algebraically closed field, possibly of positive characteristic.\footnote{
	Some definitions and results of this paper do not actually require algebraic closedness of $k$. For example, algebraic closedness is not required in the first half of Section \ref{sec:conventions}, up to and excluding Theorem~\ref{thm:chiinj}, 
or in the definition of a modified right trace in Section \ref{sec:traces}, etc. But to avoid confusion we prefer to require algebraic closedness for the entire paper.}

 

\section{Factorisable finite tensor categories}\label{sec:conventions}

In this section we introduce notation and recall some definitions and results that will be used later, such as the different characterisations of a factorisable finite tensor category. The reader is invited to just skim through this section and return to it when necessary.

\medskip

For $\Ac$ an
	essentially small
abelian category we write (see e.g.\ \cite{EGNO-book} for more details)
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Irr(\Ac)$: a choice of representatives for the isomorphism classes of simple objects 
of~$\Ac$, i.e.\ every simple object is isomorphic to one and only one element of $\Irr(\Ac)$, 
\item $\Proj(\Ac)$: the full subcategory of $\Ac$ consisting of all projective objects,
\item $\Gr(\Ac)$: the Grothendieck group of $\Ac$. We write $[X] \in \Gr(\Ac)$ for the class of $X \in \Ac$ in the Grothendieck group,
\item $\Gr_k(\Ac)$: if $\Ac$ is $k$-linear
we set $\Gr_k(\Ac) := k \otimes_\Zb \Gr(\Ac)$. Note that the canonical ring homomorphism $\Gr(\Ac) \to \Gr_k(\Ac)$ is injective iff $k$ has characteristic zero.
\end{itemize}
A $k$-linear abelian category $\Ac$ is called {\em locally finite} if all Hom-spaces are finite dimensional over $k$ and every object of $\Ac$ has finite length. A locally finite abelian category is called {\em finite} if $\Irr(\Ac)$ is finite and every simple object has a projective cover. For a finite abelian category $\Ac$ we set
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_U$: a choice of projective cover $\pi_U : P_U \to U$ for each simple $U \in \Irr(\Ac)$.
\end{itemize}

One can show that a $k$-linear abelian category is finite iff it is equivalent as
	a
$k$-linear category to the category of finite-dimensional modules over a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra.

For a finite abelian category $\Ac$ we have $\Gr(\Ac) = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} \Zb\, [U]$. (On the other hand, if infinite direct sums are allowed in $\Ac$ we have $\Gr(\Ac)=0$ because of the short exact sequence $X \to \bigoplus_{\mathbb{N}} X \to \bigoplus_{\mathbb{N}} X$.)

\medskip

A monoidal category $\Mc$ is called {\em rigid} if for each $X \in \Mc$ there is  $X^* \in \Mc$ 
(the {\em left dual}) and 
$\ldX$ (the {\em right dual}), together with morphisms
\begin{align}
	\ev_X &: X^* \otimes X \to \one \ ,
	& \coev_X &: \one \to X \otimes X^* \ ,
\nonumber \\
	\widetilde\ev_X &: X \otimes \ldX \to \one \ ,
	& \widetilde\coev_X &: \one \to \ldX \otimes X \ ,
\end{align}
where $\one \in \Mc$ is the tensor unit. These morphisms have to satisfy the zig-zag identities, see e.g.\ \cite{EGNO-book} for more details.
We will later use string diagram notation. Our diagrams will be read bottom to top and the above duality morphisms will be written as

A monoidal category $\Mc$ with left duals is {\em pivotal} if it is equipped with a natural monoidal isomorphism 
\be
	\delta : \Id_{\Mc} \to (-)^{**} \ .
\ee
It is then automatically rigid via $\ldX := X^*$ and (we omit the tensor product between objects for better readability)
\begin{align}\label{eq:ev-coev-tilde}
	\widetilde\ev_X &~=~ \big[\, XX^* \xrightarrow{\delta_X \otimes \id} X^{**} X^* \xrightarrow{\ev_{X^*}} \one \,\big] \ ,

	\widetilde\coev_X &~=~ \big[\, \one \xrightarrow{\coev_{X^*}}X^{*} X^{**} 
	\xrightarrow{\id \otimes \delta_X^{-1}} X^{*} X \,\big] \ .
\end{align}

Let $\Mc$ be a monoidal category with right duals. Below we will make use of the functor ${}^*(-) \otimes (-) : \Mc^{\mathrm{op}} \times \Mc \to \Mc$, $(X,Y) \mapsto \ldX \otimes Y$, and of dinatural transformations between this functor and the constant functor with value $X$ for some $X \in \Mc$. We refer to \cite{MacLane-book} for dinatural transformations in general and 
	to \cite[Sec.\,4]{Fuchs:2010mw} or \cite[Sec.\,3]{FGRprep1}
for these specific functors. 

The following lemma is a slight generalisation of 
\cite[Lem.\,2.5.1]{Geer:2010} which in turn follows \cite{Deligne:2004}.
	It is proven in the same way as in \cite{Geer:2010} and we relegate the proof to Appendix~\ref{app:dinat-exact}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:dinat-Gr}
Let $\Mc$ be an
abelian monoidal category with right duals and biexact tensor product functor.
Suppose that there is a projective object $P \in \Mc$ and a surjection $p : P \to \one$.
Let $X \in \Mc$ and let
$\eta$ be a dinatural transformation from ${}^*(-) \otimes(-)$ to $X$. Consider the following commuting diagram in $\Mc$ with exact rows:
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_diag}
\xymatrix{
 0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r]^f \ar[d]^a & B \ar[r]^g \ar[d]^b & C \ar[r] \ar[d]^c & 0
\\
 0 \ar[r] & A \ar[r]^f & B \ar[r]^g & C \ar[r] & 0
 }
\ee
In this case, the following equality of morphisms $\one \to X$ holds
for any choice of endomorphisms $a$, $b$,  and $c$
	that make \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_diag} 
commute:
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_rel}
\eta_B \circ (\id_{{\rule{0pt}{6pt}}^*\hspace{-2pt}B} \otimes b) \circ \widetilde\coev_B
~=~
\eta_A \circ (\id_{\,{\rule{0pt}{6pt}}^*\hspace{-2.5pt}A} \otimes a) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
+
\eta_C \circ (\id_{{\rule{0pt}{6pt}}^*\hspace{-1pt}C} \otimes c) \circ \widetilde\coev_C \ .
\ee
\end{lemma}


\begin{remark}\label{rem:all-endo-are-id}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item 
A corresponding statement as that in Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr} holds for a dinatural transformation $\xi$ from $(-) \otimes (-)^*$ to $X$. In this case, for $a,b,c$ as in \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_diag} we have
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_rel2}
\xi_B \circ (b \otimes \id_{B^*}) \circ \coev_B
~=~
\xi_A \circ (a \otimes \id_{A^*}) \circ \coev_A
\,+\,
\xi_C \circ (c \otimes \id_{C^*}) \circ \coev_C
\ .
\ee
\item
As a consequence of Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr}, the morphism $\eta_A \circ \widetilde\coev_A \in \Mc(\one,X)$ only depends on the class $[A] \in \Gr(\Mc)$. Indeed, if one chooses $a,b,c$ in \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_diag} to be identities, then \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_rel} states that given a short exact sequence 
$0\to A \to B \to C\to 0$ 
we have the identity
\be
\eta_B \circ \widetilde\coev_B
~=~
\eta_A \circ \widetilde\coev_A
+
\eta_C \circ \widetilde\coev_C
\ee
of morphisms in $\Mc(\one,X)$. For example, if $\Mc$ is in addition pivotal, one can take $X=\one$ and the dinatural transformation $\eta_A = \ev_A$. One obtains the statement that the quantum dimension only depends on the class in $\Gr(\Mc)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}


A {\em finite tensor category} $\Cc$ is a category which (see \cite{Etingof:2003})
\begin{itemize}
\item is a $k$-linear finite abelian category,
\item is a rigid monoidal category with $k$-bilinear tensor product functor,
\item has a simple tensor unit.
\end{itemize}
The tensor product functor of an abelian rigid monoidal category is automatically biadditive and biexact \cite[Prop.\,4.2.1]{EGNO-book}.
A finite tensor category is called {\em unimodular} if $(P_\one)^* \cong P_\one$, see \cite{Etingof:2004,EGNO-book} for more details.

The following technical corollary to Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr} generalises \cite[Cor.\,2.5.2]{Geer:2010} and will be needed later. The proof is given in Appendix~\ref{app:dinat-exact}.


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:dinat-jac-0}
Let $\Cc$ be a finite tensor category over
$k$. 
Let $X \in \Cc$ and let
$\eta$ be a dinatural transformation from ${}^*(-) \otimes(-)$ to $X$
and $\xi$ from $(-) \otimes(-)^*$ to $X$.
Let $A \in \Cc$ and $f \in \End(A)$ be such that for all simple $U \in \Cc$ and all $u : A \to U$ we have $u \circ f = 0$.
 Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
$\eta_A \circ (\id \otimes f) \circ \widetilde\coev_A = 0$ and
$\xi_A \circ (f \otimes \id) \circ \coev_A = 0$.
\item If $\Cc$ is in addition braided 
	and pivotal,
then for any $B \in \Cc$,
\be \label{eq:f-loop-zero}

\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}


For the rest of this section, we fix
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Cc$: a braided and pivotal finite tensor category 
	over $k$.
\end{itemize}
Our notation for the coherence and braiding isomorphisms in $\Cc$ is, for $U,V,W \in \Cc$,
\begin{align}
\alpha_{U,V,W} &\,:\; U \otimes (V \otimes W) \longrightarrow (U \otimes V) \otimes W
& \text{(associator)} \ ,
\nonumber \\
\lambda_U &\,:\; \one \otimes U \longrightarrow U
\quad , \quad
\rho_U \,:\; U \otimes \one \longrightarrow U
& \text{(unit isomorphisms)} \ ,
\nonumber \\
c_{U,V} &\,:\; U \otimes V \longrightarrow V \otimes U
& \text{(braiding)} \ .
\end{align}
We write $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ for the natural endomorphisms of the identity functor 
on $\Cc$.  

\medskip

Given $V \in \Cc$, consider the natural transformation $\smap(V) 
\in \End(\Id_\Cc)$: for all $X \in \Cc$,
\begin{align}
	\smap(V)_X
&~=~
\big[
 X 
\xrightarrow{\sim} \one X
\xrightarrow{\widetilde\coev_{V} \ot \id} (V^{*} V) X

\label{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic}
\end{align}
where in (*) we used properties of the braiding
to deform the string diagram, as well as pivotality to exchange left and right duality morphisms. 
This natural transformation appears
	in \cite[Sec.\,I.1.5]{tur} and
 also in \cite{Costantino:2014sma,Creutzig:2016fms} where it is called 
 ``general Hopf link'' and
 ``open Hopf link operator'', respectively
	(see~\cite[Rem.\,3.10\,(2)]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz}
	 for the conventions used here).

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:sigma_Gr_ringhom}
$\sigma(V)$ only depends on the class of $V$ in $\Gr(\Cc)$, and the resulting map $\Gr(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$
 is a ring homomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $X \in \Cc$ be arbitrary and
consider the dinatural transformation from $(-)^* \otimes(-)$ to $X \otimes X^*$ given by
	(see also \cite[Sec.\,4.4]{FGRprep1})
\be
	\eta_V ~:=~   
	\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\setlength{\unitlength}{.75pt}

     \put (67,128) {\scriptsize$ X^* $}
     }\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}}
  \end{picture}}
 \quad .
\ee
Note that $(\sigma(V)_X \otimes \id_{X^*}) \circ \coev_X = \eta_V \circ \widetilde\coev_V$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr} (or rather Remark~\ref{rem:all-endo-are-id}\,(2)), the right hand side factors through $\Gr(\Cc)$, 
hence so does $\sigma$.
That the resulting map is a ring map follows from the identity $\sigma(V \otimes W)_X = \sigma(V)_X \circ \sigma(W)_X$, which one can verify by a straightforward calculation~\cite[Sec.\,4.5]{tur}
(see also \cite[Sec.\,3.1]{Creutzig:2016fms}).
\end{proof}

By abuse of notation, we also use the symbol $\smap$ for the resulting ring homomorphism
\be\label{eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def}
\smap : \Gr(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc) \quad ,\quad \smap([V])_X \text{ is given by \eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic}} \ .
\ee

Let $\coend$ be the coend 
(see e.g.\ \cite{Kerler:2001} or the review
 in~\cite[Sec.\,4]{Fuchs:2010mw} or in~\cite[Sec.\,3]{FGRprep1})
\be
	\coend ~=\, \int^{X \in \Cc} \hspace{-.5em} X^* \ot X 
\ee
and denote by 
$\iota_X : X^* \ot X \to \coend$, $X \in \Cc$,
the corresponding dinatural transformation.
The coend $\coend$ exists since $\Cc$ is a finite tensor category (see e.g.\ \cite[Cor.\,5.1.8]{Kerler:2001}). It carries the structure of a Hopf algebra
in $\Cc$ and is equipped with a Hopf pairing $\omega : \coend \ot \coend \to \one$ \cite{Lyubashenko:1995}. 
We denote the product, coproduct, unit, counit and antipode of the Hopf algebra $\coend$ by $\mu_\coend$, $\Delta_\coend$, $\eta_\coend$, $\eps_\coend$, $S_\coend$, respectively	(we use the conventions in \cite[Sec.\,3]{FGRprep1}).

If $\Cc$ is unimodular,
the coend $\coend$ admits a 
	two-sided
integral $\Lambda_\coend : \one \to \coend$
\cite[Thm.\,6.8]{Shimizu:2014}.\footnote{
	For factorisable $\Cc$ (see Definition~\ref{def:factorisable} below), the existence of two-sided integrals has been shown in \cite[Thm.\,6.11]{Lyubashenko:1995}, see also \cite[Cor.\,5.2.11]{Kerler:2001}.}
The integral is unique up to a scalar factor. 
Dually, $\coend$ admits a
	two-sided
 cointegral
  $\coint_\coend : \coend \to \one$ which can be normalised such that $\coint_\coend \circ \Lambda_\coend = \id_\one$ (see e.g.\ \cite[Sec.\,4.2.3]{Kerler:2001}).

We will need the linear maps 
\be
\xymatrix{
\End(\Id_\Cc)
 \ar[r]^{\psi}
 &
\Cc(\coend,\one)
 \ar@/^1pc/[r]^{\Rad}
 &
\Cc(\one,\coend)
\ar@/^1pc/[l]_\Omega
}
\quad ,
\ee
which are defined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item
For $\alpha \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$, the value $\psi(\alpha)$ is defined uniquely by the universal property of the coend
	$(\coend,\iota)$
via,  for all $X \in \Cc$,
\be
	\psi(\alpha) \circ \iota_X = \ev_X \circ (\id \ot \alpha_X) \ .
\ee
\item
$\Omega$ is defined via the Hopf pairing of $\coend$ as, for $f : \one \to \coend$,
\be\label{eq:Omega-def}
	\Omega(f) = \big[\, \coend \xrightarrow{\sim} \one \coend \xrightarrow{f \otimes \id} \coend\coend \xrightarrow{\omega} \one \,\big]	 \ . 
\ee
\item
The definition of $\rho$ requires $\Cc$ to be unimodular and the choice of a non-zero integral $\Lambda_\coend : 1 \to \coend$. In this case we set, for $g : \coend \to \one$,
\be\label{eq:rho-def}
	\rho(g) = \big[\, \one \xrightarrow{\Lambda_\coend} \coend \xrightarrow{\Delta_\coend} \coend\coend \xrightarrow{g \otimes \id} \one \coend \xrightarrow{\sim} \coend \,\big]	 \ . 
\ee
\end{itemize}

The bialgebra structure on
	$\coend$
allows one to endow $\Cc(\one,\coend)$ and $\Cc(\coend,\one)$ with the structure of a $k$-algebra. $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ is equally a $k$-algebra. We have:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Omega-rho-properties}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\psi$ is an isomorphism of $k$-algebras.
\item $\Omega$ is a $k$-algebra homomorphism (but not necessarily an isomorphism).
\item For $\Cc$ unimodular,
$\Rad$ is an isomorphism (but not necessarily a $k$-algebra homomorphism).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

For the proof of this lemma, see e.g.\ \cite{Lyubashenko:1995}, 
\cite[Prop.\,5.2.5]{Kerler:2001},
\cite[Cor.\,4.2.13]{Kerler:2001}
and
\cite[Sec.\,3.1]{Shimizu:2016}
(and also \cite[Sec.\,2]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz}).
One verifies that the inverses of $\psi$ and $\rho$ are, for $X \in \Cc$, $f : \coend \to \one$, $g : \one \to \coend$,
\begin{align}
	\psi^{-1}(f)_X &~=~ \big[ X \xrightarrow{\sim} \one X
	\xrightarrow{\coev_X \ot \id} (X  X^*)  X
	\xrightarrow{\sim} X  (X^*  X)
	\xrightarrow{\id \ot \iota_X} X \coend
	\xrightarrow{\id \ot f} X \one
	\xrightarrow{\sim} X\big] \ ,
	\nonumber\\
\Rad^{-1}(g) &~=~ \big[\, \coend \xrightarrow{\sim} \one \coend \xrightarrow{g \ot \id} \coend\coend
\xrightarrow{S_\coend \ot \id} \coend\coend \xrightarrow{\mu_\coend} \coend \xrightarrow{\coint_\coend} \one \,\big] \ .
\end{align}

The {\em internal character}	of $V \in \Cc$ is the element $\chi_V \in \Cc(\one,\coend)$ given by 
\cite{Fuchs:2010mw,Shimizu:2015} 
(we use the convention in \cite{Gainutdinov:2016qhz})
\be\label{eq:chiV-def}
	\chi_V ~=~ 
	\big[\, \one \xrightarrow{\widetilde\coev_V} V^* \ot V   \xrightarrow{\iota_{V}} \coend \,\big] \ .
\ee
By Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr}, this map factors through the Grothendieck ring, i.e.\ we obtain a map 
\be
\chi :\; \Gr(\Cc) \to \Cc(\one,\coend), \qquad [V] \mapsto \chi_V\ .
\ee
 By abuse of notation, we will denote the induced map $\Gr_k(\Cc) \to \Cc(\one,\coend)$, 
$1 \otimes_\Zb [V] \mapsto \chi_V$ by $\chi$ as well.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Sec.\,4.5]{Fuchs:2010mw} and \cite[Thm.\,3.11, Prop.\,3.14, Cor.\,4.2, Thm.\,5.12]{Shimizu:2015}}]~
\label{thm:chiinj}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The linear map $\chi : \Gr_k(\Cc) \to \Cc(\one,\coend)$ is an injective $k$-algebra homomorphism. 
\item
Suppose in addition that $\Cc$ is unimodular. Then $\chi$ is surjective iff $\Cc$ is semisimple.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

This theorem
	remains true for $\Cc$ not braided
(but still a pivotal finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field).

Define, 	for
	$\Cc$ unimodular and 
$M \in \Cc$,
\be\label{eq:tildechi-def}
\phi_M ~:=~ \psi^{-1}\big(\Rad^{-1}(\chi_M)\big) ~\in~ \End(\Id_\Cc)\ .
\ee
After substituting the definitions, 	one can check that, for all $X \in \Cc$,
\be\label{eq:phi_M-explicit}
	(\phi_M)_X ~= 
	  \raisebox{-0.5\height}{\setlength{\unitlength}{.75pt}
  \begin{picture}(100,231)

     \put (86,139) {\scriptsize$ M $}
     }\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}}
  \end{picture}}
 \quad .
\ee
As $\chi_M$ only depends on $[M] \in \Gr(\Cc)$, so does $\phi_M$.
Since $\psi$ and $\Rad$ are isomorphisms, by Theorem~\ref{thm:chiinj} the set $\{\, \phi_U \,|\, U \in \Irr(\Cc)\,\}$ is linearly independent in $\End(\Id_\Cc)$.
We note that since $\rho$ is not necessarily an algebra map, neither is the linear map $\Gr_k(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$, $[M] \mapsto \phi_M$.

We define the linear map $\mathscr{S}_\Cc : \End(\Id_\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$, the {\em modular $S$-transformation}, as
\be\label{eq:SC-def}
\mathscr{S}_\Cc ~=~ \big[\, \End(\Id_\Cc) \xrightarrow{\,\psi\,} \Cc(\coend,\one) \xrightarrow{~\Rad~} \Cc(\one,\coend) \xrightarrow{~\Omega~} \Cc(\coend,\one) \xrightarrow{~\psi^{-1}~} \End(\Id_\Cc) \, \big] \ .
\ee
We have seen that $\psi$ and $\Omega$ are algebra maps, while $\Rad$ is in general not.
Thus in general $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ is not an algebra map, either.
Recall the definition of $\smap$ in \eqref{eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def}.
A straightforward calculation shows that $\smap([M]) = \psi^{-1}\circ \Omega (\chi_M)$. Combining this with \eqref{eq:tildechi-def} and \eqref{eq:SC-def} gives, for all $M \in \Cc$,
\be\label{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM}
	\smap([M]) ~=~ \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_M) \ ,
\ee
cf.\ \cite[Rem.\,3.10\,(2)]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz}.
 In particular, by Lemma~\ref{lem:sigma_Gr_ringhom}, the combination $[M] \mapsto \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_M)$ is an algebra homomorphism from $\Gr_k(\Cc)$ to $\End(\Id_\Cc)$.

\begin{remark}
Since the coend $\coend$ is unique up to unique isomorphism, and the cointegral $\coint_\coend$ is unique up to sign, 
it is straightforward to verify that
the $\phi_M$, $M \in \Cc$ and $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ depend on the choice of 
$(\coend,\coint_\coend)$
only up to an overall sign, see \cite[Prop.\,5.3]{FGRprep1}. In particular, $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_M)$ is independent of the choice of 
$(\coend,\coint_\coend)$, as we already saw explicitly in \eqref{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM}.
\end{remark}

Next we introduce 
	four equivalent 
non-degeneracy requirement for the braiding. (This does not require a pivotal structure, hence we use the letter $\mathcal{D}$ and reserve $\Cc$ for the pivotal case as declared above.)

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Thm.\,1.1]{Shimizu:2016}}]\label{thm:factequiv}
Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a braided finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field.
The following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every transparent object in $\mathcal{D}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of tensor units. ($T \in\mathcal{D}$ is {\em transparent} if for all $X \in \mathcal{D}$, $c_{X,T} \circ c_{T,X} = \id_{T\ot X}$.)
\item The canonical braided monoidal functor 
$\mathcal{D} \boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{D}} \to \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{D})$ 
is an equivalence. (Here, $\boxtimes$ is the Deligne product, $\overline{\mathcal{D}}$ is the same tensor category as $\mathcal{D}$, but has inverse braiding, 
and $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{D})$ is the Drinfeld centre of $\mathcal{D}$.)
\item The pairing $\omega : \coend \ot \coend \to \one$ is non-degenerate (in the sense that there exists a copairing $\one \to \coend \ot \coend$).
\item $\Omega$ is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}\label{def:factorisable}
$\mathcal{D}$ as in Theorem~\ref{thm:factequiv} is called {\em factorisable} if it satisfies the equivalent conditions 
1--4 there.
\end{definition}


	In \cite[Prop.\,4.5]{Etingof:2004} the following result is proved (using formulation 2 of factorisability in Theorem~\ref{thm:factequiv}):

\begin{theorem} 
Let $\Cc$ be factorisable. Then $\Cc$ is unimodular.
\end{theorem}

In particular, for factorisable $\Cc$ the Hopf algebra given by the coend $\coend$ admits integrals and cointegrals.
Moreover, in this case we can normalise the integral such that
\be
	\omega \circ (\Lambda_\coend \ot \Lambda_\coend) = \id_\one \ ,
\ee
see e.g.\ \cite[Sec.\,5.2.3]{Kerler:2001}. Since the space of integrals is one-dimensional, this determines $\Lambda_\coend$ up to a sign.

\begin{remark}\label{rem:SC-iso-iff-fact}
Suppose $\Cc$ is factorisable. Then by the above theorem, $\Cc$ is unimodular and we have the isomorphism $\rho$ from \eqref{eq:rho-def} at our disposal (Lemma~\ref{lem:Omega-rho-properties}). Hence the linear endomorphism $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ of $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ in \eqref{eq:SC-def} is defined, and 
by condition 4 in Theorem~\ref{thm:factequiv}, $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ is invertible.
\end{remark}

Using Lemma~\ref{lem:sigma_Gr_ringhom} and \eqref{eq:tildechi-def}, \eqref{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM}, we get the following corollary to Theorem~\ref{thm:chiinj}.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:inj-alg-hom}
Let $\Cc$ be factorisable. Then the algebra map 
$\sigma \colon \Gr_k(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$
 is injective.
If in addition $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$, the ring homomorphism
 $\smap \colon \Gr(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$ is injective,
too.
\end{corollary}


The following important theorem is proved in \cite{Lyubashenko:1995},
see also 
	\cite[Sec.\,5.1]{FGRprep1} 
for a summary in the notation used here.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:proj-sl2Z-EndId}
Let $\Cc$ be factorisable and ribbon with ribbon twist
$\theta\in\End(\Id_\Cc)$. Then there is 
a projective representation of $SL(2,\Zb)$ on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ 
	for which the $S$ and $T$ generators act as
\be
\big(
\begin{smallmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{smallmatrix}
\big)
~\longmapsto~ \mathscr{S}_\Cc
\quad , \quad
\big(
\begin{smallmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{smallmatrix}
\big)
~\longmapsto~ \theta \circ (-)
\quad .
\ee
\end{theorem}


\begin{remark}
For $\Cc=\Rep H$ for $H$ a 
	finite-dimensional
ribbon Hopf algebra over $k$, we have $\one=k$, and the coend is given by $\coend = H^*$ with the coadjoint action \cite{Lyubashenko:1994tm,Kerler:1996}. 
Let $S$ be the antipode of $H$, $R$ the universal R-matrix, $v$ the ribbon element, and
   $u=\sum_{(R)}S(R_2)R_1$ the Drinfeld element.
We will
	(for the sake of this remark)
identify $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ with the centre $Z(H)$ of $H$.
Then we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The internal characters $\chi_V$ are the  $q$-characters:
the images $\chi_V(1)$
are linear forms on~$H$ 
invariant under the coadjoint action. They are the trace functions $\chi_V(1)=\mathrm{Tr}_V(u^{-1}v\,\cdot\,)$
introduced and studied in~\cite{Drinfeld},
	see also \cite{[Kerler]}.
\item
The map 
$S\circ
\psi^{-1}\circ\,\Omega$ is then \textit{the Drinfeld mapping} from the space of $q$-characters to $Z(H)$ given by 
$\chi(\cdot)\mapsto \sum_{(M)} \chi(M_1)M_2$ 
for the monodromy matrix $M=R_{21}R$,
see~\cite[Prop.\,1.2]{Drinfeld}. 
The central elements $\smap([V])_H$
(where $H$ is the left regular $H$-module)
are the images of $\mathrm{Tr}_V(u^{-1}v\,\cdot\,)$ under the Drinfeld mapping composed with~$S^{-1}$.

\item The map 
$S\circ
\psi^{-1}\circ\rho^{-1}$ is \textit{the Radford mapping} from the space of $q$-characters to $Z(H)$ 
given by  $\chi(\cdot)\mapsto (\chi\otimes\id)(\Delta(\boldsymbol{c}))$, for the (co)integral $\boldsymbol{c}\in H$ (that can be computed from $\coint_{\coend}$ using the duality maps),
see~\cite{R1} for properties of this map. 
	The
central elements $(\phi_V)_H$ from~\eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit}  are the images of $\mathrm{Tr}_V(u^{-1}v\,\cdot\,)$ under the Radford mapping 
	composed with~$S^{-1}$,
	see also \cite[Rem.\,7.10]{FGRprep1}.

\item 
The modular $S$-transformation on a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra was introduced in~\cite{Lyubashenko:1994ab}
following the categorical construction of~\cite{Lyubashenko:1995}. 
	The images of $\mathrm{Tr}_V(u^{-1}v\,\cdot\,)$ under the Drinfeld and Radford mappings are related by the modular 
$S$-trans\-for\-ma\-ti\-on~\cite[Sec.\,2]{[Kerler]}, see~\cite[Sec.\,5]{[FGST]} for the statement in this form. This result is generalised by~\eqref{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM}.

\section{Existence of a simple projective object}\label{sec:projsimpleex}

Throughout the rest of this paper, the following technical condition will play an important role.
\begin{quote}
{\bf Condition P}:
A finite tensor category $\mathcal{M}$ over $k$ satisfies 
{\em Condition~P} 
if there exists a projective object $P \in \mathcal{M}$ such that $[P]$ is not nilpotent in the linearised Grothendieck ring $\Gr_k(\mathcal{M})$.
\end{quote}
Two important classes of categories which satisfy Condition~P are described in the next two lemmas.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ssi-sat-condP}
Every semisimple finite tensor category $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies Condition~P.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\mathcal{M}$ is semisimple, every simple object is projective. Furthermore, for every simple object $U \in \mathcal{M}$, $[U]$ is non-zero in $\Gr_k(\mathcal{M})$. Hence we may take $P = \one$, the tensor unit. Then for all $m>0$, $[\one]^m = [\one] \neq 0$ in $\Gr_k(\mathcal{M})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:powers-nonzero-in-Gr}
Let $\Cc$ be a locally finite braided tensor category over some field. For all $X \in \Cc$, $X \neq 0$ and $m>0$ we have $[X]^m \neq 0$ in $\Gr(\Cc)$.
If in addition $\Cc$ is finite and if the field is of characteristic zero, then $\Cc$ satisfies Condition~P.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since by assumption all objects have finite length, we have
$\Gr(\Cc) = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} \Zb [U]$. Thus for $X \in \Cc$ it follows that  $X=0$ iff $[X]=0$. 

The map $\ev_X : X^* \otimes X \to \one$ is non-zero, hence $X^* \otimes X \neq 0$, and so $[X^*][X] \neq 0$. Iterating this argument shows $(X^* \otimes X)^* \otimes (X^* \otimes X) \neq 0$,
 i.e.\ $([X^*][X])^2 \neq 0$, etc. 
 We used here Drinfeld's canonical isomorphism $u_X: X \to X^{**}$ given by 
\be
u_X ~=
  \raisebox{-0.5\height}{\setlength{\unitlength}{.75pt}
  \begin{picture}(84,130)
   \put(0,0){\scalebox{.75}{\includegraphics{pics/drinfeld-element.pdf}}}
     \put(0,0){
     \put (2,0) {\scriptsize$ X $}
     \put (72,122) {\scriptsize$ X^{**} $}
     \put (2,85) {\scriptsize$ X^* $}
     \put (39,39) {\scriptsize$ X^* $}
     \put (37,85) {\scriptsize$ X $}
     }\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}
  \end{picture}}
  \quad .
\ee
Using commutativity of $\Gr(\Cc)$, after $m$ steps we find $[X^*]^m [X]^m \neq 0$.

As a finite
$\Cc$ has enough projectives, it contains a non-zero projective object $P$. Since in characteristic zero, the canonical ring homomorphism $\Gr(\Cc) \to \Gr_k(\Cc)$ is injective, $[P]^m \neq 0$ for all $m>0$ also holds in $\Gr_k(\Cc)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:condP-fin-char}
In positive characteristic, Condition~P may or may not be satisfied. For example, suppose that $k$ is of characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a finite group. If $p$ does not divide $|G|$, the category $k[G]$-mod of finite-dimensional $k[G]$-modules is semisimple and hence satisfies Condition~P by Lemma \ref{lem:ssi-sat-condP}.

On the other hand, if $G$ is a $p$-group the trivial $k[G]$-module is up to isomorphism the unique simple $k[G]$-module (see e.g.\ the corollary to Proposition 26 in Section 8.3 of \cite{Serre-book}). 
The projective cover of the trivial $k[G]$-module is $P := k[G]$ (see \cite[Sec.\,15.6]{Serre-book}).
The image of $P$ in $\Gr_k$ is $[P] = |G| \cdot [k] = 0$, as $p$ divides $|G|$. By the previous observations, every projective $k[G]$-module is isomorphic to a direct sum of $P$'s, and so $k[G]$-mod does not satisfy Condition~P.
\end{remark}

We can now state our first main result:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main-simpleproj}
Let $\Cc$ be a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over $k$.
If $\Cc$ satisfies Condition~P, it contains a simple projective object.
\end{theorem}

The proof relies on a series of lemmas and will be given at the end of this section. The idea is very simple: we show that in the absence of simple projectives, the injective algebra homomorphism $\smap$ from Corollary~\ref{cor:inj-alg-hom} would map the class $[P]$ of a projective object to a nilpotent natural endomorphism, 
	which is a contradiction to Condition~P.

\begin{remark}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item
Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} is a generalisation of a result by Cohen and Westreich \cite[Cor.\,3.6]{Cohen:2008}. There, the authors show that a factorisable ribbon Hopf algebra 
	$H$
over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero has an irreducible projective module. The proof strategy in \cite{Cohen:2008} is different from ours: in $\cite{Cohen:2008}$ it is observed that Hopf algebras with the above properties are also symmetric algebras (see Section~\ref{sec:traces} for the definition) and that fact is used to show existence of a simple projective
module.
 Our approach is in some sense opposite: we first show that there exists a simple projective module 
and then in Section~\ref{sec:traces} use the theory of
 modified traces of~\cite{Geer:2010}
 to deduce the existence of certain symmetric algebras.
In this sense, applying Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} to $\Cc = \Rep(H)$ gives an alternative proof of the result in \cite{Cohen:2008}
	(in addition to having the benefit of not being restricted to characteristic zero).
\item
In characteristic $p$, a category $\Cc$ as in Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} may or may not satisfy Condition~P.
To see this, we use the observations in Remark~\ref{rem:condP-fin-char}.
Let $A$ be a finite abelian group.
The Drinfeld double $D(k[A])$ is a factorisable Hopf algebra, and hence $D(k[A])$-mod is a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over $k$.
But as algebras, 
$D(k[A]) \cong k(A) \otimes_k k[A]$, and $k(A) = k^{|A|}$ is semisimple.

Suppose that $\mathrm{char}(k)=p$ does not divide $|A|$. Then $D(k[A])$-mod is semisimple and hence satisfies Condition~P (Lemma~\ref{lem:ssi-sat-condP}).

On the other hand, if $A$ is a $p$-group, the indecomposable projective modules in $D(k[A])$-mod are isomorphic to a simple $k(A)$-module tensored with $k[A]$. As in Remark~\ref{rem:condP-fin-char}, each of these have zero image in $\Gr_k(\Cc)$.

\item
The example in part 2 (combined with Remark~\ref{rem:condP-fin-char}) also shows that for $\mathrm{char}(k)=p$ and $A$ a finite abelian $p$-group, $D(k[A])$-mod does not contain a simple projective object. Thus we cannot drop Condition~P from Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

We now turn to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj}. We first gather the tools to see that $\sigma([P])$ is nilpotent for projective $P$ unless there is a simple projective object.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nat-endo-id_nilpot}
Let $\Ac$ be an abelian category and let $\eta$ be a natural 
	endomorphism
of the identity functor. If $\eta$ is zero on all simple objects, then it is nilpotent on all objects of finite length.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We use induction on the length of an object. Given an object $B$ of finite length $>1$, choose a short exact sequence $0 \to A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \to 0$ such that $A,C$ have smaller length. Then
\be
	\xymatrix{
	A \ar[r]^{f} \ar[d]^{\eta_A} & B  \ar[r]^{g} \ar[d]^{\eta_B} & C  \ar[d]^{\eta_C}
	\\
	A  \ar[r]^{f} & B  \ar[r]^{g} & C
	}
\ee
commutes. By induction hypothesis, $\eta_A$ and $\eta_C$ are nilpotent. Hence there is $m>0$ such that
\be
	\xymatrix{
	A \ar[r]^{f} \ar[d]^{0} & B  \ar[r]^{g} \ar[d]^{(\eta_B)^m} & C  \ar[d]^{0}
	\\
	A  \ar[r]^{f} & B  \ar[r]^{g} & C
	}
\ee
commutes. Then $g \circ (\eta_B)^m = 0$ and $(\eta_B)^m \circ f = 0$, 
and since the image of $f$ is the kernel of $g$
we have the inclusions $\mathrm{im} (\eta_B)^{m}\subset\mathrm{im} f \subset \mathrm{ker} (\eta_B)^{m}$. This shows that
$(\eta_B)^{2m}=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:nat-endo-id_nilpot}
Let $\Ac$ be a finite abelian category over some field and let $\eta \in \End(\Id_\Ac)$. If $\eta$ is zero on all simple objects, then $\eta$ is nilpotent, i.e.\ there is $m>0$ such that $\eta^m=0$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By finiteness, $\Ac$ contains a projective generator $G$ (of finite length). By Lemma~\ref{lem:nat-endo-id_nilpot}, $(\eta_G)^m=0$ for some $m$. Since $\eta_G$ determines $\eta$, it follows that $\eta^m=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:sigma-proj-zero-simple}
Let $\Cc$ be a pivotal finite braided tensor category over some field and let $P,U \in \Cc$ with $P$ projective and $U$ non-projective and simple. Then $\smap([P])_U=0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic},
$\smap([P])_U$ is a composition of maps $U \rightarrow P^* \otimes (U \otimes P) \rightarrow U$. 
Since $P^* \otimes (U \otimes P)$ is projective,  
the map $P^* \otimes (U \otimes P) \rightarrow U$ factors as
$P^* \otimes (U \otimes P) \rightarrow P_U \rightarrow U$, for $P_U$ the projective cover of $U$. Thus $\smap([P])_U$ can be written as a composition $U \rightarrow P_U \rightarrow U$. By assumption $P_U \ncong U$, and so this composition is zero.
\end{proof}

Combining the above results, the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} is now a straightforward consequence of Corollary~\ref{cor:inj-alg-hom}:

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj}]\footnote{
	We thank Victor Ostrik for suggesting a simplification of our first version of the proof.}
Suppose that $\Cc$ does not contain a simple projective object. 
By Condition~P, we can find a projective object $P \in \Cc$ such that $[P]^m \neq 0$ in $\Gr_k(\Cc)$ for all $m>0$.

By Corollary~\ref{cor:inj-alg-hom}, $\smap : \Gr_k(\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$ is an injective algebra homomorphism. 
In particular, since $[P]^m \neq 0$ we find that for each $m>0$,
$\smap([P])^m = \smap([P]^m) \neq 0$.
But by Lemma~\ref{lem:sigma-proj-zero-simple}, the natural transformation $\smap([P])$ is zero on all non-projective simples. By assumption, all simples in $\Cc$ are non-projective, and so Corollary~\ref{cor:nat-endo-id_nilpot} implies that $\smap([P])$ is nilpotent, which is a contradiction. 

Hence $\Cc$ must contain a simple projective object.
\end{proof}


\section{Non-degenerate trace on the projective ideal}\label{sec:traces}

In this section we will review some aspects of the theory of modified traces from \cite{Geer:2010,Geer:2011a,Geer:2011b}. In particular, we will see that the existence of a simple projective object
 established in Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} guarantees the existence of a unique-up-to-scalars non-zero modified trace on the projective ideal, and that this trace induces non-degenerate pairings on Hom-spaces. 

\medskip

Let $\Cc$ be a pivotal finite tensor category over
$k$.
The full subcategory $\Proj(\Cc)$ of all projective objects in $\Cc$ is a tensor ideal. Following \cite{Geer:2011a}, a {\em modified right trace} on $\Proj(\Cc)$ is a family of $k$-linear functions
$\{ t_P : \End(P) \to k \,|\, P \in \Proj(\Cc) \}$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\em (partial trace)} For all $P \in Proj(\Cc)$, $X \in \Cc$ and $f \in \End(P \ot X)$ we have
\be\label{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace}
	t_{P \ot X}(f)
	~=~ t_P(\, tr_X^r(f) \,)
\ee
where $tr_X^r$ denotes the partial right trace 
\begin{align}
	tr_X^r(f) &~:=~ 
	\big[\,
	P 
	\xrightarrow{\sim} P \one
	\xrightarrow{\id \ot \coev_X} P (X X^*)
	\xrightarrow{\sim} (PX)X^*
	\xrightarrow{f \ot \id} (P X) X^*
	\nonumber\\
	&\hspace{4em} \xrightarrow{\sim} P(XX^*)
	\xrightarrow{\id \ot \widetilde\ev_X} P\one
	\xrightarrow{\sim} P
	\,\big] 
\nonumber\\

  \qquad .
  \label{eq:partial-trace-def}
\end{align}
\item {\em (cyclicity)} For all $P,P' \in \Proj(\Cc)$, $f : P \to P'$, $g:  P' \to P$ we have
\be\label{eq:mod-tr_cyclic}
	t_{P'}(f \circ g) = t_P(g \circ f) \ .
\ee
\end{enumerate}

Given a modified right trace, one can define a family of pairings by setting, for all $M \in \Cc$, $P \in Proj(\Cc)$,
\be\label{eq:pairingMP}
	\Cc(M,P) \times \Cc(P,M) \to k
	\quad , \quad
	(f,g) \mapsto t_P(f \circ g) \ .
\ee
Note that the cyclicity property \eqref{eq:mod-tr_cyclic} only applies when also $M$ is projective.

\begin{remark}
There are also natural notions of left and left-right (or two-sided) modified traces for a pivotal category,
see~\cite{Geer:2011a} for details.
For $\Cc$ in addition ribbon, each modified right trace
on $\Proj(\Cc)$ is also a two-sided modified trace~\cite[Thm.\,3.3.1]{Geer:2010}.
In this case, one can construct  an isotopy invariant of
ribbon graphs in $\Rb^3$, where at least one strand is coloured by a projective object $P$ of $\Cc$, by cutting  the strand and computing $t_P$ of the corresponding endomorphism of $P$,
 see~\cite[Thm.\,3]{Geer:2009}. (There, the modified trace was used implicitly as the modified dimension for simple projectives.)
\end{remark}

In this paper we will only use modified right traces, and we will refer to these just as ``modified traces''.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:mtrace}
Let $\Cc$ be a unimodular pivotal finite tensor category over 
	$k$.
Suppose that $\Cc$ contains a simple projective object.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a nonzero modified trace on $\Proj(\Cc)$, and this modified trace is unique up to scalar multiples. 
\item For any choice of non-zero modified trace $t$ on $\Proj(\Cc)$ and for all $M \in \Cc$, $P \in Proj(\Cc)$, the pairing \eqref{eq:pairingMP} is non-degenerate.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

The first part of the proposition is proved in \cite[Cor.\,3.2.1]{Geer:2011b}\footnote{
In \cite[Sect.\,3.2]{Geer:2011b} it is assumed that every indecomposable object of $\Cc$ is absolutely indecomposable (see \cite{Geer:2011b} for definitions). This condition does typically not hold (e.g.\ in the example in Section~\ref{sec:sf-example}). However, the arguments in \cite[Sect.\,3.2]{Geer:2011b} actually only require this condition on $\Proj(\Cc)$, where it holds for any finite tensor category over an algebraically closed field.}.
We will review the argument below as we hope it to be helpful to have the more general construction of \cite{Geer:2011a,Geer:2011b} specialised to the present setting, and since
we will need the explicit construction of the
modified trace below anyway. The second part of the proposition is proved in \cite[Prop.\,6.6]{Costantino:2014sma} for the Hopf algebra $\overline U^H_q sl(2)$, but the same proof works in general as we also review below. 

Before turning to the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:mtrace}, we need some preparation. For the rest of this section, we fix:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Cc$: a unimodular pivotal finite tensor category over $k$,
\item $Q$: a simple projective object in $\Cc$
	(in particular we assume that such a $Q$ exists).
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Thm.\,3.1.3\,\&\,Sec.\,3.2]{Geer:2011b}}]\label{lem:simple-proj-ambi}
For all $g \in \End(Q \otimes Q^*)$ we have

     }\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}
  \end{picture}}
  \qquad .
\ee
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Write $Q \otimes Q^* = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} P_U^{\oplus m_U}$ and let $i_U : P_U^{\oplus m_U} \to Q \otimes Q^*$ and $p_U : Q \otimes Q^* \to P_U^{\oplus m_U}$ be the corresponding embedding and projection maps. The resulting idempotent will be denoted by $e_U = i_U \circ p_U \in \End(Q \otimes Q^*)$.
Since $\Cc(Q \otimes Q^*,\one)\cong \Cc(Q,Q)$
is one-dimensional ($Q$ being simple and 
$k$ algebraically closed), 
we have $m_\one = 1$.

Since $P_\one$ is indecomposable, there is an $\alpha \in k$ and a nilpotent element $n \in \End(P_\one)$ such that (using again algebraically closedness of $k$)\footnote{
	Since $P_\one$ is indecomposable, by Fitting's Lemma an element $x \in \End(P_\one)$ is either nilpotent or invertible. As $k$ is algebraically closed, 
$x - \alpha \cdot \id$  is not invertible for some  $\alpha \in k$  (as the $k$-linear map $x \circ (-)$ on $\End(P_\one)$ has an eigenvector), hence it is nilpotent, and therefore $x = \alpha \cdot \id + n$, as we state.}
\be\label{eq:simple-proj-ambi-aux1}
	p_\one \circ g \circ i_\one
	~=~ \alpha \cdot \id_{P_\one} + n \ .
\ee

For all $u : \one \to P_\one$ and $v : P_\one \to \one$ we have 
\be\label{eq:simple-proj-ambi-aux2}
n \circ u = 0 \qquad  \text{and} \qquad v \circ n=0 \ .
\ee
To see $n\circ u=0$, first note that by unimodularity (i.e.\ since $(P_\one)^* \cong P_\one$) $\Cc(\one,P_\one)$ is one-dimensional. Suppose $u \neq 0$ and 
hence $u$ forms a basis of $\Cc(\one,P_\one)$. Then there is $\lambda \in k$ such that 
$n \circ u = \lambda \cdot u$.
 But $n$ is nilpotent, say $n^m=0$,
and so applying $n$ on both sides of the latter equality
	$m$
times we get $\lambda^{m}=0$ and therefore 
 $\lambda=0$.  For $v$ the argument is analogous. 

Next insert the identity $g = \sum_{U,V} e_U \circ g \circ e_V$ into \eqref{eq:simple-proj-ambi}. Since for $U \ncong \one$, $\Cc(P_U,\one)=0$ and $\Cc(\one,P_U)=0$ (using unimodularity),
 only the term with $U=V=\one$
will contribute on either side of \eqref{eq:simple-proj-ambi}.

The claim of the lemma now follows from the observation that
taking $u=p_\one\circ \coev_Q$ and $v=\widetilde\ev_Q \circ i_\one$ we have
 by \eqref{eq:simple-proj-ambi-aux1} and \eqref{eq:simple-proj-ambi-aux2}
\be
	\widetilde\ev_Q \circ e_\one \circ g \circ e_\one
	= \alpha \cdot \widetilde\ev_Q
	\quad , \quad
	e_\one \circ g \circ e_\one \circ \coev_Q
	= \alpha \cdot \coev_Q \ ,
\ee
where we used that $\widetilde\ev_Q \circ e_\one = \widetilde\ev_Q$ and $e_\one \circ \coev_Q = \coev_Q$ (because $(P_\one)^*\cong P_\one$). 
	Both  the left and right hand sides of~\eqref{eq:simple-proj-ambi} are therefore equal to $\alpha\,\id_Q$.
\end{proof}

The above lemma will be used in the following form: for all $f \in \End(Q^* \otimes Q)$,

Let us fix a non-zero linear function
for the given simple projective $Q$,
\be\label{eq:tQ-choice}
	t_Q ~:~ \End(Q) \to k \ .
\ee
Since $\End(Q) = k \, \id_Q$, such a function is unique up to a constant, and it is uniquely determined by its value $t_Q( \id_Q ) \in k^\times$.

Let $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$ and choose an object $X \in \Cc$ such that there is a surjection $p : Q \otimes X \to P$. Such an $X$ always exists, for example $X = Q^* \otimes P$. As $P$ is projective, there is a morphism $i : P \to Q \otimes X$ such that $p \circ i = \id_P$. That is, $i,p$ realise $P$ as a direct summand of $Q \otimes X$. Consider the function
\be\label{eq:tP-defn}
	t_P : \End(P) \to k
	\quad , \quad
	h \mapsto t_Q\big(\, tr^r_X(i \circ h \circ p) \,\big) \ .
\ee
The next lemma shows 
	in particular
that this notation is indeed consistent with \eqref{eq:tQ-choice} when setting $P=Q$ (in the lemma, take $X=\one$ and $i,p$ (inverse) unit isomorphisms).


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tr-indep-choice}
The function $t_P$ in \eqref{eq:tP-defn} is independent of the choice of $X$ and of $p : Q \otimes X \to P$, $i : P \to Q \otimes X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This proof is taken from {\cite[Sec.\,4.5]{Geer:2011a}}. The argument is more general than needed for the statement of the lemma, but we can reuse it later to show cyclicity.

Let $P' \in \Proj(\Cc)$ and pick $X'$, $p' : Q \otimes X' \to P'$, 
$i' : P' \to Q \otimes X'$. For $u : P \to P'$ and $v : P' \to P$
	arbitrary,
consider the morphism $f \in \End(Q^* \otimes Q)$ given by
\be

\ee
It is easy to check that inserting $f$ into \eqref{eq:simple-proj-leftright} results in the identity
\be\label{eq:tr-tr}
	tr^r_{X'}(i'\circ u \circ v \circ p')
	=
	tr^r_{X}(i\circ v \circ u \circ p) \ ,
\ee
where for RHS we used 
cyclicity of the categorical trace, the zig-zag axiom and that $p'\circ i'= \id_{P'}$.
For $P=P'$ and 	$u=h$, $v=\id_P$, 
this shows the statement of the lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:mtrace}]~ 

\smallskip

\noindent
{\em Part 1.} (following \cite[Sec.\,4.5]{Geer:2011a})

\smallskip

\noindent
{\em Existence:} By Lemma~\ref{lem:tr-indep-choice} we have a family of functions $\big(t_P : \End(P) \to k\big)_{P \in \Proj(\Cc)}$. 
This family is not identically zero since by the definition in \eqref{eq:tQ-choice}, $t_Q$ is not zero.
	By \eqref{eq:tr-tr} in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:tr-indep-choice},
the $t_P$ satisfy the cyclicity requirement~\eqref{eq:mod-tr_cyclic}.

For the partial trace property \eqref{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace} choose $Y \in \Cc$ such that there are $p : Q \otimes Y \to P$, $i : P \to Q \otimes Y$, $p \circ i =\id_P$, in order to compute $t_P$ from the definition in \eqref{eq:tP-defn}
	with $X$ replaced by $Y$. 
Then fix 
\be
	p' = \big[ \, Q  (Y  X) \xrightarrow{\sim} (Q  Y)  X \xrightarrow{ p \otimes \id_X} P X \, \big] \quad , \quad
	i' = \big[ \,  P X \xrightarrow{ i \otimes \id_X} (Q  Y)  X \xrightarrow{\sim} Q  (Y  X)  \, \big]
\ee
to compute $t_{P \otimes X}$ from \eqref{eq:tP-defn}. A short calculation shows  \eqref{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace}.

\smallskip

\noindent
{\em Uniqueness:} First note that for the modified trace $t_P$ in \eqref{eq:tP-defn}
	(or in fact for any modified trace)
 we have, for $f \in \End(Q \otimes X)$,
\be\label{eq:mtrace-aux1}
	tr^r_X(f) = \frac{t_{Q \otimes X}(f)}{t_Q(\id_Q)} \cdot \id_Q \ .
\ee
To see this, apply $t_Q$ to both sides.
Let now $\big(t_P' : \End(P) \to k\big)_{P \in \Proj(\Cc)}$ be a modified trace. 
	Let $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$ and $h \in \End(P)$ be given. Pick $X$, $p : Q \otimes X \to P$, $i : P \to Q \otimes X$ such that $p \circ i=\id_P$ and compute
\begin{align}
t'_P(h)
&~=~
t'_P(h \circ p \circ i)
\overset{\text{cycl.}}=
t'_{Q \otimes X}(i \circ h \circ p)
\overset{\text{part.tr.}}=
t'_{Q}( tr^r_X(i \circ h \circ p))
\nonumber\\ &
\overset{\text{\eqref{eq:mtrace-aux1}}}=
\frac{t_{Q \otimes X}(i \circ h \circ p)}{t_Q(\id_Q)} \cdot t'_{Q}(\id_Q)
\overset{\text{cycl.}}=
\frac{t'_{Q}(\id_Q)}{t_Q(\id_Q)} \cdot t_P(h) \ .
\end{align}

\noindent
{\em Part 2.} 
(following the proof of \cite[Prop.\,6.6]{Costantino:2014sma})

\smallskip

\noindent
	We will show non-degeneracy in the first argument of the pairing \eqref{eq:pairingMP}. Non-degeneracy in the second argument can be seen analogously. 
	
Let $M \in \Cc$, $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$ and $f \in \Cc(M,P)$, $f \neq 0$, 
be given. We need to show that there is a $g \in \Cc(P,M)$ such that $t_P(f \circ g) \neq 0$.
Pick $X$, $p : Q \otimes X \to P$, $i : P \to Q \otimes X$ such that $p \circ i=\id_P$. 
Then also $i \circ f \neq 0$. Define 
\be
	u ~:=~ \big[ \, 
	MX^* 
	\xrightarrow{(i \circ f) \otimes \id} (QX)X^* \xrightarrow{\sim} Q(XX^*)
	\xrightarrow{\id \otimes \widetilde\ev_X}  Q\one \xrightarrow{\sim}  Q 
	\,\big]  \ .
\ee
Using the zig-zag identity,
we can recover $i \circ f$ from $u$ as
\be
	i \circ f ~=~ \big[ \, M \xrightarrow{\sim} M \one
	\xrightarrow{\id \otimes \widetilde\coev_X} M(X^*X) \xrightarrow{\sim} 
	(M X^*)X
	\xrightarrow{u\otimes \id_X}  QX  
	\,\big]  \ .
\ee
In particular, since $i \circ f \neq 0$, we must have $u \neq 0$.
Since $Q$ is simple, $u$ is surjective. Since $Q$ is projective, there is $v : Q \to M \otimes X^*$ such that $u \circ v = \id_Q$. Define
\be
	g ~:=~ \big[ \, P 
	\xrightarrow{i} QX
	\xrightarrow{v \otimes \id} (MX^*)X
	\xrightarrow{\sim} M(X^*X)
	\xrightarrow{\id \otimes \ev_X}  M\one \xrightarrow{\sim} M 
	\,\big] \ .
\ee
Then
\begin{align}
t_P(f \circ g) 
&\overset{\text{part.tr.}}=

Step (*) follows from cyclicity of the modified trace, as well as naturality of the braiding. In step (**)
 we  used that the partial trace over $S\otimes R^*$ amounts to closing the double string, see \eqref{eq:partial-trace-def}. 
 In the last equality,
 to straighten the line coloured by $R$ we also used~\eqref{eq:ev-coev-tilde} and the property of the pivotal structure that $\delta^*_R = (\delta_{R^*})^{-1}$.

\begin{remark}\label{rem:modified-trace-consequences}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item
The result of Proposition~\ref{prop:mtrace} is remarkable, because the categorical trace defined on all of $\Cc$ via the pivotal structure vanishes on $\Proj(\Cc)$ unless $\Cc$ is semisimple. Indeed, 
$\Cc$ is semisimple iff  $P_\one = \one$,
 which in turn is equivalent to the existence of $f,g$ such that $\one \xrightarrow{f} P_\one \xrightarrow{g} \one$ is non-zero. But for any projective object $P$, the categorical trace
\be
\one \xrightarrow{\coev_P} P \ot P^* \xrightarrow{f \ot \id} P \ot P^* \xrightarrow{\widetilde\ev_P} \one \ ,
\ee 
factors through $P_\one$ 
	in this way. 
\item
For each $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$, $t_P$ turns the $k$-algebra $\End(P)$ into a symmetric Frobenius algebra, or a symmetric algebra for short. We will review some aspects of symmetric algebras and their categories of modules in Section~\ref{sec:sym-alg-ideal}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Since a factorisable finite tensor category is automatically unimodular \cite[Prop.\,4.5]{Etingof:2004}, 
	we state the following consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj} and Proposition~\ref{prop:mtrace} for later use:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:factorisable-implies-trace}
A factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category $\Cc$ 
over $k$ which satisfies Condition~P
admits an up-to-scalar unique modified trace on $\Proj(\Cc)$. For each non-zero modified trace, the pairings \eqref{eq:pairingMP} are non-degenerate.
\end{corollary}

This result generalises the existence of a modified trace for factorisable Hopf algebras (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) proven in~\cite[Thm.\,4.3.1]{Geer:2011b}.

\begin{remark}
The converse of Corollary~\ref{cor:factorisable-implies-trace} does not hold, i.e.\ it is not true that a pivotal finite tensor category $\Cc$ over $k$ which satisfies Condition~P and admits a non-zero modified trace on $\Proj(\Cc)$ can be equipped with a braiding that makes it factorisable. The simplest example is the category of super-vector spaces, which only admits symmetric
braidings. A non-semisimple example is provided by the restricted quantum group $\overline{U}_q sl(2)$.  
This is a unimodular Hopf algebra which has a simple projective module but whose category of  modules does not admit a braiding~\cite{[FGST],KS,Gainutdinov:2015lja}.
\end{remark}


\section{Symmetric algebras and ideals in $\boldsymbol{\End(\Id_\Cc)}$}\label{sec:sym-alg-ideal}

In this section we will collect some facts about symmetric algebras following \cite{Broue:2009,Cohen:2008} and translate them into categorical statements. In the end we give implications for categories with modified trace as in the previous section.

\medskip

For a $k$-algebra $A$, denote by
\be
	C(A) ~=~ \big\{ \,\varphi : A \to k \,\big|\, \varphi(ab) = \varphi(ba) \text{ for all }a,b \in A \,\big\} 
\ee
the space of {\em central forms} on $A$. 
A {\em symmetric algebra} $A$ over $k$ (aka a {\em symmetric Frobenius algebra}) is a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra together with a central form $\eps$ such that the induced pairing $(a,b) \mapsto \eps(ab)$ is non-degenerate. In this case the map
\be\label{eq:zeta:ZA-CA}
	\zeta : Z(A) \to C(A) \quad , \quad z \mapsto \eps(z \cdot (-))
\ee
is an isomorphism, and the invertible elements of $Z(A)$ are precisely mapped to those elements of $C(A)$ that induce a non-degenerate pairing (see e.g.\ \cite[Lem.\,2.5]{Broue:2009}).


\newcommand{\cop}{\gamma}
Let $(A,\eps)$ be a symmetric algebra and denote by 
$\cop \in A \otimes A$, $\cop = \sum_{(\cop)} \cop' \otimes \cop''$, 
the copairing, that is, for all $a \in A$ we have
 $a = \sum_{(\cop)} \eps(a \cop')\cop''
 = \sum_{(\cop)}  \cop'\eps(\cop''a)$.
	We recall that the copairing is unique and that, since $\eps$ is central, the copairing is symmetric.
Define the map
\be\label{eq:tau-map-A-ZA-def}
	\tau : A \to Z(A)
	\quad , \quad
	a \mapsto \sum_{(\cop)} \cop' a \cop'' \ .
\ee
It is easy to check that the image of $\tau$ does indeed lie in the centre of $A$ (see e.g.\ \cite[Sec.\,3.A]{Broue:2009}). 
The argument uses that the copairing $\cop$ of a non-degenerate 
invariant 
pairing satisfies $\sum_{(\cop)}(a\cop')\otimes \cop'' = \sum_{(\cop)}\cop'\otimes (\cop'' a)$ for all $a\in A$.

We will need the following chains of inclusions in $C(A)$ and $Z(A)$, compatible with the map $\zeta$ from \eqref{eq:zeta:ZA-CA} \cite{Cohen:2008}:
\be\label{eq:ZA-CA-subsets}
\xymatrix{
Z(A)\ar[d]_\zeta & \supset & \Rey(A) \ar[d]_\zeta & \supset& \Hig(A) \ar[d]_\zeta 
\\
C(A) & \supset & R(A) & \supset& I(A)
}
\ee
The individual subsets are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\Rey(A) = \mathrm{ann}_{Z(A)}(\Jac(A))$ is the {\em Reynolds ideal}. (Symmetry of $A$ is not required for this definition.) Here, $\Jac(A)$ is the Jacobson radical of $A$. $\Rey(A)$ is an ideal in~$Z(A)$.
\item
$\Hig(A) = \mathrm{im}(\tau)$
 is the {\em Higman ideal} or {\em projective centre}\footnote{
The name ``projective centre'' can be motivated from the observation that $\Hig(A)$ can be described as all elements in $Z(A)$ such that the corresponding endomorphism of the $A$-$A$-bimodule $A$ factors through a projective 
$A$-$A$-bimodule
\cite[Prop.\,2.3\,\&\,2.4]{Liu:2012}. 
}.
It is an ideal in $Z(A)$ as $z\tau(a) = \tau(za)$ for $z\in Z(A)$, and by \cite[Lem.\,4.1]{Hethelyi:2005}\footnote{
In \cite[Sec.\,4]{Hethelyi:2005} the underlying field is assumed to be algebraically closed, but this is not used in the proof of Lemma 4.1
in \cite{Hethelyi:2005}.}
it is contained in $\Rey(A)$.
Note that even though $\tau$ depends on the choice of
	a
non-degenerate central form $\varepsilon$, $\mathrm{im}(\tau)$ does not. Indeed, any two $\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon'$ would be related by an invertible $z \in Z(A)$ as $\varepsilon'(a) = \varepsilon(za)$, and one checks that $\tau'(a) = \tau(z^{-1}a)$.
\item
$R(A) = \mathrm{span}_k\{ \,\chi_M \,|\, M \text{ right $A$-module} \}$, where $\chi_M(a) = \mathrm{tr}_M(a)$, the trace in $M$ over the linear map given by acting with $a\in A$. That $\zeta(\Rey(A))=R(A)$ is shown in \cite[Thm.\,1.6]{Lorenz:1997} (for finite-dimensional not necessarily symmetric algebras).
\item
$I(A) = \mathrm{span}_k\{\, \chi_P \,|\, P \text{ projective right $A$-module} \}$. In \cite[Prop.\,2.1]{Cohen:2008}
it is shown that $\zeta(\Hig(A))=I(A)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:ZA=ReyA}
For an algebra $A$ over some field, $Z(A)=\Rey(A)$ if and only if $A$ is semisimple.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $A$ is semisimple, $\Jac(A)=0$ and hence $Z(A) = \Rey(A)$. 
Conversely, if
$Z(A) = \Rey(A)$ then $1 \in \Rey(A)$ and since $\Jac(A)$ annihilates $\Rey(A)$ we must have $\Jac(A)=0$.
\end{proof}

The {\em Cartan matrix} of a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ over some field 
is the 
$\Irr(\rmod{A}) \times \Irr(\rmod{A})$ 
 matrix $\CM(A)$  with entries
\be
	\CM(A)_{U,V} ~=~ [P_U:V] \ ,
\ee
that is, the multiplicity of the simple $A$-module $V$ in the composition series of the projective cover $P_U$ of $U$.

Let $e_U$, $U \in \Irr(\rmod{A})$ be a choice of primitive idempotents such that $e_UA \cong P_U$ as right $A$-modules. If
  the underlying field is given by $k$, which we assumed to be algebraically closed in the outset of the paper,
the endomorphism spaces of simple $A$-modules are one-dimensional and we can write
\be
	\CM(A)_{U,V} ~=~ \dim_k \Hom_A(P_V,P_U) ~=~ \dim_k( \, e_U A e_V \, )  \ .
\ee
The last equality follows by noting that every right $A$-module map $f : e_VA \to e_UA$ is given by left multiplication with an element $e_U a e_V$, $a \in A$.
	Namely,
in one direction we set $f\mapsto f(e_V)e_V\in e_UA e_V$, 
while  in the other direction  $e_U a e_V \mapsto e_U a e_V \cdot (-)$ which is  in $\Hom_A(e_VA,e_UA)$, and one checks that both the maps are inverses of each other.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:cartan-sym+rank}
Let $A$ be a symmetric algebra over 
	$k$.
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Cartan matrix of $A$ is symmetric, 
$\CM(A)_{U,V} = \CM(A)_{V,U}$.
\item Let $n = |\Irr(\rmod{A})|$ and 
let 
$\widehat\CM \in \mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$ 
be the image of $\CM(A)$ under the canonical homomorphism $\mathrm{Mat}_n(\Zb) \to \mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$. We have
\be
	\mathrm{rank}\big(\widehat\CM \big) 
	~=~ \dim_k \Hig(A) \ .
\ee
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

	\begin{proof}
For part 1 one checks that the non-degenerate pairing on $A$ descends to a non-degenerate pairing between $e_UAe_V$ and $e_VAe_U$.
	Indeed, for every $a\in A$ such that $e_Uae_V \neq 0$ there exists $b\in A$ such that $(e_Uae_V, b) \neq 0$. But then also $(e_Uae_V, e_Vbe_U) \neq 0$ since $\eps(e_U ae_V  b ) = \eps(e_U e_Uae_V e_V b ) = \eps(e_Uae_V e_V b e_U)$. 
Hence, $\dim_k(e_U A e_V)=\dim_k(e_V A e_U)$.
The more surprising part 2 is proved in \cite[Cor.\,2.7]{Liu:2012}. 
	\end{proof}
	
Note that if $k$ has 
characteristic~$0$, then $\mathrm{rank}(\tilde \CM)$ is just the
  rank of $\CM(A)$ over~$\mathbb{Q}$.

\medskip

We now give a categorical formulation of the inclusions $Z(A) \supset \Rey(A) \supset \Hig(A)$ in \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets}, which will be applicable in particular in the presence of a modified trace as in Section~\ref{sec:traces}. For the rest of this section, let us fix
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Ac$: a finite abelian category over 
	$k$,
\item $G$: a projective generator of $\Ac$,
\item $E = \End(G)$ the $k$-algebra of endomorphisms of $G$.
\end{itemize}

Recall the Hom-tensor adjoint equivalence 
\be\label{eq:C-modE-equiv}
\xymatrix@C=60pt@W=5pt@M=5pt{
\Ac \ar@/^/[r]^{\Ac(G,-)}
&\rmod{E} \ar@/^/[l]^{- \otimes_E G}
}
\ee
of $k$-linear
categories
between $\Ac$ and the category $\rmod{E}$ of finite-dimensional right $E$-modules  (see e.g.\ \cite[Sect.\,1.8]{EGNO-book}).

It is known that being symmetric is a Morita-invariant property of an algebra, as is the chain of ideals $Z(E) \supset \Rey(E) \supset \Hig(E)$ (see e.g.\ \cite{Hethelyi:2005,Broue:2009,Liu:2012} for related results). We can therefore use the equivalence in \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} and the ideals in \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets}
for the choice $A=E$ and for a given projective generator $G$
 to define a chain of ideals in $\End(\Id_\Ac)$ as:
\be\label{eq:End-Rey-Hig}
\xymatrix@C=10pt@R=20pt@W=4pt@M=4pt{
\End(\Id_\Ac)\ar^{\cong}[d] & \supset & \Rey(\Ac) \ar^{\cong}[d] & \supset& \Hig(\Ac) \ar^{\cong}[d] 
\\
Z(E) &  & \Rey(E) & & \Hig(E)
}
\ee
Rather than showing directly that the above definition is independent of the choice of $G$, we will now give a different definition of $\Rey(\Ac)$ and $\Hig(\Ac)$ which does not require a choice of a projective generator. We show in Propositions~\ref{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)} and \ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod} that this definition agrees with the one above.


\subsubsection*{$\boldsymbol{\Rey(\Ac)}$} 

For each $P \in \Proj(\Ac)$ define the subspace $J_P \subset \End(P)$ as follows:
\be\label{eq:JP-def}
	J_P ~=~ \big\{ \, f : P \to P \,\big|\,
	\forall \, U \in \Ac \text{ simple},\, u \in \Ac(P,U) :
	u \circ f = 0 \, \big\} \ .
\ee
By definition, the Jacobson radical $\Jac(R)$ of a ring $R$ consists of all $r \in R$ which act as zero on all simple $R$-modules. 
Since  $G \in \Ac$ is a projective generator, $\Ac(G,U)$, where $U$ runs over all simple $U \in \Ac$, gives all simple right $E$-modules up to isomorphism (by the equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}). {}From~\eqref{eq:JP-def} we therefore get
\be\label{eq:JG-Jac}
	J_G ~=~ \Jac(E) \ .
\ee
In the case $\Ac = \rmod{A}$ we can take $G = A_A$, so that $\End(G)=A$ and hence $J_A = \Jac(A)$.

Using the subspaces \eqref{eq:JP-def}, we define
\be
	\Rey(\Ac) ~=~ \big\{ \, \eta \in \End(\Id_\Ac)  \,\big|\,
	\forall\, P \in \Proj(\Ac), f \in J_P : 
	\eta_P \circ f = 0 \, \big\} \ .
\ee
{}From this definition it is immediate that $\Rey(\Ac)$ is an ideal.

Recall that for a projective generator $G \in \Ac$,
the map
\be\label{eq:EndId-ZE-iso}
	\xi : \End(\Id_\Ac) \to Z(E) \quad , \quad \eta \mapsto \eta_G
\ee
is an algebra isomorphism
(that $\eta_G$ is central in $E$ follows from the naturality of $\eta$;	that \eqref{eq:EndId-ZE-iso} is a bijection is clear in the case $\Ac = \rmod{E}$,
	for general $\Ac$ use the equivalence~\eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}). We can use this to relate $\Rey(\Ac)$ to the previous definition in terms of algebras:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)}
Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. Then $\xi$ in \eqref{eq:EndId-ZE-iso} restricts to an isomorphism of algebras $\xi : \Rey(\rmod{A}) \to \Rey(A)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We set $\Ac=\rmod{A}$ and choose the projective generator $G=A_A$ and thus $E=A$.
We have to show that
$\xi(\Rey(\Ac)) = \Rey(E)$.

\smallskip

\noindent
``$\subset$'':
Let $\eta \in \Rey(\Ac)$. Then $\xi(\eta) = \eta_G$. By definition of $\Rey(\Ac)$ we have in particular that for all $f \in J_G
=\Jac(E)$ (recall~\eqref{eq:JG-Jac}), 
$\eta_G \circ f=0$.
 Thus $\eta_G$ annihilates $\Jac(E)$,
  i.e.\ $\eta_G \in \Rey(E)$.

\smallskip

\noindent
``$\supset$'': Conversely, let $r \in \Rey(E)$ and let $\eta = \xi^{-1}(r) \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$. 
Let $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$, and $f \in J_P$. We need to show $\eta_P \circ f = 0$.
Pick a surjection $p : G^{\oplus n} \to P$ and a right-inverse $i : P \to G^{\oplus n}$. 
	We have $i \circ f \circ p \in J_{G^{\oplus n}}$ since for all $u : G^{\oplus n} \to U$, where $U$ is simple,
 $u \circ i \circ f \circ p = 0$ since $u \circ i : P \to U$ and $f \in J_P$.
Note then that $r^{\oplus n}: G^{\oplus n} \to G^{\oplus n}$ and $r^{\oplus n}\in \Rey(\End(G^{\oplus n}))$, therefore
$r^{\oplus n} \circ i \circ f \circ p = 0$. Since $r^{\oplus n} = \eta_{G^{\oplus n}}$ we get
\be
	0 =  \eta_{G^{\oplus n}} \circ i \circ f \circ p
	  = i \circ \eta_P \circ f \circ p \ .
\ee
But $i$ is injective and $p$ surjective, and so $\eta_P \circ f = 0$, as required.
\end{proof}


\subsubsection*{$\boldsymbol{\Hig(\Ac)}$} 

The condition replacing that the algebra is symmetric will be that $\Proj(\Ac)$ is Calabi-Yau (see e.g.\ \cite{Hesse:2016} for a recent treatment of the relation between symmetric Frobenius algebras and Calabi-Yau categories in the semisimple case):

\newcommand{\tCY}{\mathsf{t}}
\begin{definition}\label{def:CY-cat}
A $k$-linear additive category $\mathcal{K}$ with finite-dimensional Hom-spaces is called {\em Calabi-Yau} if it is equipped with a family of $k$-linear maps (the {\em trace maps})
\be
	\big(\,\tCY_M : \End(M) \to k \,\big)_{M \in \mathcal{K}}
\ee
such that for all $M,N \in \mathcal{K}$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item {(\em cyclicity)} for all $f: M\to N$, $g:N \to M$ we have $\tCY_M(g \circ f) = \tCY_N(f \circ g)$.
\item {(\em non-degeneracy)} the pairing $(-,-) : 
\mathcal{K}(M,N) \times \mathcal{K}(N,M) 
\to k$, $(f,g) = \tCY_N(f \circ g)$ is non-degenerate.
\end{enumerate}
We denote by $\mathrm{CY}(\mathcal{K})$ the set of all families of trace maps $(\tCY_M)_{M \in \mathcal{K}}$ which turn $\mathcal{K}$ into a Calabi-Yau category.
\end{definition}

 
A Calabi-Yau category with one object is the same as a symmetric Frobenius algebra. The  generalisation of the isomorphism \eqref{eq:zeta:ZA-CA} to the present setting is:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:CY-traces_torsor_EndId*}
Let $\mathcal{K}$ be as in Definition~\ref{def:CY-cat} 
and let $\End(\Id_{\mathcal{K}})^\times$ be the subset of invertible endo-transformations. Then for each $(\tCY_M)_{M \in \mathcal{K}} \in \mathrm{CY}(\mathcal{K})$ 
the map
\be
	\End(\Id_{\mathcal{K}})^\times
	\longrightarrow \mathrm{CY}(\mathcal{K})
	\quad , \quad
	\eta  ~\longmapsto~ \big( f \mapsto \tCY_M(\eta_M \circ f) \big) 
\ee
is a bijection.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Clearly, $(\tCY_M(\eta_M \circ -))_{M \in \mathcal{K}}$ defines a family of cyclic and non-degenerate traces 
(for non-degeneracy, one notes that $\eta_M \circ g$ is non-zero for any non-zero $g$ because $\eta_M$ is invertible). 
Conversely, given 
	$(\tilde\tCY_M)_{M \in \mathcal{K}} \in \mathrm{CY}(\mathcal{K})$, 
by non-degeneracy for each $M \in \mathcal{K}$ there exists a unique $\eta_M \in \End(M)^\times$ such that
 $\tilde\tCY_M(-) = \tCY_M(\eta_M \circ -)$. 
Rewriting the cyclicity condition $\tilde\tCY_M(g \circ f) = \tilde\tCY_N(f \circ g)$ for all $f : M\to N$ and $g:N\to M$ in terms of 
the family $\tCY_M$
and using its cyclicity property shows $\tCY_M\bigl(g\circ (\eta_N \circ f - f \circ \eta_M)\bigr) = 0$ for any $g$,
and thus by non-degeneracy of $\tCY_M$ we have  $\eta_N \circ f = f \circ \eta_M$ for all $M$, $N$, and $f$.
\end{proof}

Suppose now that the finite abelian category $\Ac$ is such that $\Proj(\Ac)$ is Calabi-Yau with trace maps $(\tCY_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$. For the pairings of morphisms between the projective objects $P,R \in \Proj(\Ac)$ we write
\be\label{eq:paring-projective}
	(-,-)_{PR} : \Ac(P,R) \times \Ac(R,P) \to k
	\quad , \quad
	(f,g)_{PR} = \tCY_{R}(f \circ g) \ .
\ee
Denote by $\gamma_{PR} \in \Ac(R,P) \otimes \Ac(P,R)$ the corresponding 
(unique) copairing, that is $\gamma_{PR} = \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \otimes \gamma_{PR}''$ and for all $x : P \to R$, $y : R \to P$, 
\be\label{eq:coparing-gamma-properties}
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \big(\,x\,,\,\gamma_{PR}'\,\big)_{\!PR} \,\, \gamma_{PR}'' ~=~ x
	\qquad , \qquad
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \,\, \big(\,\gamma_{PR}''\,,\,y\,\big)_{\!PR} ~=~ y
	\ .
\ee
We need the following lemma, whose proof is given in Appendix~\ref{app:ReyHigideal}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tau-R-welldef}
For each $R \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and $y \in \End(R)$ there exists a unique $\eta \in \End(\Id_\Ac)$ such that $\eta_{P} = \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \circ y \circ \gamma_{PR}''$ for all $P \in \Proj(\Ac)$.
\end{lemma}

This lemma allows us to define, for each $R \in \Proj(\Ac)$,  a $k$-linear map $\tau_R : \End(R) \to \End(\Id_\Ac)$ by
\be\label{eq:tau_R-defn}
	\tau_R(y) = \eta
	\quad , \quad
	\text{where for all $P \in \Proj(\Ac)$} \quad
	\eta_P = \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \circ y \circ \gamma_{PR}''
	\ .
\ee
These maps are the analogue of the map $\tau$ from \eqref{eq:tau-map-A-ZA-def}. Indeed, $\Hig(\Ac)$ is now defined as the joint image of all the maps $\tau_R$:
\begin{align}\label{eq:HA-def-2}
	\Hig(\Ac) = \big\{\, \eta \in \End(\Id_\Ac) \,\big|\,
	&\exists\, R \in \Proj(\Ac)\,,\, y \in \End(R) \,:\, \eta = \tau_R(y) \,\big\} \ .
\end{align}
The point of the above definition is to avoid the choice of a projective generator. 
To actually compute $\Hig(\Ac)$, choosing a projective generator $G$ may nonetheless be useful.
For example, we show in Corollary~\ref{cor:HigA-from-projgen} that $\Hig(\Ac) = \mathrm{im}(\tau_G)$.

As was the case for the Higman ideal of a symmetric algebra, also $\Hig(\Ac)$ is independent of the choice of traces:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:HigA-indep-tr}
Let $\Ac$ be a finite abelian category over $k$ such that $\Proj(\Ac)$ is Calabi-Yau. Then $\Hig(\Ac)$ is independent of the choice of the family of traces $(\tCY_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\tCY, \tilde\tCY \in \mathrm{CY}(\Proj(\Ac))$. By Lemma~\ref{lem:CY-traces_torsor_EndId*} there is $\eta \in \End(\Id_{\Proj(\Ac)})^\times$ such that $\tilde\tCY_P(f) = \tCY_P(\eta_P \circ f)$ for all $P \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and $f \in \End(P)$.
Let $\gamma_{PR}$ and $\tilde\gamma_{PR}$ be the copairings arising from $\tCY$ and $\tilde\tCY$ as in \eqref{eq:coparing-gamma-properties}. If we write $\gamma_{PR} = \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \otimes \gamma_{PR}''$, it is easy to see that
\be\label{eq:HigA-indep-tr_aux1}
	\tilde\gamma_{PR} 
	~=~ \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} (\gamma_{PR}' \circ \eta_R^{-1})
	 \otimes \gamma_{PR}''
	~=~ \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \otimes (\eta_R^{-1} \circ \gamma_{PR}'') \ .
\ee
Write $\tilde\tau_R$ for the map \eqref{eq:tau_R-defn} computed from $\tilde\gamma$. It is immediate from the above equality that for $y \in \End(R)$,
\be
	\tilde\tau_R(y) = \tau_R(\eta_R^{-1} \circ y) \ .
\ee
Thus indeed the joint image of the $\tau_R$ is independent of the choice of traces $\tCY_P$.
\end{proof}


The next proposition makes the connection between the definition \eqref{eq:HA-def-2} of $\Hig(\Ac)$ 
and $\Hig(A)$ for a symmetric algebra $A$ when taking $\Ac = \rmod{A}$. The proof has been relegated to Appendix~\ref{app:ReyHigideal}.


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:HigA-HigAmod}
Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ admits a central form turning it into a symmetric algebra if and only if $\Proj(\rmod{A})$ admits a family of traces turning it into a Calabi-Yau category.
\item
If $A$ is symmetric, the map $\xi$ from \eqref{eq:EndId-ZE-iso} 
for $G=A_A$
restricts to an isomorphism of algebras $\xi : \Hig(\rmod{A}) \to \Hig(A)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

Combining this proposition 
and Proposition~\ref{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)}
with the equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} and the inclusions \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets} we get that we indeed have the inclusions \eqref{eq:End-Rey-Hig}.

\medskip

As for algebras, the Cartan matrix of $\Ac$ is the $\Irr(\Ac){\times}\Irr(\Ac)$-matrix $\CM(\Ac)$ with entries $\CM(\Ac)_{UV} = [P_U:V]$, i.e.\ in the Grothendieck group $\Gr(\Ac)$ we have
\be\label{eq:composition-series-proj-cover}
  [P_U] ~= \sum_{V \in \Irr(\Ac)} \!\! \CM(\Ac)_{UV} \, [V] \ .
\ee
	Since $k$ is algebraically closed, we can write
\be\label{eq:cartan-mat-def}
	\CM(\Ac)_{UV} ~=~ \dim_k \Ac(P_V,P_U) \ .
\ee
In view of Proposition~\ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod}
 and the equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv},
  we have the following corollary to Proposition~\ref{prop:cartan-sym+rank}.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general}
Let $\Ac$ be a finite abelian category over
$k$ such that $\Proj(\Ac)$ is Calabi-Yau. 
Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Cartan matrix of $\Ac$ is symmetric, 
$\CM(\Ac)_{U,V} = \CM(\Ac)_{V,U}$.
\item Let $n = |\Irr(\Ac)|$ and 
let $\widehat\CM \in \mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$ be the image of $\CM(\Ac)$ under the canonical homomorphism $\mathrm{Mat}_n(\Zb) \to \mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$. We have
\be
	\mathrm{rank}\big(\widehat\CM \big) 
	~=~ \dim_k \Hig(\Ac) \ .
\ee
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}

In the context of this paper we are particularly interested in the case of factorisable and pivotal finite tensor categories $\Cc$. 
In this case we will later give a more direct description of $\Rey(\Cc)$ and $\Hig(\Cc)$ in terms of the $\phi_M$ defined in \eqref{eq:tildechi-def}, see Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span} below.
The next proposition shows in particular that Corollary~\ref{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general} is applicable to such $\Cc$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:cy-ssi-inclusion}
Let $\Cc$ be a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over $k$
	which satisfies Condition~P.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Proj(\Cc)$ admits a family of traces turning it into a Calabi-Yau category.
\item $\Cc$ is semisimple if and only if any one\ of the inclusions $\End(\Id_\Cc) \supset \Rey(\Cc) \supset \Hig(\Cc)$ is an equality. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Part 1 is immediate from Corollary~\ref{cor:factorisable-implies-trace}
by setting $\tCY_P:= t_P$ for any $P\in\Proj(\Cc)$, where $t$ is the modified trace on $\Proj(\Cc)$.
 For Part 2, the equivalence of semisimplicity to $\End(\Id_\Cc) = \Rey(\Cc)$ follows from Proposition~\ref{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)} and Lemma~\ref{lem:ZA=ReyA}. 

To show that $\Rey(\Cc) = \Hig(\Cc)$ is equivalent to semisimplicity of $\Cc$, we pick a projective generator $G$ and write $E=\End(G)$. 
Via the equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} to $\rmod{E}$, and by Propositions~\ref{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)} and \ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod}, 
the equality $\Rey(\Cc) = \Hig(\Cc)$ is equivalent to $\Rey(E)=\Hig(E)$, and by the isomorphisms in \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets} in turn to $R(E)=I(E)$.

Let $\widehat\CM$ be the image of $\CM(\Cc)$ in $\mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$ as in Corollary~\ref{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general}. We now show:

\medskip

\noindent
{\em Claim:} $R(E)=I(E)$ iff $\widehat\CM$ is non-degenerate.

\medskip

This claim completes the proof of part 2, since by \cite[Thm.\,6.6.1]{EGNO-book}, a pivotal finite tensor category over $k$
is semisimple if and only if $\widehat\CM$ is non-degenerate.

\medskip

\noindent
{\em Proof of claim:}
Recall from \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets} that the characters $\chi_M$ of $E$-modules $M$ span $R(E)$ (over~$k$) and those of projective $E$-modules span $I(E)$.
Using again the equivalence~\eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}, we have $\chi_{\tilde P_U} = \sum_{V \in \Irr(\Cc)} \widehat\CM_{UV} \, \chi_{\tilde V}$, where $\tilde X := \Cc(G,X)$ is the image of $X$ under the equivalence~\eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}. In particular, the image of the $k$-linear map described by the matrix~$\widehat\CM$ in the basis $\{ \chi_{\tilde V} \}_{V \in \Irr(\Cc)}$ of $R(E)$, is precisely $I(E)$.
We conclude that $R(E)=I(E)$ is equivalent to non-degeneracy of $\widehat\CM$, proving the claim.
\end{proof}

Part 2 of the proposition also follows from \cite[Cor.\,4.2\,\&\,Thm.\,5.12]{Shimizu:2015} together with Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span} below.
\footnote{
In \cite[Cor.\,2.3]{Cohen:2008} it is stated (among other things) that for a symmetric algebra $A$ over an  algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, $R(A)=I(A)$ implies that $A$ is semisimple. This would also imply part 2 of Proposition~\ref{prop:cy-ssi-inclusion}. However this statement is not true, as illustrated by the following counterexample (due to Ehud Meir): Take $A = k[X]/\langle X^2 \rangle$ and $\eps(1)=0$, $\eps(X)=1$. Then $A$ is a symmetric algebra. Its unique simple module is $k$ and the projective cover  of $k$ is $P_k=A$. We have $\chi_A = 2 \cdot \chi_k$. Thus $I(A)=R(A)$, but $A$ is not semisimple.

In \cite{Cohen:2008}, Corollary~2.3 is only used in Theorem~2.9, and there only the remaining parts of Corollary~2.3 are relevant, so that the above counterexample does not affect the other results in \cite{Cohen:2008} (we thank Miriam Cohen and Sara Westreich for correspondence on this point).

On the other hand, it is shown in \cite[Thm.\,2]{Lorenz:1997} that if $A$ is in addition a Hopf algebra such that the square of the antipode is inner, $R(A)=I(A)$ does indeed imply that $A$ is semisimple.
This is a special case of  \cite[Thm.\,6.6.1]{EGNO-book}.

\section{Characters and the modified trace}\label{sec:ch-tr}

In this section we fix 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Cc$ : a factorisable and pivotal finite tensor category over $k$
	which satisfies Condition~P
	given in the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:projsimpleex},
\item $t$ : a choice of non-zero modified trace on $\Proj(C)$ via Corollary~\ref{cor:factorisable-implies-trace},
\item $G$ : a projective generator for $\Cc$,
\item $E := \End(G)$, a symmetric $k$-algebra via $t_G$.
\end{itemize}

Recall from \eqref{eq:tildechi-def} the natural endomorphism $\phi_M \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$ assigned to each $M \in \Cc$. Note that $\phi_M$ is uniquely determined by $(\phi_M)_G \in E$, and that in fact $(\phi_M)_G \in Z(E)$.

For a given $M \in \Cc$ we can now define two central forms on $E$. Let $x \in E$. The first central form uses the Hom-tensor equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} and is given by $x \mapsto tr_{\Cc(G,M)}(x)$, the trace in the right $E$-module $\Cc(G,M)$ over the right action of $x$. The second form is 
$x \mapsto t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ x)$. The aim of this section is to prove our second main result:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:trace-vs-tG}
The modified trace $t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$ is non-zero,
 and
for all $M \in \Cc$ the following equality of central forms on $E$ holds:
\be\label{eq:trace-vs-tG}
	tr_{\Cc(G,M)}(-) ~=~ \frac{t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - )}{t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})} \ .
\ee
\end{theorem}


The proof relies on several intermediate results, which we present now.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:transp-morph}
Let $f: A \to B$ and suppose that for all $X \in \Cc$ we have
\be\label{eq:transp-morph}
	(f \otimes \id_X) \circ c_{X,A} \circ c_{A,X} = f \otimes \id_X \ .
\ee
Then there is $m>0$ and $a : A \to \one^{\oplus m}$, $b:  \one^{\oplus m} \to B$ such that $f = b \circ a$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Write $f = \big[A \xrightarrow{a} M \xrightarrow{b} B \big]$, where $a$ is epi and $b$ is mono. Rewrite \eqref{eq:transp-morph} as 
\be
	(b \otimes \id_X) \circ c_{X,M} \circ c_{M,X} \circ (a \otimes \id_X) = (b \otimes \id_X) \circ (a \otimes \id_X) \ .
\ee
By exactness of $\otimes$, also $a \otimes \id_X$ is epi and $b \otimes \id_X$ is mono. 
We conclude that $c_{X,M} \circ c_{M,X} = \id_{M \otimes X}$ for all $M$. 
{}From characterisation 1 of factorisability in Theorem~\ref{thm:factequiv}
it follows that $M \cong \one^{\oplus m}$ for some $m$.
\end{proof}

Recall the coend $\coend$
with its family $\iota_X$ of dinatural transformations
and its 
	non-zero
cointegral~$\coint_\coend$ from Section~\ref{sec:conventions}.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:lambdaLoiota_X}
For each $X \in \Cc$ there exist $m>0$, 
$a : X \to \one^{\oplus m}$, $b:  \one^{\oplus m} \to X$ (possibly zero) such that
\begin{align}
	\coint_\coend \circ \iota_X &~=~ \ev_X \circ \big(\id_{X^*} \otimes (b \circ a)\big)
	\nonumber \\
	&~=~ \sum_{\alpha=1}^m 
	\big[ X^*X \xrightarrow{(b_\alpha)^* \otimes a_\alpha} \one^*\one
	\xrightarrow{\ev_\one} \one \big]
\end{align}
where $a_\alpha : X \to \one$, $b_\alpha:  \one \to X$ are the components of $a,b$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By definition of the cointegral, we have 
\be
	\big[ \coend \xrightarrow{\Delta_\coend} \coend\coend \xrightarrow{\coint_\coend \otimes \id_\coend} \one \coend  \xrightarrow{\sim} \coend \big]
	~=~ \big[ \coend \xrightarrow{\coint_\coend} \one \xrightarrow{\eta_\coend} \coend \big] \ .
\ee
Combining this with the
pairing 
$\omega_\coend$ we obtain the following equality:
\be
	\big[ \coend\coend \xrightarrow{\Delta_\coend \otimes \id_\coend} (\coend\coend)\coend \xrightarrow{\sim} 
	\coend(\coend\coend) \xrightarrow{\coint_\coend \otimes \omega_\coend} \one \one \big]
	~=~ \big[ \coend\coend \xrightarrow{\coint_\coend \otimes \eps_\coend} \one\one \big] \ ,
\ee
where we used the property of the Hopf pairing that 
$\omega_\coend \circ (\eta_\coend\otimes \id_\coend) \circ \lambda_\coend^{-1} = \varepsilon_\coend$.
After pre-composing with $\iota_X \otimes \iota_Y$ and substituting the defining equations, a short calculation shows
\begin{align}
&
\big[ (X^*X)(Y^*Y) 
\xrightarrow{\sim} X^*((XY^*)Y)
\xrightarrow{\id \otimes (c_{Y^*,X} \circ c_{X,Y^*}) \otimes \id} X^*((XY^*)Y)
\nonumber\\
&
\hspace{15em} \xrightarrow{\sim} (X^*X)(Y^*Y) 
\xrightarrow{(\coint_\coend \circ \iota_X) \otimes \ev_Y} \one\one
\big]
\nonumber\\
&
=~
\big[ (X^*X)(Y^*Y) 
\xrightarrow{(\coint_\coend \circ \iota_X) \otimes \ev_Y} \one\one
\big]
\end{align}
Using the isomorphism $\Cc(X^*\otimes M,N) \xrightarrow{\sim}\Cc(M,X\otimes N)$  ,
\be
	h ~\longmapsto~
	\big[\, M \xrightarrow{\sim} \one M \xrightarrow{\coev_X \otimes \id} (XX^*)M \xrightarrow{\sim} X(X^*M) \xrightarrow{\id \otimes h} XN \, \big] \ ,
\ee
and similarly for $\Cc(M\otimes Y,N)\xrightarrow{\sim} \Cc(M,N\otimes Y^*)$,  the latter equality can be brought to the form 
 $(f \otimes \id_{Y^*}) \circ c_{Y^*,X} \circ c_{X,Y^*} = f \otimes \id_{Y^*}$ 
with
\be
	f ~=~
	\big[\, X \xrightarrow{\sim} \one X 
	\xrightarrow{\coev_X \otimes \id} (XX^*)X
	\xrightarrow{\sim}  X(X^*X)
	\xrightarrow{\id \otimes (\coint_\coend \circ \iota_X)  } X \one 
	\xrightarrow{\sim} X \,\big] \ .
\ee
Lemma~\ref{lem:transp-morph} now implies the claim.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:lambda-iota}
For $U \in \Cc$ simple, $U \ncong \one$, we have $\coint_\coend \circ \iota_{P_U}=0$. Furthermore, there exists a unique
 $\nu_\one : \one \to P_\one$ 
such that
\be\label{eq:lambda-iota}
	\coint_\coend \circ \iota_{P_\one} = \ev_\one \circ (\nu_\one^* \otimes \pi_\one) \ ,
\ee
where $\pi_\one : P_\one \to \one$ is the canonical projection of the projective cover.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:lambdaLoiota_X} and the fact that 
$\Cc(P_U,\one)$ and $\Cc(\one,P_U)$ are both zero-dimensional for $U \ncong \one$ and one-dimensional for $U \cong \one$
(by unimodularity of~$\Cc$).
\end{proof}

Recall the natural endomorphism $\phi_M$ in~\eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit}.
The next proposition computes its values on projective objects
and also shows that $\nu_\one$ (and all $\nu_U$ defined there) are non-zero.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:phi_U_PV}
Let $U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)$. Then  $(\phi_U)_{P_U} \neq 0$ and there exists a unique non-zero
$\nu_U : U \to P_U$ such that
\be\label{eq:phi_U_PV}
	(\phi_U)_{P_V}
	= \begin{cases} 0 &, \quad V \neq U \\
		\nu_U \circ \pi_U &, \quad  V = U 
		\end{cases}
\ee
where $\pi_U : P_U \to U$ is the canonical projection of the projective cover, and where $\nu_\one$ is the same as in Corollary~\ref{cor:lambda-iota}.
Moreover,
there exists a choice of $a: P_\one\to  P_U\otimes U^*$, $b: P_U\otimes U^* \to P_\one$ which realise $P_\one$ as a direct summand of $P_U\otimes U^*$ (i.e.\ $b\circ a  = \id_{P_\one}$), such that
\be\label{eq:phi_U_PV-diag}

\ee	
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
In the expression \eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit} for $(\phi_M)_X$  set $M=U$ and $X = P_V$. Write 
	$P_V \otimes  U^* \cong \bigoplus_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} P_W^{\,\oplus n_W}$ 
and pick 
 $a_{W,\alpha} \in \Cc(P_W ,  P_V \otimes U^* )$ and $b_{W,\alpha} \in \Cc(P_V \otimes U^*, P_W)$,
  $\alpha = 1,\dots,n_W$, 
 which realise the direct sum decomposition:
\be
b_{W,\alpha} \circ a_{W',\alpha'} = \delta_{W,W'} \, \delta_{\alpha,\alpha'} \, \id_{P_W}
\quad,\quad
\sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_W}  a_{W,\alpha} \circ b_{W,\alpha} =
 \id_{P_V \otimes U^*} \ .
\ee
For the dinatural transformation $\iota_{P_V \otimes U^*}$ in \eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit} consider the equalities
\begin{align}
\iota_{P_V \otimes U^*}
&=
\sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_W} 
\iota_{P_V \otimes U^*} \circ (\id_{(P_V \otimes U^*)^*} \otimes (
a_{W,\alpha} \circ b_{W,\alpha}))
\nonumber \\
&=
\sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_W} 
\iota_{P_W} \circ (a_{W,\alpha}^* \otimes b_{W,\alpha})
\label{eq:phi_U_PV-aux2}
\end{align}
{}From 
Corollary~\ref{cor:lambda-iota}, $\coint_\coend \circ \iota_{P_W} = 0$ for $W \ncong \one$, 
	and so
in the expression for $\coint_\coend  \circ \iota_{P_V \otimes U^*}$
  the sum over $W$ in \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV-aux2} reduces to $W=\one$. 
Since $\dim \Cc(P_W,R) = \delta_{W,R}$ for $W,R \in \Irr(\Cc)$, the multiplicities $n_W$ are given by $n_W = \dim \Cc(P_V \otimes U^*,W)$. In particular,
\be
n_\one = \dim \Cc(P_V \otimes U^*,\one) = \dim \Cc(P_V,U) = \delta_{U,V}\ .
\ee
 So in \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV-aux2} the sum over $\alpha$ is zero for $U \neq V$ and reduces to $\alpha=1$ for $U=V$. Together with \eqref{eq:lambda-iota} we obtain
\be
\coint_\coend \circ \iota_{P_V \otimes U^*}
~=~ \delta_{U,V}
\,
\ev_\one \circ 
\big(
 (a_{\one,1} \circ \nu_\one)^* \otimes (\pi_\one \circ b_{\one,1}) \big) \ .
\ee
Substituting this into \eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit} yields 
$(\phi_U)_{P_V}	= \delta_{U,V} \, \tilde\nu \circ \tilde\pi$
where
\be\label{eq:phi_U_PV-aux1}

It remains to show that we can achieve $\tilde\pi = \pi_U$, the chosen projection $P_U \to U$, and that for $U=\one$, $\tilde\nu$ agrees with $\nu_\one$ in \eqref{eq:lambda-iota}.

By 	Theorem~\ref{thm:chiinj},
in particular $\chi_U \neq 0$.
Since $\psi$ and $\rho$ are isomorphisms, also $\phi_U \neq 0$, and thus $\tilde\nu, \tilde\pi \neq 0$
	(or otherwise $\phi_U$ would vanish on all indecomposable
	projectives and hence be zero).
Since $\Cc(P_U,U)$ is one-dimensional, 
by rescaling $b_{\one,1}$ if necessary (and thus rescaling  $a_{\one,1}$ accordingly by the inverse factor) one can achieve 
$\tilde\pi = \pi_U$. 
This finally gives~\eqref{eq:phi_U_PV-diag}.

For $U = V = \one$, one can alternatively compute $(\phi_\one)_{P_\one}$ directly from \eqref{eq:phi_M-explicit} and \eqref{eq:lambda-iota}. A short calculation confirms that $\nu_\one$ from \eqref{eq:lambda-iota} agrees with $\tilde\nu$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:phi_U_V}
Let $U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)$, then $(\phi_U)_V  = 0$ unless $U=V$ and $U$ is projective.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
 By naturality of $\phi_U$ we have $\pi_V\circ(\phi_U)_{P_V} = (\phi_U)_V\circ \pi_V$.  Applying~\eqref{eq:phi_U_PV} to LHS of the last equality and using $\pi_V \circ \nu_V = 0$ for $V$ non-projective, we get  the statement.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:trace-vs-tG}]
 We will show
  $t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - ) = z \cdot tr_{\Cc(G,M)}(-)$
  and then determine $z \in k$ to be $t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$.
Write $G = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} P_U^{\oplus n_U}$ and let $e_{U,\alpha}$, $U \in \Irr(\Cc)$, $\alpha = 1,\dots,n_U$ be the corresponding primitive orthogonal idempotents. 
Pick
$j_{U,\alpha} : P_U \to G$, $q_{U,\alpha} : G \to P_U$ such that 
\be\label{eq:qj-e}
q_{U,\alpha}  \circ j_{M,\beta} = \delta_{U,M}\,\delta_{\alpha,\beta} \, \id_{P_U} \qquad  \text{and} \qquad
j_{U,\alpha}  \circ q_{U,\alpha} = e_{U,\alpha}   \  .
\ee
As for any finite-dimensional associative algebra, the quotient $E/ \Jac(E)$ is a direct sum over 
	$U\in\Irr(\Cc)$ 
of $n_U{\times}n_U$-matrix algebras, and 
	the
$j_{U,\alpha} \circ q_{U,\beta}$ form a basis in these matrix algebras.
Therefore, the endomorphism algebra $E$ decomposes (as
a vector space) as
\be
	E ~=~ \bigoplus_{U,\alpha,\beta} k\,  j_{U,\alpha} \circ q_{U,\beta} ~\oplus~ \Jac(E) \ .
\ee

To show
 $t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - ) = z \cdot \mathrm{tr}_{\Cc(G,M)}(-)$
  it is enough to consider $M \in \Irr(\Cc)$. 
In this case, $\tilde M := \Cc(G,M)$ is an irreducible $E$-module of dimension $n_M$. 
The trace $\mathrm{tr}_{\tilde M}(-)$ vanishes on $\Jac(E)$ while on semisimple part it gives
\be\label{eq:trace-vs-tG-aux1}
	\mathrm{tr}_{\tilde M}(j_{U,\alpha} \circ q_{U,\beta}) = \delta_{U,M} \,\delta_{\alpha,\beta} \ .
\ee

	It remains to check that evaluating $t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - )$ on $j_{U,\alpha} \circ q_{U,\beta}$ leads to the same result, up to a factor of $t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$. 
	We have, for all $U \in \Irr(\Cc)$,
\begin{align}
	(\phi_U)_G
	&\overset{\eqref{eq:qj-e}}=
	\sum_{V \in \Irr(\Cc)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_V} 
	j_{V,\alpha} \circ q_{V,\alpha} \circ (\phi_U)_G 
	\overset{\text{$\phi_U$ nat.}}=
	\sum_{V \in \Irr(\Cc)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_V} 
	j_{V,\alpha} \circ (\phi_U)_{P_V} \circ q_{V,\alpha}  
\nonumber\\
	&\overset{\text{Prop.~\ref{prop:phi_U_PV}}}=~
		\sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_U} 
	j_{U,\alpha} \circ \nu_U\circ \pi_U \circ q_{U,\alpha}   \ .
\label{eq:trace-vs-tG-aux2}
\end{align}
By~\eqref{eq:JG-Jac} the map $\pi_U\circ q_{U,\alpha}\colon G\to U$ annihilates $\Jac(E)$ and therefore
 $(\phi_U)_G \circ \Jac(E) = 0$.
Thus also $t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - )$ vanishes on $\Jac(E)$. Furthermore,
\be\label{eq:trace-vs-tG-aux3}
t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ j_{U,\alpha} \circ q_{U,\beta} ) = \delta_{U,M}\,\delta_{\alpha,\beta} \, z
\quad ,  \quad \text{where} \quad 
z = t_{P_M}((\phi_M)_{P_M}) \ ,
\ee
and where we used  first cyclicity of $t$, then naturality of $\phi_M$ and then~\eqref{eq:qj-e} and~\eqref{eq:phi_U_PV}.
To arrive at $z = t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$,
	we first observe that
\be\label{eq:proof-trace-vs-tG-aux}
 (\phi_M)_{P_M}  ~= 
  \raisebox{-0.5\height}{\setlength{\unitlength}{.75pt}

     \put (18,105) {\scriptsize$ \pi_\one $}
     }
     \setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}}
  \end{picture}}
  \qquad .
\ee
	To see this, first use \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV} and substitute the explicit expressions for $\nu_M, \pi_M$ from \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV-diag}. 
Next use the pivotal structure to insert $\id_M = \big[ M \xrightarrow{\delta_M} M^{**} \xrightarrow{\delta_M^{-1}} M \big]$ 
and combine $\delta, \delta^{-1}$ with the evaluation and coevaluation maps as in~\eqref{eq:ev-coev-tilde}, thereby replacing $M$ by $M^{**}$ in the right-most strand of the above diagram. We can now compute
\begin{align}
	t_{P_M}\big( (\phi_M)_{P_M} \big)
	&	\overset{\text{(*)}}{=} 
	t_{P_M \otimes M^*}\big( a \circ \nu_\one \circ \pi_\one \circ b \big)
	\nonumber\\&
	\overset{\text{cycl.}}{=} 
	t_{P_\one}\big( \nu_\one \circ \pi_\one \circ b \circ a \big)
	\overset{\eqref{eq:phi_U_PV}}{=}
	t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one}) \ ,
	\label{eq:tPMphiM=tP1phi1}
\end{align}
where in (*) we have rewritten \eqref{eq:proof-trace-vs-tG-aux} as a partial trace and used compatibility of the modified trace with partial traces
in~\eqref{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace}.

So far we proved 
$t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ - ) = z \cdot tr_{\tilde M}(-)$ with $z =t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$. It remains to show that $z \neq 0$. 
By Theorem \ref{thm:chiinj} and \eqref{eq:tildechi-def}, $\phi_M \neq 0$ for $M \in \Irr(\Cc)$. Hence also $(\phi_M)_G \neq 0$. By non-degeneracy of the pairings \eqref{eq:pairingMP} (Corollary \ref{cor:factorisable-implies-trace}), there is an $f \in E$ such that $t_G((\phi_M)_G \circ f ) \neq 0$. In particular, $z \neq 0$.
\end{proof}

As a corollary to the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:trace-vs-tG}, specifically 
	\eqref{eq:tPMphiM=tP1phi1} (using also Proposition~\ref{prop:phi_U_PV}),
 we obtain that, for $A,B \in \Irr(\Cc)$,
\be\label{eq:mod-trace-on-phiA}
	t_{P_A}\big(\, (\phi_B)_{P_A} \,\big) ~=~ \delta_{A,B}  \cdot t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one}) \ .

\section{Properties of the Reynolds and Higman ideals}

In this section $k$, $\Cc$, $t$, $G$ and $E$ have the same meaning as in the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:ch-tr}.
We give an
alternative description of the Reynolds and Higman ideals defined in Section~\ref{sec:sym-alg-ideal} in terms of the $\phi_U$. Then we describe the multiplication in these ideals.

\medskip

We start with the alternative  description of $\Rey(\Cc)$ and $\Hig(\Cc)$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:ReyHig=span}
We have
\be
\Rey(\Cc) = \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,\phi_M \,\big|\, M\in\Cc \, \big\}
\quad , \quad
\Hig(\Cc) = \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,\phi_P \,\big|\, P\in\Proj(\Cc) \, \big\} \ .
\ee
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Abbreviate $S= \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,(\phi_M)_G \,\big|\, M\in\Cc \, \big\}$ and $S'= \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,(\phi_P)_G \,\big|\, P\in\Proj(\Cc) \, \big\}$.
By Propositions~\ref{prop:Rey(Amod)=Rey(A)} and \ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod} it is enough to show 
$\Rey(E) = S$
and
$\Hig(E) = S'$.

The image of $S$ under the map $\zeta$ from \eqref{eq:zeta:ZA-CA} 
(we take $\varepsilon=t_G$)
 is given by
$\zeta(S) = \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,t_G
\big((\phi_M)_G\circ-\big) 
\,\big|\, M\in\Cc \, \big\}$. Theorem~\ref{thm:trace-vs-tG} allows us to rewrite this as
\be
\zeta(S) = \mathrm{span}_k\big\{\,tr_{\Cc(G,M)}(-) \,\big|\, M\in\Cc \, \big\} = R(E)\ ,
\ee
 where for the last equality we used the definition of $R(E)$ below \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets} and that every $E$-module is isomorphic to $\Cc(G,M)$ for some $M$ (equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}). But by the isomorphisms in \eqref{eq:ZA-CA-subsets} the equality $\zeta(S)=R(E)$ implies $S=\Rey(E)$.

An analogous argument shows $S' = \Hig(E)$.
\end{proof}


The next proposition shows that the action of $\End(\Cc)$ on $\Rey(\Cc)$ is diagonal in the basis  
 $\{\, \phi_{U} \,|\, U \in \Irr(\Cc)\, \}$. 

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:phiU-End-diagonal}
For $\alpha \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$ and $U \in \Irr(\Cc)$ 
we have
\be\label{eq:phiU-End-diagonal}
	\alpha \circ \phi_{U}
	~=~
	\langle\alpha_U\rangle \cdot \phi_{U} \ ,
\ee 
where 
$\langle\alpha_U\rangle \in k$ is determined by $\alpha_U = \langle\alpha_U\rangle\,\id_U$. If $U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)$ lie in the same block of~$\Cc$, then $\langle\alpha_U\rangle = \langle\alpha_V\rangle$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We pick a projective generator $G$ and use the equivalence in \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv}. 
Let $e_1,\dots,e_b \in Z(E)$ be the primitive central idempotents. The $e_j$ decompose $E$ as an algebra into indecomposable direct summands, or, equivalently, via \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} they decompose $\Cc$ into blocks.


Abbreviate $z := \alpha_G \in Z(E)$. We can write 
	$z = \sum_{j=1}^b y_j e_j + n$ for some $y_j \in k$, $n \in \Jac(E)$. 
Suppose $U$ is in the $j$'th block of $\Cc$, that is, $z$ acts on the simple $E$-module $\Cc(G,U)$ by $y_j \,\id$. Then $\langle\alpha_U\rangle = y_j$, proving the second statement.

By Proposition~\ref{prop:phi_U_PV}, $(\phi_U)_G$ factors through the semisimple $E$-module $\Cc(G,U)^{\oplus m}$ for some $m$. Hence $z \,(\phi_U)_G = y_j \, (\phi_U)_G$, proving the first statement.
\end{proof}



\begin{remark}\label{rem:also-PU-diag}
Together with Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span},
Proposition~\ref{prop:phiU-End-diagonal} states that $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ acts diagonalisably on 
$\Rey(\Cc)$, with eigenbasis given by $\{ \phi_U \,|\, U \in \Irr(\Cc) \}$. 
Since the value of 
$\alpha \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$ on $\phi_U$ only depends on the block of $U$, and since all composition factors of an indecomposable projective belong to the same block, we equally have
\be\label{eq:phiPU-End-diagonal}
	\alpha \circ \phi_{P_U}
	~=~
	\langle\alpha_U\rangle \cdot \phi_{P_U} \ ,
\ee 
with $\langle\alpha_U\rangle$ as in Proposition~\ref{prop:phiU-End-diagonal}.
\end{remark}


By Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span}, $\Hig(\Cc)$ is spanned by the $\phi_P$, $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$. From this formulation, we see that $\Hig(\Cc)$ contains a natural subspace, namely the span of all $\phi_Q$ for $Q$ is both simple and projective.\footnote{
  Via the equivalence \eqref{eq:C-modE-equiv} to symmetric algebras, this subspace corresponds to the 
	subspace 
of the centre denoted by $Z_0$ in \cite{Cohen:2008}.} 
For each simple projective object $Q$, by
	Proposition~\ref{prop:phi_U_PV}
and since $\phi_Q \neq 0$, there is a non-zero $b_Q \in k$ such that
\be\label{eq:phi_U_PV_simproj}
	(\phi_Q)_{P_V}
	= \begin{cases} 0 &
	,\qquad
	 P_V \ncong Q \\
		b_Q \cdot \id_{P_V} &
		,\qquad
		 P_V \cong Q 
		\end{cases}
	\qquad .
\ee
	This allows for another expression of the normalisation constant $t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})$ in \eqref{eq:trace-vs-tG},
namely, for $Q$ a simple projective object,
\be\label{eq:tP1phiP1-via-tQidQ}
	t_{P_\one}\big((\phi_\one)_{P_\one}\big) 
	\overset{\eqref{eq:tPMphiM=tP1phi1}}=
	t_Q\big((\phi_Q)_Q\big)
	~=~ 
	b_Q \cdot t_Q(\id_Q) \ .
\ee
For later use we define
\be\label{eq:IrrProj-def}
	\mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc) ~=~ \{\, U \in \Irr(\Cc) \,|\,
	\text{$U$ is projective } \} \ .
\ee
By Theorem~\ref{thm:main-simpleproj}, this set is not empty.
We can use this notation to describe the product in $\Rey(\Cc)$ and $\Hig(\Cc)$:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:prod-Rey-Hig}
We have, for $U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)$,
\be
\phi_U \circ \phi_V
~=~
	\delta_{U,V} \, 
	\delta_{V \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)} \,
	b_V  \, \phi_{V} 
\quad , \quad
	\phi_{P_U} 
	\circ
	\phi_{P_V}
	~=~
	\delta_{U,V} \, 
	\delta_{V \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)} \,
	b_V  \, \phi_{P_V} \ .
\ee
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Proposition~\ref{prop:phiU-End-diagonal}, $\phi_U \circ \phi_V = \langle (\phi_U)_V \rangle \cdot \phi_V$.
By Corollary~\ref{cor:phi_U_V}, $\langle (\phi_U)_V \rangle = 0$ unless $U=V$ and $U$ is projective.
The definition of $b_Q$ in \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV_simproj} now
	implies
the first equality. 
For the second equality,
expand $\phi_{P_U} = \sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} [P_U:W] \phi_W$, and similar for $\phi_{P_V}$. Since $P_U$ can only contain a composition factor from $\mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)$ if already $U \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)$, the second equality follows from the first.
\end{proof}

\section{$\boldsymbol{S}$-invariance of projective characters}\label{sec:Sinv-proj}

In this section $k$, $\Cc$, $t$, $G$ and $E$ have the same meaning as in the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:ch-tr}.
Here we prove our third main result, namely that the Higman ideal of $\Cc$ gets mapped to itself under the action of $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$.
As applications, we 
investigate the action of the Grothendieck ring on $\Rey(\Cc)$ and $\Hig(\Cc)$, then give a variant of the Verlinde formula for projective objects and we show how matrix coefficients of $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ on $\Hig(\Cc)$ are related to
the  modified trace.

\medskip

Recall the definition of $\smap : \Gr(\Cc)_k \to \End(\Id_\Cc)$ from 
\eqref{eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:sigP-ann-Jac}
Let $P \in \Cc$ be projective and let $f \in \Jac(E)$. Then $\smap([P])_G \circ f = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $t_G$ induces a non-degenerate pairing on $E$ (Corollary~\ref{cor:factorisable-implies-trace}), it is enough to show that for all $x \in E$, 
$t_G\big(\smap([P])_G \circ f \circ x\big) = 0$.
Combining the explicit expression of $\smap([P])_G$ as a partial trace in~\eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic}
and  Lemma~\ref{lem:exchange-partial-trace} 
we see
\be\label{eq:sigP-ann-Jac-aux1}
  t_G\big(\smap([P])_G \circ f \circ x\big) 
  = 
  t_{P^*}\Big( tr^r_G\big(c_{G,P^*} \circ ((f\circ x) \otimes \id_{P^*}) 
  \circ c_{P^*,G}\big) \Big) \ .
\ee
As $f \in \Jac(E) = J_G$ (recall \eqref{eq:JG-Jac}), for all $U \in \Cc$ simple and all $u : G \to U$, we have $u \circ f = 0$, and hence also $u \circ f \circ x = 0$.
Corollary~\ref{cor:dinat-jac-0} now shows that the right hand side of \eqref{eq:sigP-ann-Jac-aux1} is zero.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label{cor:sig(P)inReyC}
Let $P \in \Cc$ be projective. Then 
$\smap([P]) \in \Rey(\Cc)$.
\end{corollary}

For each $U \in \Irr(\Cc)$ choose a primitive idempotent $e_U \in E$ corresponding to the projective cover 
of the irreducible representation $\Cc(G,U)$ of $E$. That is, 
	$e_UE \cong \Cc(G,P_U)$
as right $E$-modules. We remark here that by \eqref{eq:trace-vs-tG-aux3}
we have for $U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)$,
\be\label{eq:phiU-eV-ortho}
	t_G((\phi_U)_G  \circ e_V) ~=~ z\, \delta_{U,V} \ ,
\ee
where we set $z = t_{P_\one}((\phi_\one)_{P_\one})\ne 0$ as above.
{}From  this equality and 
Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span} it
follows that the pairing
\be\label{eq:Rey-idemp-pairing}
\Rey(\Cc) \times \mathrm{span}_k\big\{e_V \,\big|\, V \in \Irr(\Cc) \big\} \longrightarrow k
\quad , \quad
(r,u) \mapsto t_G(r \circ u)
\ee
is non-degenerate.

Let us abbreviate 
	the image of the Cartan matrix $\CM(\Cc)$ in $\mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$ by $\widehat\CM$, cf.\ Corollary~\ref{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general}. For $x \in \ker(\widehat\CM)$ write 
$\tilde x = \sum_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} x_U e_U \in E$. 
We define
\be
	K^\perp := \big\{ \,r \in \Rey(\Cc) \,\big|\, t_G
	(r_G \circ \tilde x) =0 \text{ for all }
	x \in \ker(\widehat\CM) \big\} \ .
\ee

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:Hig-Kperp}
$\Hig(\Cc) = K^\perp$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We first show that $\Hig(\Cc) \subset K^\perp$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span} we need to show that for all $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$
and $x \in \ker(\widehat\CM)$, 
	$t_G\big( (\phi_P)_G  \circ \tilde x\big)=0$. 
It is enough to consider the projective covers $P_U$, $U \in \Irr(\Cc)$. 
By \eqref{eq:composition-series-proj-cover} we have 
	$\phi_{P_U} = \sum_{V \in \Irr(\Cc)} \widehat\CM_{UV} \, \phi_V$. 
Using this, we compute
\begin{align}
t_G\big((\phi_{P_U})_G  \circ \tilde x\big)
&~=
\hspace{-.4em} \sum_{V,W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \hspace{-.8em} \widehat\CM_{UV} \, x_W \, t_G\big((\phi_V)_G  \circ e_W\big)
\nonumber \\ &
	\overset{\eqref{eq:phiU-eV-ortho}}=
\hspace{-.4em} \sum_{V,W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \hspace{-.8em} \widehat\CM_{UV}\,  x_W \, \delta_{V,W} \, z
\overset{x \in \ker(\widehat\CM)}= 
0 \ .
\end{align}
	By non-degeneracy of the pairing \eqref{eq:Rey-idemp-pairing},
we have $\dim_k K^\perp = \mathrm{rank}(\widehat\CM)$, the rank of the Cartan matrix,
	seen as a matrix over $k$. 
Hence by Corollary~\ref{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general}, $\dim_k K^\perp = \dim_k \Hig(\Cc)$.
\end{proof}

The following theorem generalises results of~\cite{Lachowska-center,Cohen:2008} as mentioned in the introduction.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:projective-S-inv}
$\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\Hig(\Cc)) = \Hig(\Cc)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We will show $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\Hig(\Cc)) \subset K^\perp$. 
	Let $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$. 
By Corollary~\ref{cor:sig(P)inReyC}
	and \eqref{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM},
$\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_P) \in \Rey(\Cc)$. It remains to check that $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_P) \in K^\perp$, i.e.\ that $t_G\big((\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_P))_G \circ \tilde x\big)=0$ for all 
$x \in \ker(\widehat\CM)$. 
We compute
\begin{align}
& t_G\big((\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_P))_G \circ \tilde x\big)
\overset{\text{as in \eqref{eq:sigP-ann-Jac-aux1}}}=
  t_{P^*}\big( tr_G^r(c_{G,P^*} \circ (\tilde x \otimes \id_{P^*}) 
  \circ c_{P^*,G}) \big)
\nonumber \\ &
\overset{\text{(*)}}=
\sum_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} x_U \, t_{P^*}\big( \sigma([P_{U^*}])_{P^*} \big)
\overset{\eqref{eq:composition-series-proj-cover}}=
\sum_{U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)} x_U \, \widehat\CM_{U^*V}\, t_{P^*}\big( \sigma([V])_{P^*} \big)
\nonumber \\ &
\overset{\text{(**)}}=
\sum_{U,V \in \Irr(\Cc)} \widehat\CM_{V^*U}\, x_U \, t_{P^*}\big( \sigma([V])_{P^*} \big)
\overset{x \in \ker(\widehat\CM)}=
0 \ .
\end{align}
In (*) we inserted $\tilde x = \sum_{U} x_U \, e_U$ and used
that $e_U=a\circ b$, for $a\colon P_U\to G$, $b\colon G\to P_U$ realising the direct summand $P_U$ in $G$,  
and moving $b$ around the loop we get  $b\circ a = \id_{P_U}$.
The reason that $U^*$ appears instead of $U$ is the extra dual in \eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic},
  together with $(P_U)^* \cong P_{U^*}$ (as follows from uni-modularity of $\Cc$)
\footnote{Applying  \eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic} for $\sigma(V^*)_{X}$, then  inserting $\delta_V \circ \delta_V^{-1}\colon V^{**}\to V\to V^{**}$ and  moving $\delta_V^{-1}$ once around the loop, we get a loop coloured by $V$ instead of $V^{**}$.}.
	This isomorphism, combined with \eqref{eq:cartan-mat-def}, shows $\CM_{U,V} = \CM_{V^*,U^*}$
	(and hence $\widehat\CM_{U,V} = \widehat\CM_{V^*,U^*}$),
which explains (**).

The inclusion $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\Hig(\Cc)) \subset K^\perp$ implies the theorem since $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ is an isomorphism 
	(Remark~\ref{rem:SC-iso-iff-fact})
and so together with Lemma~\ref{lem:Hig-Kperp} we have $\dim_k(\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\Hig(\Cc))) = \dim_k \Hig(\Cc) = \dim_k K^\perp$. Thus $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\Hig(\Cc)) = K^\perp = \Hig(\Cc)$, once more appealing to Lemma~\ref{lem:Hig-Kperp}.
\end{proof}


Recall the projective $SL(2,\Zb)$-action on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$ from Theorem~\ref{thm:proj-sl2Z-EndId} in case $\Cc$ is in addition ribbon.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:Hig-SL2Z-sub}
Let $\Cc$ be in addition ribbon. Then $\Hig(\Cc)$ is a submodule for the projective $SL(2,\Zb)$-action on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:projective-S-inv}, $\Hig(\Cc)$ is stable under the action of the $S$-generator of $SL(2,\Zb)$.
The action of $T$ is given by $\theta \circ (-)$, and since $\Hig(\Cc)$ is an ideal, it is stable under the $T$-action as well.
\end{proof}

\medskip

We now give applications of Theorem~\ref{thm:projective-S-inv} to the
problem of diagonalisability of the
Grothendieck ring of $\Cc$ (Proposition \ref{prop:GrC-diagonalisability}), 
to the Verlinde formula (Proposition~\ref{prop:M-via-S}) 
and to the modified trace (Proposition~\ref{prop:mod-tr-S}). 
Namely, we ask how much can be learned about the tensor products of projective objects from knowing the restriction of $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ to $\Hig(\Cc)$,
and give a formula for the modified trace of the ``open Hopf-link operator'' $\sigma([P])$ in terms of the $S$-matrix elements.
See e.g.\ \cite{Fuchs:2003yu,Fuchs:2006nx,Gainutdinov:2016qhz,Creutzig:2016fms} 
for discussions of the Verlinde formula in the finitely non-semisimple setting and for more references.


\medskip

We start with the application to the Grothendieck ring.
Recall from Corollary \ref{cor:inj-alg-hom} that $[M] \mapsto \smap([M])$ is an injective ring homomorphism 
from $\Gr(\Cc)$ to $\End(\Id_\Cc)$. For $M \in \Cc$ denote by 
\be
\rho^L([M])\colon\; \End(\Id_\Cc) \to \End(\Id_\Cc)
\ee
 the left multiplication by $\smap([M])$.
Then $\rho^L([A])  \rho^L([B]) 
= \rho^L([A]\cdot [B])$ and $\rho^L([\one]) = \id$, i.e.\ $\rho^L\colon \Gr(\Cc) \to \End_k(\End(\Id_\Cc))$ defines a 
	faithful
representation. Since $\Rey(\Cc)$ and $\Hig(\Cc)$ are ideals, they are submodules for the representation $\rho^L$.

We can now state the following result, part 1 of which is a generalisation of (part of) \cite[Thm.\,3.14]{Cohen:2008}.


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:GrC-diagonalisability}
Consider the action $\rho^L : \Gr(\Cc) \to \End_k(\End(\Id_\Cc))$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The restriction of $\rho^L$ to the submodule $\Rey(\Cc)$, respectively $\Hig(\Cc)$, is diagonalisable
with action
\be
	\rho^L([M]) \, \phi_{V}
	\,=~
	\ell^M_V
	\, \phi_{V} \ ,
\qquad \text{resp.} \qquad
	\rho^L([M]) \, \phi_{P_V}
	\,=~
	\ell^M_V 
	\, \phi_{P_V} \ ,
\ee
where 
	$V \in \Irr(\Cc)$ and
	$\ell^M_V  := \big\langle \smap([M])_V \big\rangle \in k$ (see Proposition~\ref{prop:phiU-End-diagonal}).
\item If $\Cc$ is semisimple, $\rho^L$ can be diagonalised on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$.
\item If $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$ and $\rho^L$ can be diagonalised on $\End(\Id_\Cc)$, then $\Cc$ is semisimple.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
Part 1 is immediate from Proposition~\ref{prop:phiU-End-diagonal}
and Remark~\ref{rem:also-PU-diag}.
Part~2 follows from part~1 together with Proposition~\ref{prop:cy-ssi-inclusion}, which states that for $\Cc$ semisimple we have $\Hig(\Cc)=\End(\Id_\Cc)$.

Part 3 we prove by contradiction. Suppose that $\Cc$ is not semisimple, so that not every indecomposable projective object is simple. 
Let $P$ be such a non-simple indecomposable projective object. 
Since $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$, the map $\Gr(\Cc) \to \Gr_k(\Cc)$ is injective, and hence by Theorem \ref{thm:chiinj} (and the definition in \eqref{eq:tildechi-def}), $\phi_P \neq 0$.
Furthermore, by Proposition~\ref{prop:prod-Rey-Hig}, $\phi_P$ is nilpotent, in fact $\phi_P \circ \phi_P=0$. 

Since $\phi_P \in \Hig(\Cc)$ (Proposition~\ref{prop:ReyHig=span}), by Theorem~\ref{thm:projective-S-inv}, we can write $\phi_P = \mathscr{S}_\Cc^{-1}(\sigma([P]))  = \sum_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} x_U \, \sigma([P_U])$ and this linear combination is nilpotent because $\phi_P \circ \phi_P = 0$. Then, since  $\sigma$ is an injective 
	algebra map
(Corollary~\ref{cor:inj-alg-hom}), $\Gr_k(\Cc)$ contains a non-zero nilpotent element, and so $\rho^L$ (which factors through $\Gr_k(\Cc)$) cannot be diagonalised.
\end{proof}
	
In particular, we have the following consequence for the linearised Grothendieck ring:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:Grss-Css}
If $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$,
the linearised Grothendieck ring $\Gr_k(\Cc)$ is semisimple iff $\Cc$ is semisimple.
\end{corollary}


\medskip

Next we turn to an application of Theorem \ref{thm:projective-S-inv} to a Verlinde-type formula.

\medskip

Write $\{M\}$ for the isomorphism class of an object $M \in \Cc$ (rather than its class $[M]$ in $\Gr(\Cc)$). Define the ring $K_0(\Cc)$ as the free abelian group spanned by the isomorphism classes of indecomposable projective objects
	(see e.g.\ \cite[Sec.\,1.8]{EGNO-book}),
\be
K_0(\Cc) ~:= \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Cc)} \Zb\, \{P_U\} \ .
\ee
The product of $\{P_U\}$ and $\{P_V\}$ is defined by the decomposition of $P_U \otimes P_V$ into indecomposable projectives.
	Thus $K_0(\Cc)$ encodes the tensor products of projective objects in $\Cc$ up to isomorphism. 
We denote the structure constants of $K_0(\Cc)$ by $M_{UV}^{~W}$, that is,
\be\label{eq:proj-M-def}
	\{P_U\} \{P_V\} ~= \sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} M_{UV}^{~W} \, \{P_W\} \ ,
\ee
or, equivalently,
\be
	P_U \otimes P_V ~\cong \bigoplus_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} (P_W)^{\oplus M_{UV}^{~W}} \ .
\ee
The map $K_0(\Cc) \to \Gr(\Cc)$, $\{P_U\} \mapsto [P_U]$ is a ring homomorphism. The matrix elements of this map are precisely the entries of the Cartan matrix of $\Cc$.

For the application to the Verlinde formula, 
we will need two bases of $\Hig(\Cc)$. For the first basis, choose a subset $J \subset \Irr(\Cc)$ such that
\be\label{eq:choice-Hig-basis1}
	\big\{\, \phi_{P_U} \,\big|\, U \in J \,\big\}
\ee
is a basis of $\Hig(\Cc)$. 
	Recall that $\widehat\CM$ denotes the image of $\CM(\Cc)$ in $\mathrm{Mat}_n(k)$.
By Corollary~\ref{cor:cartan-sym+rank_general} we have 
	$|J| = \mathrm{rank}(\widehat\CM)$. 
By Theorem~\ref{thm:projective-S-inv}, $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ is an invertible endomorphism of $\Hig(\Cc)$. The second basis then is
\be\label{eq:choice-Hig-basis2}
	\big\{\, \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_{P_U}) \,\big|\, U \in J \,\big\} \ .
\ee
Let $\tilde B$ be the $\Irr(\Cc) \times J$-matrix expressing $\phi_{P_U}$ in the first basis,
\be\label{eq:tildeB-expansion}
	\phi_{P_U}
	=
	\sum_{A \in J}
	\tilde B_{UA} \, \phi_{P_A} 
	\qquad , \quad \text{for} ~~U\in\Irr(\Cc) \ .
\ee
The change of basis map between \eqref{eq:choice-Hig-basis1} and \eqref{eq:choice-Hig-basis2} will be denoted by the $J \times J$-matrix~$\tilde S$, that is
\be\label{eq:tildeS-in-basis-def}
	\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_{P_A})
	=
	\sum_{B \in J}
	\tilde S_{AB} \,\phi_{P_B} 
	\qquad , \quad \text{for} ~~A\in J \ .
\ee
Finally, let 
$\tilde C$ be the $J \times J$-matrix which describes the effect of taking duals,
\be\label{eq:tildeC-def}
	\phi_{(P_A)^*}
	=
	\sum_{B \in J}
	\tilde C_{AB}\,\phi_{P_B} 
	\qquad , \quad \text{for} ~~A\in J \ .
\ee
By construction, $\tilde S$ and $\tilde C$ are invertible, while $\tilde B$ is invertible if and only if $\Cc$ is semisimple  (Proposition~\ref{prop:cy-ssi-inclusion}).


Recall the definition of the constants $b_Q \in k^\times$ from \eqref{eq:phi_U_PV_simproj} and of the subset $\mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc) \subset \Irr(\Cc)$ from \eqref{eq:IrrProj-def}. We remark that in order to get a basis in \eqref{eq:choice-Hig-basis1} one necessarily has $\mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc) \subset J$. 


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:M-via-S}
For all $U,V \in\Irr(\Cc)$ and $X \in J$
	we have the following identity in $k$,
\be\label{eq:M-via-S}
\sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} \hspace{-.5em} M_{UV}^{~W} \, \tilde B_{WX}
~=
 \hspace{-.1em}
\sum_{Q \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)} \hspace{-.9em}
b_Q\,  (\tilde B\cdot \tilde S)_{UQ} \,  (\tilde B\cdot \tilde S)_{VQ}  
\, (\tilde S \cdot \tilde C)_{QX}  \ .
\ee
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
{}From \eqref{eq:proj-M-def} we get the identity
\be
	\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_{P_U}) \circ  \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_{P_V})
	~= \sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} M_{UV}^{~W} \, \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_{P_W})
	\ .
\ee
Substituting \eqref{eq:tildeB-expansion} and \eqref{eq:tildeS-in-basis-def} gives
\begin{align}
\sum_{A,B,X,Y \in J} \hspace{-.8em}
\tilde B_{UA} \, \tilde B_{VB}

\label{eq:M-via-S_aux1}
\end{align}
Next note that $\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_M)) = \phi_{M^*}$ for all $M \in \Cc$ (as the square of $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ results in the action of the antipode of  $\coend$,
 see \cite{Lyubashenko:1995} and 
 e.g.\ \cite[Lem.\,5.7]{FGRprep1}). 
 This results in the matrix identity $\tilde S \cdot \tilde S = \tilde C$.
 Hence $\tilde S$ and $\tilde C$ commute and $\tilde S^{-1} = \tilde S \cdot \tilde C$, as $\tilde C^2$ is the identity matrix.
Multiplying both sides of \eqref{eq:M-via-S_aux1} by $\tilde S^{-1}$ yields the claim.
\end{proof}


Note that \eqref{eq:M-via-S} does not determine $M_{UV}^{~W}$ uniquely unless $\Cc$ is semisimple 
	and $k$ is of characteristic zero.
Indeed, otherwise $\tilde B$ does not have a right inverse
	and $M_{UV}^{~W}$ is considered as an element of $k$, i.e.\ modulo $\mathrm{char}(k)$.


\begin{remark}\label{rem:VOA-S-trans-proj}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item
Recall from Remark~\ref{rem:motivation}\,(2) that one of the motivations for this paper comes from vertex operator algebras. Let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra as in  Remark~\ref{rem:motivation}\,(2). 
In \cite[Conj.\,5.10]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz}, a precise conjecture is made on how the behaviour of so-called pseudo-trace functions of $V$ under the modular 
$S$-transformation is related to $\mathscr{S}_\Cc$ for $\Cc = \Rep(V)$. In this relation, $\phi_M \in \End(\Id_\Cc)$ corresponds to the character of the $V$-module $M$ (and not to a pseudo-trace function). Characters and their modular properties are much more accessible than
	those of
pseudo-trace functions. That is, from a vertex operator algebra perspective, the following pieces of information are typically more accessible than the structure constants $M_{UV}^{~W}$ themselves:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tilde B_{UA}$, $\tilde C_{AB}$ (find the projective modules of $V$ and analyse their composition series as well as those of their contragredient modules),
\item $\tilde S_{AB}$ (compute the modular $S$-transformation of characters of projective modules),
\item $b_Q$ (compute the modular $S$-transformation of the vacuum character and take the inverse of the coefficient of the character of $Q$).
\end{itemize}
Here the text in brackets indicates the computation one needs to do for $V$-modules, provided one assumes the conjectures in \cite{Gainutdinov:2016qhz}. 
For the last point note that
by \eqref{eq:eq:sigma-Gr-EndId-def_pic} and \eqref{eq:smap-via-SC-phiM} we have 
\be\label{eq:b-from-S1Q}
  \mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_\one) = \id = b_Q^{-1} \phi_Q + (\text{terms that vanish when evaluated on $Q$}) \ .
\ee
Thus one can expect all the data on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:M-via-S} to be relatively accessible for a vertex operator algebra $V$ (as compared to computing fusion of $V$-modules). We will see an example of this in Section~\ref{sec:sf-example}.
\item
If $\Cc$ is semisimple, then Proposition~\ref{prop:M-via-S} is precisely the categorical Verlinde formula:
Firstly, $K_0(\Cc) = \Gr(\Cc)$, so that $M_{UV}^{~W}$ are the structure constants of $\Gr(\Cc)$. 
Next, by \cite[Rem.\,3.10\,(3)]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz} we have
$\mathscr{S}_\Cc(\phi_U) = (\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc)^{-\frac12}
 \sum_{X \in \Irr(\Cc)} 
s_{U^*,X}\, \phi_X$, where $\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc = \sum_{X \in \Irr(\Cc)} \dim(X)^2$ and $s_{A,B} \,\id_\one = \mathrm{tr}(c_{B,A} \circ c_{A,B})$. Thus $\tilde S_{AB} = s_{A^*,B} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc}$. Finally, $\tilde B_{AB} = \delta_{A,B}$, $\tilde C_{AB} = \delta_{A,B^*}$ and from \eqref{eq:b-from-S1Q} we see $b_Q= s_{\one,Q} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc}$. Altogether,
\eqref{eq:M-via-S} becomes (using $s_{X,Y} = s_{Y,X} = s_{X^*,Y^*}$)
\be
M_{UV}^{~W} 
~=~ \frac{1}{\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc}
\sum_{Q \in \mathrm{Irr}(\Cc)} 
\frac{s_{U^*,Q}\,  s_{V^*,Q} \,  
	s_{Q,W}
}{s_{\one,Q}}
~=~ \frac{1}{\mathrm{Dim}\,\Cc}
\sum_{Q \in \mathrm{Irr}(\Cc)} 
\frac{s_{U,Q}\,  s_{V,Q} \,  s_{W^*,Q}}{\dim(Q)} \ ,
\ee
	where $M_{UV}^{~W}$ is considered as an element of $k$. This is the semisimple categorical Verlinde formula, see \cite[Thm.\,4.5.2]{tur}.

\item A variant of the fusion algebra of projective characters was studied~\cite[Cor.\,4.4]{Lachowska-Verlinde} in the context of the small quantum groups for  simply laced simple Lie algebras. For  factorisable ribbon Hopf algebras, a Verlinde-like formula for the action of the Grothendieck ring on the Higman ideal is given in~\cite[Thm.\,3.14]{Cohen:2008}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}



It is an interesting problem to relate the modified trace on ``open Hopf links'' and properties of the modular $S$-transformation \cite{Creutzig:2016fms}. The above results allow us to do this in the case the open Hopf link is coloured by
 projective objects:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mod-tr-S}
For all $A \in J$, $X \in \Irr(\Cc)$ and
 $Q \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)$ we have
\be\label{eq:mod-tr-S}
\frac{t_{P_X}\bigl(\sigma([P_A])_{P_X}\bigr)}{t_Q(\id_Q)} ~=~ b_Q \sum_{B\in J} \tilde S_{AB} \, 
	\widehat\CM_{BX} \ .
\ee
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Apply $t_{P_X}(\cdots)$ to both sides of \eqref{eq:tildeS-in-basis-def}, expand $\phi_{P_B}$ as $\phi_{P_B} = \sum_{W \in \Irr(\Cc)} [P_B:W] \phi_W$ and use \eqref{eq:mod-trace-on-phiA} and \eqref{eq:tP1phiP1-via-tQidQ}.
\end{proof}


In particular, for $X=Q\in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)$ we have
\be\label{eq:modtr-modS-simpleproj}
\frac{t_{X}(	\sigma([P_A])_{X}
)}{t_X(\sigma([\one])_X)} ~=~ \frac{\tilde S_{AX}}{ b_X^{-1}}   \ .
\ee
Moreover, by Lemma~\ref{lem:exchange-partial-trace} we have $t_{P_B}(\sigma([P_A])_{P_B}) = t_{P_A^*}(\sigma([P_B^*])_{P_A^*})$, so that \eqref{eq:mod-tr-S} implies that for $A,B \in J$,
\be
	\big(\tilde S \cdot \widehat\CM \big)_{AB}
	~=~
	\big(\tilde S \cdot \widehat\CM \big)_{B^*A^*} \ ,
\ee
where by abuse of notation we restrict 
	$\widehat\CM$ 
to be a $J \times J$-matrix.

\begin{remark}
Equation \eqref{eq:modtr-modS-simpleproj} is a special case of a relation observed in the example of $W_p$-models in \cite[Sec.\,3.3]{Creutzig:2016fms}. The notation used there is related to ours as $S^{\circ\!\!\circ;\mathcal{P}}_{M,P} = t_P(\sigma([M])_P)$, where $M \in \Cc$, $P \in \Proj(\Cc)$.
In \cite{Creutzig:2016fms}, the matrix of the modular $S$-transformation of pseudo-trace functions in some basis is denoted by $S^\chi$. 
Using these notations,
\eqref{eq:modtr-modS-simpleproj} reads $S^{\circ\!\!\circ;\mathcal{P}}_{P_A,X} / S^{\circ\!\!\circ;\mathcal{P}}_{\one,X} = S^\chi_{P_A,X} / S^\chi_{\one,X}$ for $A \in \Irr(\Cc)$, $X \in \mathrm{IrrProj}(\Cc)$ (assuming the conjectures in 
\cite[Sec.\,5]{Gainutdinov:2016qhz} 
so that we can express
$\tilde S_{AX}$ and $b_X^{-1}$ in terms of modular properties of pseudo-trace functions).
\end{remark}


\section{Example: symplectic fermions}\label{sec:sf-example}

In this section we consider a family of examples of 
factorisable finite ribbon categories, namely the so-called symplectic fermion 
categories $\SF(\h,\beta)$. The aim is to compute the modified trace for this class of examples
 and to illustrate the use of Proposition~\ref{prop:M-via-S}.

\medskip

Let $\h$ be a non-zero finite-dimensional symplectic vector space over $\Cb$ and let $\beta \in \Cb$ satisfy $\beta^4 = i^{\dim\h}$. The $\Cb$-linear finite ribbon category $\SF(\h,\beta)$ was introduced in \cite{Davydov:2012xg,Runkel:2012cf}. Conjecturally, it is ribbon-equivalent to the representations of the even part of the symplectic fermion vertex operator super-algebra constructed from $\h$ (hence the name), see \cite[Conj.\,7.3]{Davydov:2016euo} for the precise statement and further references.

One can show that $\SF(\h,\beta)$ is ribbon-equivalent to a certain finite-dimensional quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebra \cite{Gainutdinov:2015lja,FGRprep2}, but we will not make
use of this here.
Instead we sketch the construction in \cite{Davydov:2012xg}. We refer to \cite[Sec.\,5.2]{Davydov:2012xg} or to e.g.\ \cite{Davydov:2013ty,FGRprep2} 
for further details.


\medskip
\newcommand{\algS}{\mathbb{\Lambda}}

Denote the symmetric tensor category of finite-dimensional complex super-vector spaces  by $\sVect$. 
We define
\be
\algS = \Lambda(\h) \ ,
\ee 
the exterior algebra of $\h$, and consider it as an algebra in $\sVect$ by taking the $\Zb$-grading of $\Lambda(\h)$ modulo 2.
In particular, $\dim(\algS) = 2^{\dim\h}$ and $\mathrm{sdim}(\algS)=0$, 
where $\mathrm{sdim}(-)$ denotes the super-dimension. $\algS$ carries the structure of a 
	commutative and cocommutative
quasi-triangular Hopf algebra in $\sVect$.
 We denote the  multiplication, comultiplication, unit and counit by 
$\mu_\algS$, $\Delta_\algS$, $\eta_\algS$, and $\eps_\algS$, respectively
(see \cite[Eqn.\,(5.4)]{Davydov:2012xg} for the coalgebra structure).
 
We will make use of a specific cointegral $\coint_\algS : \algS \to \Cb$ for $\algS$
(see \cite[Eqn.\,(5.16)]{Davydov:2012xg}). 
To describe it, let $d = \dim\h$ and $a_1,\dots,a_d$ be a symplectic basis of $\h$ such that $(a_1,a_2)=1$, $(a_3,a_4)=1$, etc. Then $\coint_\algS$ is non-zero only on the top component of $\algS$, where it takes the value
\be
	\coint_\algS(a_1a_2\cdots a_d) ~=~ \beta^{-2} \ .
\ee

The category $\SF(\h,\beta)$ is the direct sum of two
full subcategories,
\be
	\SF(\h,\beta) ~=~
	\SF_0 ~\oplus~ \SF_1 
	\quad , \qquad
	\SF_0 = \Rep_{\sVect}(\algS)
	~~,~~
	\SF_1 = \sVect \ ,
\ee
where $\Rep_{\sVect}(\algS)$ denotes the category of left $\algS$-modules in $\sVect$. 
$\SF_0$ and $\SF_1$ each contains two simple objects (up to isomorphism), which we denote as
\be\label{eq:proj-covers-SF}
	\underbrace{\one = \Cb^{1|0}~,~
	\Pi\one = \Cb^{0|1}}_{\in\SF_0}
	\quad , \quad
	\underbrace{T = \Cb^{1|0}~,~
	\Pi T = \Cb^{0|1}}_{\in\SF_1} \ .
\ee
Here, $\Pi$ is the parity-flip functor. The $\algS$-action on $\one$ and $\Pi\one$ is trivial.

Since $\SF_1$ is semi-simple, $T$ and $\Pi T$ are also projective. The projective cover of $\one$ is $\algS$ itself, with $\pi_\one : \algS \to \one$ being the projection on the top component of $\algS$ (together with a choice of isomorphism to $\Cb^{1|0}$). Altogether, the projective covers are
\be\label{eq:SF-proj-cov}
	P_\one = \algS
	~~,\quad
	P_{\Pi\one} = \Pi \algS
	~~,\quad
	P_T = T
	~~,\quad
	P_{\Pi T} = \Pi T \ .
\ee
In particular, the Cartan matrix in \eqref{eq:composition-series-proj-cover} reads, in the ordering \eqref{eq:proj-covers-SF} of simple objects,
\be
	\CM(\SF(\h,\beta)) ~=~
	\begin{pmatrix}
	2^{2N-1} & 2^{2N-1} & 0 & 0  \\
	2^{2N-1} & 2^{2N-1} & 0 & 0  \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
	\qquad , \quad
	\text{where} \quad
	N = \tfrac12 \dim\h \ . 
\ee


We write 
$* : \SF(\h) \times \SF(\h) \to \SF(\h)$ 
for the tensor product functor and will reserve the notation $\otimes$ for the tensor product in $\sVect$ and for that of $\algS$-modules in $\sVect$. 
The tensor product $*$ is $\Zb_2$-graded, and depending on which sector $X,Y \in \SF(\h)$ are chosen from, it is defined to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:*-tensor}
X \ast Y ~=~
\left\{\rule{0pt}{2.8em}\right.
\hspace{-.5em}\raisebox{.7em}{
\begin{tabular}{ccll}
   $X$ & $Y$ & $X \ast Y$ &
\\
$0$ & $0$ & $X \otimes Y$ & $\in~\SF_0$
\\
 $0$ & $1$ & $X \otimes Y$ & $\in~\SF_1$
\\
 $1$ & $0$ & $X \otimes Y$ & $\in~\SF_1$
\\
$1$ & $1$ & $\algS \otimes X \otimes Y$ & $\in~\SF_0$
\end{tabular}}
\end{equation}
In sector $00$, the tensor product is that of $\Rep_{\sVect}(\algS)$, with $\algS$-action given by the coproduct (and using the symmetric braiding of $\sVect$).
In sectors $01$ and $10$,  the tensor product is that of the underlying super-vector spaces.
 In sector $11$, the $\algS$-action is given by the left regular action on $\algS$.

We refer to \cite{Davydov:2012xg,FGRprep2} for the associator and braiding isomorphisms in $\SF(\h,\beta)$, as well as for the ribbon twist and for the rigid and the pivotal structures. The $\beta$-dependence enters into these structure maps. We have:

\begin{proposition}[{\cite{Davydov:2012xg,FGRprep2}}]
$\SF(\h,\beta)$ is factorisable.
\end{proposition}

The embedding $\sVect \hookrightarrow \SF_0$, $X \mapsto X$, where $X$ is endowed with the trivial $\algS$-action, is an embedding of ribbon categories. Every projective object in $\SF(\h,\beta)$ is isomorphic to $\algS * X \oplus T * Y$ for some $X,Y \in \sVect$, embedded in $\SF_0$. Note that by definition,
\be
	\End_{\SF}(\algS*X) = \End_{\sVect,\algS}(\algS \otimes X) \quad , \quad
	\End_{\SF}(T*X) = \End_{\sVect}(X) \ ,
\ee
where $\End_{\sVect,\algS}(\algS \otimes X)$ are all even endomorphisms of the super-vector space $\algS \otimes X$ which commute with the $\algS$-action and $\End_{\sVect}(X)$ are all even endomorphisms of the super-vector space $X$.
Write $\mathrm{str}(-)$ for the super-trace.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:SF-modified-tr}
Let $X$ be a finite-dimensional super-vector space
and $f \in \End_{\SF}(\algS * X)$, $g \in \End_{\SF}(T * X)$. Then, for each $t_0 \in \Cb^\times$,
\be\label{eq:SF-modified-tr}
	t_{\algS*X}(f) = t_0 \, \mathrm{str}\big( (\coint_\algS \otimes \id) \circ f \circ (\eta_\algS \otimes \id)\,\big)
	\quad , \quad
	t_{T*X}(g) = t_0 \, \mathrm{str}(g)
\ee
defines a modified trace on $\Proj(\SF(\h,\beta))$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The proof makes use of the explicit associator and rigid structure of $\SF(\h,\beta)$. Since we only need them for this proof, we prefer to refer to 
	\cite{Davydov:2012xg,FGRprep2} 
for the explicit formulas, rather than repeat them here.
We  use the simple projective 
	object
$Q=T$ to start with as in~\eqref{eq:tQ-choice} and set 
$t_T(\id_T) = t_0$.

To compute $t_{\algS*X}(f)$, we note that by~\eqref{eq:*-tensor}, $\algS=T*T^*$ and that the associator $\alpha_{T,T^*,X}: T*(T^**X) \to (T*T^*)*X$ is the identity map for the trivial $\algS$-module $X$. 
Here, the dual $T^*$ is as in $\sVect$.
We define $\tilde f \in \End_{\SF}(T*(T^**X))$ as
\be

  \quad .
\ee
Here, the boxes indicate in which category the string diagram is to be evaluated. In particular, the right hand side is given in $\sVect$ and  the crossings are the flips of super-vector spaces.
	We can now write
\be\label{eq:tSX-1}
	t_{\algS* X}(f) ~=~  
	t_{T*(T^* * X)}(\tilde f)
	~=~
	t_T(F)

     \setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}

  \raisebox{80pt}{\framebox{$\SF$}}
  }
\quad .
\ee
In the last equality we used the partial trace property~\eqref{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace},
	and we implicitly used that $\alpha_{T,T^*,X}$ is the identity map.
Next we write out $F$
in terms of the structure morphisms (recall that we omit the tensor product `\,$*$\,' between objects for better readability):
\begin{align}
F &~=~ \big[\,
T \xrightarrow{\sim} T\one
\xrightarrow{\id\otimes\coev_{T^*  X}}
T((T^*X)(T^* X)^*)
\xrightarrow{\alpha^{-1}\circ (\tilde f * \id) \circ \alpha }
T((T^*X)(T^* X)^*)
\nonumber\\
& \hspace{6em}
\xrightarrow{\id \otimes \widetilde\ev_{T^*X}}
T\one
\xrightarrow{\sim}
T
\,\big] \ ,
\label{eq:SF-modified-tr_aux1}
\end{align}
where $\alpha^{-1}\circ (\tilde f * \id)\circ \alpha$ stands for the composition $\alpha^{-1}_{T,T^*X,(T^* X)^*}\circ (\tilde f * \id)\circ \alpha_{T,T^*X,(T^* X)^*}$.
Finally, we compute $F$
using the explicit associator in the 111-sector (see \cite[Eqn.\,(2.27)]{Davydov:2012xg})
  and the duality maps from
  \cite[Eqns.\,(3.59), (4.77), (4.78)]{Davydov:2012xg}:

where, $\phi_\algS\colon \algS \to \algS$ appears in the associator in the 111-sector. In the equality (*) we used the identities
$\eps_\algS \circ \phi_\algS^{-1} = \coint_\algS$ 
and 
$\phi_\algS \circ \coint_\algS = \eta_\algS$
(for the first identity, use \cite[Eqns.\,(3.45), (2.29)]{Davydov:2012xg} and the fact that in the present case the distinguished group-like element $g$ of \cite{Davydov:2012xg} is just $\eta_\algS$, for the second identity use \cite[Eqns.\,(4.84), (3.45)]{Davydov:2012xg}).
Altogether, $t_{\algS* X}(f) = t_T(F)$ gives
the expression in~\eqref{eq:SF-modified-tr}.

The computation of $t_{T*X}(g)$ also uses the partial trace property~\eqref{eq:mod-tr_partial-trace}: $t_{T*X}(g) = t_T(tr^r_X(g)) =  t_0 \, \mathrm{str}(g)$.
\end{proof}


Let us evaluate the modified trace from Proposition~\ref{prop:SF-modified-tr} for the four indecomposable projectives in \eqref{eq:proj-covers-SF}. Note that all (left) $\algS$-module maps $\algS \to \algS$ in $\sVect$ are given by right multiplication $R_a$ with an even element $a\in \algS$. The same holds for $\algS$-module maps $\Pi \algS \to \Pi \algS$.
\be
	t_{\algS}(R_a) = t_0\,\coint_\algS(a) 
	~~,\quad
	t_{\Pi \algS}(R_a) = -t_0\,\coint_\algS(a) 
	~~,\quad
	t_T(\id_T) = t_0
	~~,\quad
	t_{\Pi T}(\id_{\Pi T}) = -t_0
	\ . 
\ee

After the computation of the modified trace, we now turn to an application of Proposition~\ref{prop:M-via-S}. Recall that $\Irr(\SF(\h,\beta)) = \{ \one, \Pi\one,T,\Pi T\}$. From \eqref{eq:SF-proj-cov} one sees that $[P_\one] = [P_{\Pi\one}]$, so that we can choose $J = \{ \one,T,\Pi T\}$. 
For the matrices $\tilde B$, $\tilde S$ and $\tilde C$ from \eqref{eq:tildeB-expansion}--\eqref{eq:tildeC-def} one finds, for the above order of basis vectors,
\be\label{eq:SF-proj-verlinde-data}
\tilde B
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
\quad , \quad
\tilde S
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 2^{N-1} & -2^{N-1} \\[.3em]
2^N & \tfrac12 & \tfrac12 \\[.3em]
-2^N & \tfrac12 & \tfrac12 
\end{pmatrix}
\quad , \quad
\tilde C
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
\quad , \quad
\ee
where $\tilde S$ has been computed in \cite{FGRprep2} (for $\beta=\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} N\pi/4}$). 
The constants $b_Q$ are (using again the $S$-action from \cite{FGRprep2} and \eqref{eq:b-from-S1Q})
\be
	b_T = 2^{-N-1} \quad,\quad
	b_{\Pi T} = -2^{-N-1}  \ .
\ee


\begin{remark}
~\\[-1.5em]
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item
The matrix $\tilde S$ can be read off directly from the modular 
$S$-transformation of characters for projective modules of the even part of the symplectic fermion vertex operator algebra (see \cite{Kausch:1995py,Gaberdiel:1996np,Abe:2005} and e.g.\ \cite[Sec.\,2.1]{Davydov:2016euo} for the modular properties of the characters of simple modules).
\item
Using Proposition~\ref{prop:mod-tr-S}, $\tilde S$ can be used to compute the modified trace of open Hopf link operators for projective objects. For example, \eqref{eq:mod-tr-S} with 
$A=Q=T$, $X=\one$ gives
\be
t_0^{-1} \, t_{P_\one}\big( \sigma([T])_{P_\one} \big)
~=~
b_T
\sum_{B \in J} \tilde S_{TB} \, \CM(\SF)_{B\one}
~=~ 2^{-N-1} \cdot 2^N \cdot 2^{2N-1} ~=~ 4^{N-1} \ .
\ee
\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Starting from the data in \eqref{eq:SF-proj-verlinde-data},
Equation \eqref{eq:M-via-S} allows one to compute, for all $U,V \in \Irr(\SF(\h,\beta))$,
\be
	M_{UV}^{~\one} + M_{UV}^{~\Pi\one}
	~~,\quad
	M_{UV}^{~T}
	~~,\quad
	M_{UV}^{~\Pi T} \ .
\ee 
Because $\tilde B$ is degenerate, we only obtain the sum $M_{UV}^{~\one} + M_{UV}^{~\Pi\one}$. However, in the present case we can do better. 
Namely, for finite tensor categories we have
\be
	M_{UV}^{~\one}
	= \dim_k\Cc(P_U \otimes P_V,\one)
	= \dim_k\Cc(P_U,P_V^*)
	= [P_V^*:U] \overset{\eqref{eq:cartan-mat-def}}= 
	\CM(\SF(\h,\beta))_{V^*U} \ .
\ee
So in the present example, knowledge of the composition series of the $P_U$ together with the data \eqref{eq:SF-proj-verlinde-data} actually fixes $M_{UV}^{~W}$ completely.

\section{Proofs of Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr} and Corollary~\ref{cor:dinat-jac-0}}\label{app:dinat-exact}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr}]
Consider the product complex
\be
\xymatrix{
& 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] & 0 \ar[d] &
\\
0 \ar[r] & {}^*C \otimes A \ar[r]^{\id \otimes f} \ar[d]^{{}^*\!g \otimes \id} & {}^*C \otimes B \ar[r]^{\id \otimes g} \ar[d]^{{}^*\!g \otimes \id} & {}^*C \otimes C \ar[r] \ar[d]^{{}^*\!g \otimes \id} & 0
\\
0 \ar[r] & {}^*B \otimes A \ar[r]^{\id \otimes f} \ar[d]^{{}^*\!f \otimes \id} & {}^*B \otimes B \ar[r]^{\id \otimes g} \ar[d]^{{}^*\!f \otimes \id} & {}^*B \otimes C \ar[r] \ar[d]^{{}^*\!f \otimes \id} & 0
\\
0 \ar[r] & {}^*\!A \otimes A \ar[r]^{\id \otimes f} \ar[d] & {}^*\!A \otimes B \ar[r]^{\id \otimes g} \ar[d] & {}^*\!A \otimes C \ar[r] \ar[d] & 0
\\
& 0 & 0 & 0 &
 }
\ee
Since the tensor product functor is biexact by assumption, this complex has exact rows and columns.

Let $K \xrightarrow{\kappa} {}^*B \otimes B$ be the kernel of ${}^*\!f \otimes g$.
It is shown in the proof of \cite[Lem.\,2.5.1]{Geer:2010} that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the morphism 
$(\id \otimes f) \circ \pi_1 + ({}^*\!g \otimes \id) \circ \pi_2 : 
{}^*B \otimes A \,\oplus\, {}^*C \otimes B \to {}^*B \otimes B$, where $\pi_{1,2}$ are the projections on the first and second direct summand, factors through $K$ as $\kappa \circ u$ with $u : {}^*B \otimes A \,\oplus\, {}^*C \otimes B \to K$ surjective.
\item
there are (necessarily unique) morphisms
$\alpha : K \to {}^*\!A \otimes A$ and $\gamma : K \to {}^*C \otimes C$ such that
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_aux1}
	(\id \otimes f) \circ \alpha ~=~ ({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \kappa
	\quad , \quad
	({}^*\!g \otimes \id) \circ \gamma ~=~ (\id \otimes g) \circ \kappa \ .	
\ee
\end{enumerate}
Write $\hat b := (\id_{{}^*\!B} \otimes b) \circ \widetilde\coev_B$. Note that
\be
	({}^*\!f \otimes g) \circ \hat b
	~=~ (\id \otimes (g \circ b \circ f)) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
	~=~ 0 \ ,
\ee
where in the last step we used the commuting diagram \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_diag}. Thus $\hat b : \one \to {}^*B \otimes B$ factors through $K$, 
$\hat b = \big[ \one \xrightarrow{\tilde b} K \xrightarrow{\kappa} {}^*B \otimes B \big]$. We have
\begin{align}
	& (id \otimes f) \circ \alpha \circ \tilde b
	\overset{\eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux1}}= 
	({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \kappa \circ \tilde b
	= 
	({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ (\id \otimes b) \circ \widetilde\coev_B
	\nonumber \\
	&=
	(\id \otimes (b\circ f)) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
	\overset{\eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_diag}}= 
	(id \otimes f) \circ (\id \otimes a) \circ \widetilde\coev_A \ .
\end{align}
Since $id \otimes f$ is injective, we get $\alpha \circ \tilde b = (\id \otimes a) \circ \widetilde\coev_A$. Along similar lines 
	-- using injectivity of ${}^*\!g \otimes \id$ --
one shows that $\gamma \circ \tilde b = (\id \otimes c) \circ \widetilde\coev_C$.
Define the morphism $\Gamma :\one \to X$ as
\be
	\Gamma ~:=~ \eta_A \circ \alpha \circ \tilde b ~+~ \eta_C \circ \gamma \circ \tilde b \ .
\ee
By the above calculation we see that $\Gamma$ is equal to the right hand side of \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_rel}. To see that $\Gamma$ it also equal to the left hand side of \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_rel}, we make use of the surjection $p : P \to \one$, where $P \in \Mc$ is projective. We will now show that $\Gamma \circ p = \eta_B \circ \hat b \circ p$, which completes the proof.

Since by point 1 above, $u: {}^*B \otimes A \,\oplus\, {}^*C \otimes B \to K$ is surjective (and since $P$ is projective), we can find $s$ such that the left square in the following commuting diagram commutes:
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_aux2}
\xymatrix{
P \ar[rr]^s \ar[d]^p && {}^*B \otimes A \,\oplus\, {}^*C \otimes B \ar[dl]^u \ar[d]^{(\id \otimes f) \circ \pi_1 + ({}^*\!g \otimes \id) \circ \pi_2}
\\
\one \ar[r]^{\tilde b} \ar@/_1pc/[rr]_{\hat b} & K \ar[r]^\kappa & {}^*B \otimes B
}
\ee
Now compute
\begin{align}
	(\id \otimes f) \circ \alpha \circ \tilde b \circ p
	&\underset{\eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux2}}{\overset{\eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux1}}=}
	({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \kappa \circ u \circ s
	\overset{\text{(*)}}=
	({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ (id \otimes f) \circ \pi_1 \circ s
	\nonumber\\
	&=
	(id \otimes f) \circ ({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \pi_1 \circ s \ ,
\end{align}
where in (*) we used the commuting diagram \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux2} and the fact that ${}^*f \circ {}^*g = 0$. Since $id \otimes f$ is injective, we can conclude that $\alpha \circ \tilde b \circ p = ({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \pi_1 \circ s$. Hence
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_aux3}
	\eta_A \circ \alpha \circ \tilde b \circ p
	~=~ \eta_A \circ ({}^*\!f \otimes \id) \circ \pi_1 \circ s
	\overset{\text{dinat.}}= \eta_B \circ (\id \otimes f) \circ \pi_1 \circ s \ .
\ee
Similarly one can show $\gamma \circ \tilde b \circ p = (\id \otimes g) \circ \pi_2 \circ s$ and
\be\label{eq:dinat-Gr_aux4}
	\eta_C \circ \gamma \circ \tilde b \circ p
	~=~ \eta_B \circ ({}^*g \otimes \id) \circ \pi_2 \circ s \ .
\ee
Combining \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux3} and \eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux4} we finally find
\be
	\Gamma \circ p
	~=~
	\eta_B \circ (\id \otimes f) \circ \pi_1 \circ s
	+
	\eta_B \circ ({}^*g \otimes \id) \circ \pi_2 \circ s
	\overset{\eqref{eq:dinat-Gr_aux2}}=
	\eta_B \circ \hat b \circ p \ .
\ee
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:dinat-jac-0}]
The proof of Part 1 follows that of \cite[Cor.\,2.5.2]{Geer:2010}.
	We give the details for the first equality, the second one is shown analogously using Remark~\ref{rem:all-endo-are-id}\,(1).

Let $A = \bigoplus_m A_m$ be a decomposition of $A$ into indecomposable objects $A_m \in \Cc$, and write 
	$j_m : A_m \to A$ 
and $p_m : A \to A_m$ for the corresponding embedding and projection maps. 
Writing $\id_A = \sum_m j_m \circ p_m$ and applying dinaturality of $\eta$ to $j_m$, we have
\begin{align}
\eta_A \circ (\id \otimes f) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
&~=~
\sum_m \eta_A \circ (\id \otimes (j_m \circ p_m \circ f)) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
\nonumber \\
&~=~
\sum_m \eta_{A_m} \circ (\id \otimes (p_m \circ f \circ j_m)) \circ \widetilde\coev_{A_m} \ .
\end{align}
Now for all simple $U \in \Cc$ and $u : A_m \to U$ we have $u \circ p_m \circ f \circ j_m = 0$ by assumption on $f$ (as $u \circ p_m : A \to U$). It is therefore enough to prove the corollary for indecomposable $A$. 

Let $A$ be indecomposable. By Fitting's Lemma, every element of $\End(A)$ is either invertible or nilpotent. By assumption, $f$ cannot be invertible, hence it is nilpotent, say $f^n = 0$. Let $K = \ker(f)$ and consider the commutative diagram
\be
\xymatrix{
 0 \ar[r] & K \ar[r]^\kappa \ar[d]^0 & A \ar[r]^\gamma \ar[d]^f & C \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[d]^{\exists!\,c} & 0
\\
 0 \ar[r] & K \ar[r]^\kappa & A \ar[r]^\gamma & C \ar[r] & 0
 }
\ee
with exact rows,
i.e.\ $(C,\gamma)$ 
is the cokernel of the kernel of $f$ aka.\ the image of $f$.
	The map~$c$ exists and is unique by the universal property of the cokernel.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:dinat-Gr} we have
\be\label{eq:induction-step-aux}
\eta_A \circ (\id \otimes f) \circ \widetilde\coev_A
~=~
0 + 	\eta_C \circ (\id \otimes c) \circ \widetilde\coev_C \ .
\ee

We proceed by induction on the degree $n$ of nilpotency. For $n=1$ the claim of part 1 of the corollary is clear. Suppose now the claim holds for all maps whose degree of nilpotency is less or equal to $n-1$.
Since $f \circ f^{n-1} = 0$, there is 
$h : A \to K$ such that $f^{n-1} = \kappa \circ h$. But then 
$c^{n-1} \circ \gamma = 
\gamma \circ f^{n-1} = \gamma \circ \kappa \circ h = 0$, and since $\gamma$ is surjective, $c^{n-1} = 0$. 
By our induction assumption, \eqref{eq:induction-step-aux} is zero.

\smallskip

For part 2, consider the dinatural transformation $\xi$ from  $(-) \otimes (-)^*$ to $B^* \otimes B$ with
\be
	\xi_A ~=~ 
	\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\setlength{\unitlength}{.75pt}
  \begin{picture}(76,135)
   \put(0,0){\scalebox{.75}{\includegraphics{pics/pic16.pdf}}}
   \put(0,0){
     \put(0,0){
     \put (40,0) {\scriptsize$ A $}
     \put (67,0) {\scriptsize$ A^* $}
     \put (4,128) {\scriptsize$ B^* $}
     \put (30,128) {\scriptsize$ B $}
     }\setlength{\unitlength}{1pt}}
  \end{picture}}
  \qquad .
\ee
To obtain \eqref{eq:f-loop-zero}, set $H := \xi_A \circ (f \otimes \id_{A^*}) \circ \coev_A$ and
use the second equality in part 1 to see $H=0$.
Then 
use $\widetilde\ev_B$ to turn $H : \one \to B^* \otimes B$ into an endomorphism of $B$, and after using the naturality of the braiding we get~\eqref{eq:f-loop-zero}.
\end{proof}

\section{Proofs of Lemma~\ref{lem:tau-R-welldef} and Proposition~\ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod}}\label{app:ReyHigideal}


For this appendix, we fix
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Ac$: a finite abelian category over	$k$,
\item $G$: a projective generator of $\Ac$,
\item $E = \End(G)$ the $k$-algebra of endomorphisms of $G$.
\end{itemize}


Write $\Id_{\Proj(\Ac)}$ for the identity functor on the projective ideal of $\Ac$, and $\End(\Id_{\Proj(\Ac)})$ for
the algebra of
 its natural endomorphisms.
The following lemma is standard.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:nat-end-via-proj}
The map $\End(\Id_\Ac) \to \End(\Id_{\Proj(\Ac)})$, $\eta\mapsto\eta\raisebox{-.3em}{$|_{\Proj(\Ac)}$}$ 
is a $k$-algebra isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\eta \in \End(\Id_\Ac)$ is zero iff its values on all projective objects are zero,
 the map is injective. For surjectivity, let $A \in \Ac$ and pick an exact sequence $Q \xrightarrow{x} P \xrightarrow{y} A \to 0$ with $P,Q \in \Proj(\Ac)$. Consider the diagram
\be
\xymatrix{
Q \ar[r]^x \ar[d]^{\eta_Q} & P \ar[r]^y \ar[d]^{\eta_P} & A \ar[r] \ar@{-->}[d]^{\exists!\eta_A} & 0
\\
Q \ar[r]^x  & P \ar[r]^y & A \ar[r] & 0
}
\ee 
The left square commutes by naturality of $\eta$ on projectives. 
The dashed morphism $\eta_A$ exists by the universal property of the cokernel $(A,y)$ of $x : Q \to P$. 
It is straightforward to verify that $\eta_A$ is independent of the choice of $P,Q,x,y$ and that the family $\{\eta_A\}_{A \in \Ac}$ is a 
 natural endomorphism of $\Id_\Ac$ extending $\eta$ from $\Proj(\Ac)$ to all of $\Ac$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:tau-R-welldef}]
Let $y \in \End(R)$ and 
define the family $(\eta_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$ as in \eqref{eq:tau_R-defn}:
\be
	\eta_P := \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \circ y \circ \gamma_{PR}'' \ .
\ee
We will show that $\eta \in \End(\Id_{\Proj(\Ac)})$. The statement of the lemma then follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:nat-end-via-proj}.

Let $P,Q \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and $f : P\to Q$ be given. 
We need the following auxiliary result. Let $X$ and $Y$ in $\Ac(R,Q) \otimes \Ac(P,R)$ be defined as
\be\label{eq:tau-R-welldef-aux1}
	X = \sum_{(\gamma_{QR})} \gamma_{QR}' \otimes (\gamma_{QR}'' \circ f)
	\quad , \quad
	Y = \sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} (f \circ \gamma_{PR}') \otimes \gamma_{PR}''  \ .
\ee
Write $X = \sum_{(X)} X' \otimes X''$ and dito for $Y$.
Then for all $z : Q \to R$ we have
\begin{align}
\sum_{(X)} (z,X')_{QR} \, X''
&=
\sum_{(\gamma_{QR})}  (z, \gamma_{QR}')_{QR} \, \gamma_{QR}'' \circ f
\overset{\eqref{eq:coparing-gamma-properties}}=
z \circ f \ ,
\nonumber\\
\sum_{(Y)} (z,Y')_{QR} \, Y''
&=
\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} (z,f \circ \gamma_{PR}')_{QR} \, \gamma_{PR}''
\overset{\eqref{eq:paring-projective}}=
\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} (z \circ f , \gamma_{PR}')_{PR} \, \gamma_{PR}''
\overset{\eqref{eq:coparing-gamma-properties}}=
z \circ f \ .
\end{align}
By non-degeneracy of the pairings we obtain $X=Y$.
Using this identity, we get
\be
f \circ \eta_P = \sum_{(Y)} Y' \circ y \circ Y''
= \sum_{(X)} X' \circ y \circ X'' = \eta_Q \circ f \ ,
\ee
in other words, the family $(\eta_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$ is natural in $\Proj(\Ac)$.
\end{proof}

To prepare the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod}, we need some further properties of the maps $\tau_R$ in \eqref{eq:tau_R-defn}, and we need a  description of Calabi-Yau trace maps in terms of their restriction to indecomposable projectives.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:tau-and-splittings}
Let $R,S \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and let $a : S \to R$, $b: R \to S$. 
Then $\tau_R(a \circ b) = \tau_S(b \circ a)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By an argument similar to that showing $X=Y$ in \eqref{eq:tau-R-welldef-aux1} above, one obtains that for all $P,R,S \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and 
$b : R \to S$,
\be\label{eq:tau-and-splittings-aux1}
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \otimes (	b
	 \circ \gamma_{PR}'')
	~=~
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PS})} (\gamma_{PS}' \circ 
	b) \otimes \gamma_{PS}''  \ .
\ee
Then
\be
	\tau_R(a \circ b)_P
	\overset{\eqref{eq:tau_R-defn}}=
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PR})} \gamma_{PR}' \circ a \circ (b \circ \gamma_{PR}'')
	\overset{\eqref{eq:tau-and-splittings-aux1}}=
	\sum_{(\gamma_{PS})}
	 (\gamma_{PS}' \circ b) \circ a \circ \gamma_{PS}''
	\overset{\eqref{eq:tau_R-defn}}=
	\tau_S(b \circ a)_P \ ,
\ee
where we used~\eqref{eq:tau-and-splittings-aux1} with both sides composed with $a\otimes \id$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:HigA-from-projgen}
$\Hig(\Ac) = \mathrm{im}(\tau_G)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $R \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and $h \in \End(R)$ be given. Pick an $m>0$ such that there is a splitting $p : G^{\oplus m} \to R$, $i : R \to G^{\oplus m}$, $p \circ i = \id_R$. Let $p_j : G \to R$, $i_j : R \to G$ be the components maps, that is, $\id_R = \sum_{j=1}^m p_j \circ i_j$. Then
\be
	\tau_R(h)
	=
	\sum_{j=1}^m \tau_R(p_j \circ i_j \circ h)
	\overset{\text{Lem.\,\ref{lem:tau-and-splittings}}}=
	\sum_{j=1}^m \tau_G(i_j \circ h \circ p_j) \ .
\ee
Thus $\tau_R(h)$ equals the image of $\sum_{j=1}^m i_j \circ h \circ p_j \in \End(G)$ under $\tau_G$.
\end{proof}


For $T \in \prod_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} (\End(P_U)\to k)$ denote by $T_{U}$ the component of $T$ in $\End(P_U)\to k$. Write
\begin{align}\label{eq:Tc}
\Tc ~=~
\Big\{ T \in \hspace{-.5em}\prod_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} \hspace{-.5em} (\End(P_U)\to k) ~\Big|~
&\text{$T$ makes the full subcategory
 with}
\nonumber \\[-1.5em]
& \hspace{2em}
 \text{objects $P_U$, $U \in \Irr(\Ac)$, Calabi-Yau } \Big\} \ .
\end{align}
In other words, $T \in \Tc$ iff for all $V,W \in \Irr(\Ac)$, the pairings $(-,-)_{P_VP_W} : \Ac(P_V,P_W) \times \Ac(P_W,P_V) \to k$, $(f,g)_{P_VP_W} = T_W(f \circ g)$ are non-degenerate and symmetric in the sense that $(f,g)_{P_VP_W} = (g,f)_{P_WP_V}$.

	Recall the notation $\mathrm{CY}(\Proj(\Ac))$ for the set of trace maps $(\tCY_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$ which turn $\Proj(\Ac)$ into a Calabi-Yau category (Definition~\ref{def:CY-cat}). 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:CY-structures-vs-setT}
The map
\be\label{eq:CY-structures-vs-setT}
	\mathrm{CY}(\Proj(\Ac)) \to \Tc
	\quad , \quad
	(\tCY_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)} \mapsto (\tCY_{P_U})_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} 
\ee
is a $k$-linear isomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	~\\
	{\em Injectivity:}
Let $P \in \Proj(\Ac)$ be given. Write $P = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} P_U^{\oplus n_U}$ and let $j_{U\alpha} : P_U \to P$, 
$p_{U\alpha} : P \to P_U$, 
$U \in \Irr(\Ac)$ and $\alpha = 1,\dots,n_U$, be the embedding and projection maps of the individual summands. By cyclicity
and linearity of $\tCY_{P_U}$, we have the decomposition
\be\label{eq:CY-structures-vs-setT_aux1}
	\tCY_P(f)
	~= \sum_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} \sum_{\alpha=1}^{n_U}
	\tCY_{P_U}(p_{U\alpha} \circ f \circ j_{U\alpha}) \ ,
\ee
where we used $\sum_{U,\alpha} e_{U\alpha} = \id_P$ for the primitive idempotents $e_{U\alpha} =  j_{U\alpha} \circ p_{U\alpha}$.
Thus $(\tCY_P)_{P \in \Proj(\Ac)}$ is uniquely determined by the values $(\tCY_{P_U})_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)}$, showing that the map \eqref{eq:CY-structures-vs-setT} is injective.

\medskip
	
	\noindent
	{\em Surjectivity:}
Given $(\tCY_{P_U})_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} \in \Tc$, we can define all $\tCY_P$ via \eqref{eq:CY-structures-vs-setT_aux1}. One checks that $\tCY_P$ is independent of the choice of embedding and projection maps. It remains to verify that $\tCY_P$ is non-degenerate and symmetric. 
Let $P,Q \in \Proj(\Ac)$ and let $j_{U\alpha}, p_{U\alpha}$ be a realisation of $P$ as a direct sum of indecomposable projectives
as above,
 and $j_{U\alpha}', p_{U\alpha}'$ one of $Q$.
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\leftskip}{-1em}
\item {\em (Symmetry)} Let $f : P \to Q$, $g: Q \to P$. 
We compute
\begin{align}
	\tCY_Q(f \circ g)
	&~=~
	\sum_{U,V,\alpha,\beta}
		\tCY_{P_U}
	(p_{U\alpha}' \circ f \circ j_{V\beta} \circ p_{V\beta} \circ g \circ j_{U\alpha}') 
	\nonumber \\
	&\overset{\text{sym.}}=
	\sum_{U,V,\alpha,\beta}
	\tCY_{P_V}( p_{V\beta} \circ g \circ j_{U\alpha}' \circ p_{U\alpha}' \circ f \circ j_{V\beta}) 
	~=~
	\tCY_P(g \circ f) \ .
\end{align}
\item
{\em (Non-degeneracy)}  Let $f : P \to Q$ be non-zero.
Then there exist $U,V,\alpha,\beta$ such that $p'_{V\beta} \circ f \circ j_{U\alpha} \neq 0$. By non-degeneracy of the $\tCY_{P_U}$ there is $\tilde g : P_V \to P_U$ such that
\be
0 \neq \tCY_{P_V}(p'_{V\beta} \circ f \circ j_{U\alpha} \circ \tilde g)
\overset{\text{sym.}}=
\tCY_{Q}(f \circ j_{U\alpha} \circ \tilde g \circ p'_{V\beta})
\ee
Thus for $g = j_{U\alpha} \circ \tilde g \circ p'_{V\beta}$ we get $\tCY_Q(f \circ g) \neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
This shows that the map  \eqref{eq:CY-structures-vs-setT} is surjective.
\end{proof}



\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:HigA-HigAmod}]
Recall that $G$ denotes a choice of projective generator of $\Ac$ and $E = \End(G)$.
We will show the following statements, which are equivalent to points 1 and~2 in the proposition
	upon
setting $\Ac = \rmod{A}$ and $G=A_A$ as the right regular representation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $E$ admits a central form turning it into a symmetric algebra if and only if $\Proj(\Ac)$ admits a Calabi-Yau structure.
\item
If $E$ is symmetric, the map $\xi$ from \eqref{eq:EndId-ZE-iso} restricts to an isomorphism of algebras $\xi : \Hig(\Ac) \to \Hig(E)$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
{\em Part 1:} Clearly, if $\tCY \in \mathrm{CY}(\Proj(\Ac))$, then $\tCY_G : E \to k$ turns $E$ into a symmetric algebra
with the central form $\varepsilon = \tCY_G$.

Suppose conversely that $E$ is a symmetric algebra with respect to the central form $\eps : E \to k$. Write $G = \bigoplus_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} P_U^{\oplus n_U}$ and write $j_{U\alpha} : P_U \to G$, 
$p_{U\alpha} : G \to P_U$,
$\alpha = 1,\dots,n_U$, for the embedding and projection maps of the individual summands. For $U \in \Irr(\Ac)$ define
\be
	T_U : \End(P_U) \to k
	\quad , \quad
	f \mapsto \eps(j_{U1} \circ f \circ p_{U1}) \ ,
\ee
i.e.\ we only use the component with $\alpha=1$ for each summand.
We now claim that $(T_U)_{U \in \Irr(\Ac)} \in \Tc$
(recall the definition~\eqref{eq:Tc}). 
By Lemma~\ref{lem:CY-structures-vs-setT} this will prove part 1.

\smallskip

\noindent
{\em Non-degeneracy:} Let $f : P_U \to P_V$ be non-zero. We need to find $g: P_V \to P_U$ such that $T_V(f \circ g) \neq 0$. Since $f$ is non-zero, so is $j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1}$. By non-degeneracy of $\eps$, there is $\tilde g \in E$ such that $\eps(j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1} \circ \tilde g) \neq 0$. Set $g := p_{U1} \circ \tilde g \circ j_{V1}$ and compute
\begin{align}
	T_V(f \circ g)
	&~=~
	\eps(j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1} \circ \tilde g \circ j_{V1} \circ p_{V1})
	\nonumber \\
	&\overset{\text{cycl.}}=
	\eps(j_{V1} \circ p_{V1} \circ j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1} \circ \tilde g)
	\nonumber \\
	&~=~
	\eps(j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1} \circ \tilde g)
	~\neq~ 0 \ .
\end{align}

\noindent
{\em Symmetry:} Let $f : P_U \to P_V$, $g: P_V \to P_U$. We compute
\begin{align}
	T_V(f \circ g)
	&~=~
	\eps(j_{V1} \circ f \circ g \circ p_{V1})
	~=~
	\eps(j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1} \circ j_{U1} \circ g \circ p_{V1})
	\nonumber \\
	&\overset{\text{cycl.}}=
	\eps(j_{U1} \circ g \circ p_{V1} \circ j_{V1} \circ f \circ p_{U1})
	~=~
	\eps(j_{U1} \circ g \circ f \circ p_{U1})
	\nonumber \\
	&~=~ T_U(g \circ f) \ .
\end{align}

\smallskip

\noindent
{\em Part 2:}
By the assumption that $E$ is symmetric and by part 1, 
$\Proj(\Ac)$ 
is Calabi-Yau via some $\tCY\in \mathrm{CY}(\Proj(\Ac))$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:HigA-indep-tr} (and by a similar argument for $\Hig(E)$), neither $\Hig(\Ac)$ nor $\Hig(E)$ depend on the choice of traces. In particular, we may replace whatever central form $E$ was originally equipped with by $\tCY_G$.

In terms of the central form $\tCY_G$, the map $\tau : E \to Z(E)$ from \eqref{eq:tau-map-A-ZA-def} reads
\be\label{eq:HigA-HigAmod_aux1}
	\tau(f)
	=
	\sum_{(\gamma_{GG})} \gamma_{GG}' \circ f \circ \gamma_{GG}'' 
	\overset{\eqref{eq:tau_R-defn}}= 
	(\tau_G(f))_G\ .
\ee
Using this, we compute
\be
	\xi(\Hig(\Ac))
	\overset{\text{Cor.\,\ref{cor:HigA-from-projgen}}}=
	\xi(\tau_G(E))
	\overset{\eqref{eq:EndId-ZE-iso}}= 
	(\tau_G(E))_G
	\overset{\eqref{eq:HigA-HigAmod_aux1}}= 
	\tau(E)
	= \Hig(E) \ .
\ee
\end{proof}
