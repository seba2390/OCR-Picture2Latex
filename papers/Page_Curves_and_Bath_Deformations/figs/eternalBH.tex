\caption{On the left is the two-sided thermal configuration of (II) featuring both the $t = t_0$ radiation region $\mathcal{R}^L(t_0) \cup \mathcal{R}^R(t_0)$ and the island $\mathcal{I}$ which emerges at late times. The right figure is a sketch of the (eternal) Page curve depicting (renormalized) entanglement entropy versus time---initially the time-dependent no-island entropy $S_\varnothing$ is minimal, but it eventually exceeds the non-trivial island entropy $S_{\mathcal{I}}$. This curve can be obtained by computing (renormalized) areas in the (III) configuration.}
