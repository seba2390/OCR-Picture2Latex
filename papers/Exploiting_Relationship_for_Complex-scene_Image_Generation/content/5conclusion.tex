\section{Conclusion}
The relationship between objects significantly rectifies the localization of objects and even their appearances. Prior literature mainly focuses on fitting the single object appearance. Semantic interactions among objects were overlooked, which may result in inconsistent and chaotic results. In this paper, we proposed a new framework to generate complex-scene images %, in which \textit{Spatial Constraint Module}, \textit{Relation-guided Appearance Generator} and \textit{Scene Graph Discriminator} are introduced to
by exploring the importance of relationships among multiple objects in complex-scene image generation. Quantitative results, qualitative results, and user studies show our method's ability for reasonable layout generation and object interactions alignment.%, which helps improve the quality of the image generated from the scene graph.
