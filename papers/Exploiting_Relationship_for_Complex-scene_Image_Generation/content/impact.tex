Images are tiny visual samples of the grand physical world. The elementary particles that comprise our world first evolve and cluster into objects. Then appearance of objects are gradually shaped by the interactions between their counterparts. To model the natural clustering and interaction, we construct a generative model that strictly and structurally mimic the graph-like natural arrangement of our world. Our model builds a projection from symbolic graph space to the pixel space and we demonstrate how a small alternation in the object relationship can greatly affect the appearance of surrounding objects. In the future, we should research more on the neural design that can easily fit the data structure of pixels and encode more in the model visually commonsensical (relational) patterns. Overall, this paper has a positive impact on both industry and academia and enhance people's understanding of visual thinking.
