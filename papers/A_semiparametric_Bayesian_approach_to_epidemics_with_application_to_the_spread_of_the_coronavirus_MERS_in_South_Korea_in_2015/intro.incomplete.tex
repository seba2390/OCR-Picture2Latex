In practice,
complete observations of population contact networks and epidemics are rare.
While population-level data (e.g., counts of the total number of infected, recovered or deceased population members) may be disseminated by public health authorities and can be collected by scraping websites and other channels of communication,
collecting individual-level data (e.g., the contacts, exposure, infectious, and removal times of infected population members) requires substantial investments in terms of time and resources,
making it all but impossible to collect all relevant data.
We first discuss possible reasons for incomplete data in Section 5.1
and then stress the importance of collecting network data in Section 5.2.
