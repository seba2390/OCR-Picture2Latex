Summary. 

This paper proposes a flexible semiparametric Bayesian approach to deal with incomplete observations of stochastic processes governing the spread of infectious diseases. The developed methodology is applied to study spread of the coronavirus MERS in South Korea in 2015. After reading the paper, I have the following major concerns.

1. The number of population members N is assumed to be finite in Section 2.1. Would the proposed semiparametric Bayesian method be applicable to the case when N tends to infinity.
\ebq

Thank you for your question,
which touches important statistical issues.
We have addressed these issues in the revised submission by adding the following subsection to the introduction of the paper:
\vspace{-.4cm}
\bauthq
\subsubsection*{1.4 Goal: superpopulation inference for finite populations}
\input{goal.tex}\eauthq

\bbq
2. The degree parameters $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\dots$, $\theta_N$ are assumed to be generated by a Diricklet process prior. Are the proposed Bayesian estimates sensitive to the prior choice?
\ebq

Thank you for bringing up an important point.
The posterior is sensitive to the choice of prior,
but the Dirichlet process prior is not the primary issue:
While a Dirichlet process prior with concentration parameter $\alpha$ and base distribution $N(\mu,\, \sigma^2)$ does depend on the hyperparameters $\alpha$, $\mu$, and $\sigma^2$,
the hyperparameters $\alpha$, $\mu$, and $\sigma^2$ are not specified by investigators but are random and have hyperpriors.
In Section 6.3 of the revised submission,
we point out:
\bauthq
\input{hyperpriors.tex}
\eauthq
The primary issue is that the posterior is sensitive to the prior probabilities of who infected whom,
because the MERS data set does not contain direct observations of transmissions or contacts,
so the information on transmissions and contacts is limited to two sources of indirect observations:
\bi
\item The assessments of doctors of who infected whom,
which we use to specify the prior probabilities of who infected whom.
\item The observed infectious and removal times,
which reveal when infected population members were infectious and therefore help narrow down the possible sources of infections.
\ei
While the observed infectious and removal times help narrow down the possible sources of infections,
there may be many possible sources of infections left.
As a consequence,
it is not surprising that the posterior is sensitive to the choice of prior probabilities of who infected whom.

We demonstrate in Section 8.4 of the revised submission that posterior predictions of the epidemic are sensitive to the choice of prior probabilities of who infected whom:
\bauthq\input{ppc.epidemic}\eauthq

\vspace{-.4cm}

\bbq
3. It may be helpful if the authors can summarize how to implement the proposed semiparametric estimation method in practice (list the main steps) and discuss the computation burden. In particular, it would be interesting to explore how the increasing population number affects the computational time.
\ebq

In the revised submission,
we have added Section 6.4 to list the main steps of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and discuss its computing time in terms of the number of population members $N$:

Summary

In this manuscript, the authors consider the problem of modeling the spread of an infectious disease across a population contact network. In my mind, the paper seeks to make contributions on three main points: (1) proposing a semiparametric model, which can flexibly model the degree distribution of the population contact network (e.g., including more realistic long-tailed distributions), (2) defining what missing data looks like for models like these and when it is ignorable, and (3) highlighting the importance of sampling directly from the population contact network to improve estimation. The authors also examine an application of their proposed semiparametric model to infectious disease data from South Korea. The manuscript ends with a very nice discussion of areas for future work.
\ebq

Thank you very much for your careful reading of our paper.
We very much appreciate your efforts to understand our paper and provide us with constructive comments and suggestions for improving it.
We respond to your suggestions point-by-point.

\bbq
I think this paper is an important contribution to the discussion of how to best model the spread of an infectious disease on a network. The discussions of the shortcomings of non-network approaches and of existing network-based approaches (e.g., inability to model long-tailed degree distributions) is informative and important. However, I feel like the three main contributions of the paper (mentioned above) are somewhat muddled throughout the text (especially points 2 and 3); these very different topics should be more clearly differentiated in the text (and possibly in the abstract and/or introduction as well). In particular, the aspects of the simulation study and the application to the South Korea data that address each of these points should be made more clear in the manuscript. In some cases, this could be as simple as including more informative section headings (e.g., changing “Simulations” to “Quantifying the effect of population contact sampling” or something similar).
\ebq

These are great suggestions, 
thank you.
Inspired by your suggestions,
we have restructured the paper and revised the titles of the sections as follows:
\input{contents.tex}
We hope that these changes in the structure of the paper make the different contributions of the paper more visible.
In addition,
we have added a table of contents to the paper.

\setcounter{figure}{6}
\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{ppc.degrees}
MERS data: Posterior predictions of the degree distribution of the population contact network.}\s
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{degreedistribution.pdf}
\end{figure}

\bbq
Additionally, Section 5 needs to be fleshed out more and both Sections 5 and 6 need to be better connected to the previous theoretical results and discussions in the paper. For example, in Section 6, the main result meant to demonstrate how the semiparametric model outperforms the existing network models is the change in MSE (and the posterior predictions in Figure 3); however, the main theoretical argument is that the semiparametric model can better handle long-tailed degree distributions. Does the South Korea data have a long-tailed degree distribution? Perhaps this distribution could be plotted in Figure 4. Is there some way to summarize this difference across the models fit to the South Korea data - i.e., is it possible to look at something like posterior predictions for the degree distribution itself?
\ebq

We do not know whether the MERS data set has a long-tailed degree distribution,
because the contacts and hence the degrees of population members are unobserved.
That said,
it is possible to generate posterior predictions of the degree distribution of the population contact network,
provided draws from the posterior distribution are available.
We present posterior predictions of the degree distribution in Section 8.4 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 6 of the original submission:
\bauthq\input{degrees.tex}\eauthq

\bbq
Additional Comments

Overall the paper is well-written, but as mentioned above, some improvements could help to increase the clarity of the narrative.

In Section 3.2,

– The authors first discuss how the model is capable of detecting potential superspreaders - this could be highlighted with an appropriate subsection heading (somewhere before the “Short- and Long-tailed degree distributions”), in order to make the distinction between these two features of the model more obvious to readers.
\ebq

To highlight the advantages of the proposed semiparametric modeling framework,
we have divided Section 4 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 3.2 of the original submission,
into the following subsections:
\bauthq
\bi
\item[] Section 4 Semiparametric population model
\bi
\item[] Section 4.1 Detecting potential superspreaders
\item[] Section 4.2 Short- and long-tailed degree distributions
\ei
\ei
\eauthq
In addition, 
we have strengthened the writing in Section 4.
Please see the revised submission.

\bbq
– The discussion of the impact of the $\theta_i$’s should be more fleshed out. What are some specific cases where you get long-tailed degree distributions? A (brief) simulation (with figures) of how various collections of $\theta_i$’s lead to different types/shapes of degree distributions could be helpful.
\ebq

To demonstrate that Dirichlet process priors can accommodate short- and long-tailed degree distributions,
we have generated three sets of degree parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N$ from the Dirichlet process prior with concentration parameter $\alpha=5$ and base distribution $N(-5,\, 25)$.
We have added the results to Section 4.2 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 3.2 of the original submission:
\bauthq\input{dpp.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
In Sections 4.2, the authors define likelihood-ignorable missing data and in Section 4.3, the authors discuss how this impacts Bayesian inference. This was a little confusing at first read; I think it would be helpful if you briefly discussed the difference between these two topics before the likelihood-ignorable definition.
\ebq

We apologize for the lack of clarity.
In the revised submission,
we mention that
\bi
\item we are interested in Bayesian inference based on incomplete data;
\item to conduct Bayesian inference based on incomplete data,
we need to separate the complete-data generating process from the incomplete-data generating process.
\ei
We therefore open Section 6 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 4.2 of the original submission,
as follows:
\bauthq\input{bayesian.inference.tex}\eauthq
After separating the complete-data generating process from the incomplete-data generating process in Section 6.1,
we introduce the definition of a likelihood-ignorable incomplete-data generating process in Section 6.1:
\bauthq
{\bf Definition: likelihood-ignorable incomplete-data generating process.}
{Assume that the parameters $\bvartheta$, $\bta$, $\btheta$ are variation-independent in the sense that the parameter space of $(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta)$ is given by a product space of the form $\Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta}$ and that the parameters of the population model $\bta$ and $\btheta$ and the parameter of the incomplete-data generating process $\bvartheta$ are independent under the prior,
\bea
\label{joint.prior}
%p(\bvartheta \mid \bta, \btheta) \= p(\bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & \bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta},\; \bta \in \Omega_{\bta},\; \btheta \in \Omega_{\btheta}.
%(\bvartheta, \bta, \btheta) \in \Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta},\hspace{1.9cm}
p(\bvartheta \mid \bta,\, \btheta)
\= p(\bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & (\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta) \in \Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta}.
\eea
% Remark: The marginal prior of $\bvartheta$ is proper.
% Remark: since the sample space of $\bA$ is given by $\{0, 1\}^s$, where $s > 0$, we are on the boundary of the convex hull of the sample space of sufficient statistics with probability 1, meaning that the prior must be proper for the marginal posterior to be proper; no, not in general true, but...convenient to assume to ensure good behavior...
If the probability of observing data does not depend on the values of the unobserved data,
\bea
\label{conditional.u}
p(\baa \mid \bx,\, \by,\, \bvartheta)
\;=\; p(\baa \mid \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & \baa,\; \bx,\; \by \mbox{ and all } \bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta},
\eea
then the incomplete-data generating process is called likelihood-ignorable, 
and otherwise non-ignorable.
}
\eauthq
We then mention in Section 6.2:
\bauthq\input{bayes.intro}

\proposition\label{theorem.2}
{If the incomplete-data generating process is likelihood-ignorable and the prior $p(\bta,\, \btheta)$ is proper,
the parameter $\bvartheta$ of the incomplete-data generating process and the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model are independent under the posterior,
\bea
\nonumber
\label{result1}
p(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})
&\propto& p(\bvartheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})\; p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}}),
\eea
and Bayesian inference for the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model can be based on the marginal posterior $p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})$,
\bea
\label{main.result}
p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})
= \dfrac{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\; p(\by \mid \btheta)\; p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}}{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int\int\int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\, p(\by \mid \btheta)\, p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}} \dd \bta \dd \btheta},
\eea
which can be computed without requiring knowledge about the incomplete-data generating process.}
% Remark: difference to Rubin (1976): application to epidemics; marginal prior of $\bvartheta$ is proper, so that the marginal posterior of $\bvartheta$ is proper, whereas Rubin (1976) assumes that the integral of the marginal posterior is proper.
\eauthq
We hope that Section 6 of the revised submission makes these ideas more accessible.

\bbq
In Section 4.4, it would be helpful to provide some examples of alternative sampling schemes, for context. Perhaps adding something like “..., rather than sampling hospital patients.” 
\ebq

Thank you for your constructive suggestion.
We have revised the example in question as follows:
\bauthq\em\input{hospital.tex}
\eauthq
Please note that the example can be found in Section 6.1 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 4.4 of the original submission.

%\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
to the end of the first sentence in that section. How is infectious disease data typically collected and/or sampled?
\ebq

An excellent question,
thank you.
While we are not epidemiologists,
we believe that it is challenging to characterize how epidemiological data are typically collected,
because epidemics are rare events that occur at random times and in random places.
Therefore, 
how data are collected,
and which data are collected, 
seems to depend on a large number of factors:
e.g.,
the location of the outbreak;
which resources are available to local authorities;
which laws govern data collection;
and other factors.

We have addressed your question in Section 5 of the revised submission by first clarifying that data are often incomplete:
\bauthq\input{intro.incomplete.tex}\eauthq
We then mention possible reasons for incomplete data in Section 5.1 of the revised submission:
\bauthq\input{incomplete.data.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.5cm}

\bbq
When the link-tracing sampling scheme is first discussed, it may be helpful to readers if other common versions of this approach were explicitly called out here, such as response-driven sampling (mentioned later in the paper) and snowball sampling.
\ebq

We agree.
In accordance,
we have added in Section 5.2 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 4.4 of the original submission,
the following comment:
\bauthq\input{snowball.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
In Section 5, the creation of the subpopulations needs more context. For example, consider first mentioning that the simulations will be based on model (8), so as to provide some motivation for the subpopulations. Additionally, some context would be useful here - e.g., the $Y_i$’s correspond to densely, moderately, and sparsely connected subgroups.
\ebq

We have improved Section 7 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 5 of the original submission,
in accordance:
\bauthq\input{sim.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
In Section 5.1, the explanation of the truncated Dirichlet process prior needs to be more informative or even just replaced with a reference to the relevant information in the Supplementary Materials. In particular, this phrase is particularly unhelpful: “Truncated Dirichlet process priors are approximate Dirichlet process priors based on truncating Dirichlet process priors...”
\ebq

We agree that the original presentation of the truncated Dirichlet process priors was too short.
In the revised submission,
we have added Section 6.3 to introduce truncated Dirichlet process priors:

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bauthq\subsubsection*{6.3 Truncated Dirichlet process priors}\input{truncated.dpp.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
Sections 5.1 and 5.2 need to be more fleshed out and more clearly differentiated.

– If Section 5.2 samples from the population contact network, how is the population contact network used in the model estimation in Section 5.1?

– Further, it’s not super clear to me how exactly the population contacts are or are not incorporated in the estimation, in general. Since this seems to be one of the main arguments in the paper (i.e. point \#3 mentioned above), this must be made more clear in the text.
\ebq

Good point,
thank you.
In Section 5.2 of the revised submission,
which discusses the importance of sampling contacts,
we point out how observed contacts are used to estimate the population model:
\bauthq\input{importance.tex}\eauthq

\hide{

In Section 6.2,
which corresponds to Section 4.3 of the original submission,
we remind readers:
\bauthq
As pointed out in Section 5.2,
sampling contacts helps infer the unobserved sources of infections,
which in turn helps infer the population model.
\eauthq

}

\vspace{-.15cm}

\bbq
– Additionally, it’s not clear to me how Figure 2 “...demonstrates that samples of contacts reduce the MSE”. This figure demonstrates that MSE decreases as the population network size increases, but I don’t see any comparison between models with and without samples from the population contact network.
\ebq

In Figure 2 of the original submission,
the MSE of the posterior median and mean of parameters is plotted against the sample size $n = 0$,\, $25$,\, $50$,\, $75$,\, $100$,\, $125$,\, $150$,\, $187$.
If $n=0$, 
no contacts are observed,
otherwise a subset of contacts is observed.
Figure 2 therefore allows to compare the MSE of the posterior median and mean of parameters with and without samples of contacts.

We have clarified in Section 7.2 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 5.2 of the original submission:
\bauthq
We generate 1,000 ego-centric samples of sizes $n = 25$,\, $50$,\, $75$,\, $100$,\, $125$,\, $150$,\, $187$ from the population of size $N = 187$.
We estimate the population model from each sample of contacts along with observations of the exposure, infectious, and removal times of infected population members.
In addition,
we estimate the population model without observations of contacts,
which corresponds to a sample size of $n=0$,
using observations of the exposure, infectious, and removal times of infected population members.
\eauthq
In addition,
we report in Section 7.2 of the revised submission:
\bauthq\input{sims.tex}\eauthq
Last,
but not least,
we have clarified in the caption of Figure 3 of the revised submission, 
which corresponds to Figure 2 of the original submission:
\bauthq\input{mse.plot.tex}\eauthq

\bbq
– A reference to the supplementary materials (i.e., the details regarding the MCMC algorithm provided therein) should be made early in this section.
\ebq

We have added in Section 8.3 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 6 of the original submission,
the following remark:
\bauthq\input{mcmc.tex}\eauthq

\vspace{-.25cm}

\bbq
In Section 6,

– More discussion of Figure 4 would be helpful. At first read, these are the questions that came to my mind: Perhaps I missed something in the description of the data, but isn’t the posterior just regurgitating the information in the prior (based on the doctors’ reports of suspected contact/spread)? What data is the model using to update the prior? But if I understand it correctly, we have prior information for the transmission network, T, but in Figure 4 you are highlighting the posterior memberships in the subpopulations (something like the Ci’s from the simulation study) of the population contact network, Y. This needs to be made more clear in the paper.
\ebq

Great question,
thank you.
In addition to the assessments of doctors,
the observed infectious and removal times help inform who infected whom and who was in contact with whom,
because 
\bi
\item the observed infectious and removal times reveal when infected population members were infectious,
which helps narrow down the possible sources of infections;
\item an infection implies a contact.
\ei
We explain these insights in Section 8.1 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 6 of the original submission:

In addition,
we mention in Section 8.4 of the revised submission,
which is concerned with posterior predictions of the degree distribution:

– The figures in this section could be improved to more clearly and effectively communicate their intended purposes. In Figure 3, these two plots appear nearly identical - what features are we supposed to notice as differing across the two models? In Figure 5, one of the main intended takeaways is the difference between the estimated connectivities of the two subgroups - this would be more obvious if the densities were plotted on the same scale (or alternatively, represented by box plots or violin plots).
\ebq

We have improved the captions and descriptions of all figures and tables and have made figures more comparable by using the same scale where appropriate:
see, 
e.g.,
Figures 4 and 6 of the revised submission.

– It should be noted here that assuming the missingness is ”ignorable” is a strong assumption.
\ebq

We mention that in Section 8.2 of the revised submission,
which corresponds to Section 6 of the original submission:

Section 7 makes regular references to “computational and statistical costs.” What exactly is meant by a “statistical cost”? Poor model assumptions? Increased variance?
\ebq

We apologize for the lack of precision concerning the terms ``computational costs" and ``statistical costs."
Although the term ``computational costs" can have many meanings,
we use the term ``computational costs" in a narrow sense:
By ``computational costs,"
we mean computing time (``walltime").
By ``statistical costs,"
we mean the costs associated with collecting more data,
which may be needed to learn more sophisticated models from data.
In the revised submission,
we have omitted the term ``statistical costs" because it is too vague to be useful,
and have replaced the term ``computational costs" by ``computing time."
We have colored the corresponding changes in Section 9 by using the color red.
Please note that Section 7 of the original submission corresponds to Section 9 of the revised submission.

Other small suggested edits

• At the end of Section 4.1, the bulleted sentence ends with “...combinations of them.” This should be changed to “...or some combinations of the above.”
\ebq

We have rewritten the subsection on incomplete data and the quoted statement is not included in the revised submission.
Please note that Section 4.1 of the original submission corresponds to Section 5.1 of the revised submission.
