\section{Motivation}
\label{introduction}

\alert{The spread of infectious diseases through populations by way of contact represents an important public health concern.
The spread of COVID-19 and other viruses underscores the importance of understanding how infectious diseases spread by way of contact and how the spread of infectious diseases can be curbed.
Indeed,
COVID-19 is not the first virus to spread around the globe,
and it will not be the last:
Epidemics have been documented since at least the Middle Ages (e.g., the plague) and are primed to become more frequent rather than less frequent in the interconnected world of the twenty-first century (as the recent spread of COVID-19, MERS, SARS, Ebola, and Zika demonstrates).}

\subsection{Advantages of network-based approaches to epidemics}

We follow a network-based approach to modeling the spread of infectious diseases.\linebreak
A network-based approach is appealing,
because the network of contacts in a population determines how infectious diseases can spread (e.g., \citeauthor{KeEa05} \citeyear{KeEa05}; \citeauthor{Daetal11} \citeyear{Daetal11}; \citeauthor*{WeBaHu11} \citeyear{WeBaHu11}).
One of the advantages of a network-based approach is that heterogeneity in the number of contacts can be captured \citep[e.g.,][]{Daetal11} along with other features of population contact networks \citep[e.g.,][]{WeBaHu11}.
Indeed,
conventional models of epidemics---including classic and lattice-based Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models \citep[e.g.,][]{AnBr00,Daetal11}---can be considered to be degenerate versions of network-based models,
in the sense that such models postulate that with probability $1$ the population contact network is of a known form:
e.g.,
with probability $1$ each population member is in contact with every other population member.
Worse,
the postulated form of the population contact network may not resemble real-world contact networks.
A second advantage is that a network-based approach helps study the structure of a population contact network and its generating mechanism,
helping generalize findings to similar populations.

\subsection{Shortcomings of existing network-based approaches}

Motivated by the shortcomings of classic and lattice-based SIR and SEIR models of epidemics,
\citet{BrNe02},
\citet*{GrWeHu10,GrWeHu11},
\citet{epinet.jss},
\citet*{Buetal21},
and others have explored a network-based approach to epidemics.
While a network-based approach is more appealing than classic and lattice-based SIR and SEIR models,
existing network-based models of epidemics have shortcomings.
As we discuss in Section \ref{sec:shortcomings}, 
one of the more important shortcomings is that existing network-based approaches are either not flexible models of degree distributions or induce short-tailed degree distributions,
that is,
the population does not contain population members who have far more contacts than the bulk of the population members.
Short-tailed degree distributions are problematic,
because degree distributions of real-world contact networks are thought to be long-tailed \citep*[e.g.,][]{La94,AlBa02,JoHa04,JoHa03,HaJo04} and the population members in the upper tail of the degree distribution represent an important public health concern:
Population members with many contacts can infect many others and are hence potential superspreaders.
Indeed,
there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that superspreaders have played a role in the SARS epidemic in 2002--2003, the MERS epidemic in 2015, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

\subsection{Proposed network-based approach}

We introduce a flexible semiparametric modeling framework based on infinite mixture models and Dirichlet process priors \citep{Fe73,Teh2007},
with at least three advantages.
First,
it shares with existing network-based approaches the advantage that it enables researchers to study the structure of a population contact network and its impact on the spread of infectious diseases.
Second,
in contrast to existing network-based approaches,
it is a flexible model of short- and long-tailed degree distributions and can detect potential superspreaders.
Third,
it addresses the important issue of incomplete data and can deal with a wide range of missing data and sample data.
% As we discuss in Section 5.1, 
Starting from first principles,
we show when the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters of the population model.
In addition,
we stress the importance of collecting network data with a view to reducing the posterior uncertainty about the population contact network and its generating mechanism along with possible sources of infections.
We demonstrate the proposed framework by simulations and an application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in 2015 \citep{Ki15}.
The MERS epidemic was driven by the coronavirus MERS,
which is related to the coronaviruses SARS and COVID-19.
We detect three to five potential superspreaders,
who may have had a great impact on the outcome of the outbreak.

\subsection{Structure of the paper}

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
A network-based stochastic model of epidemics is reviewed in Section \ref{parametric}.
We discuss shortcomings of parametric population models in Section \ref{sec:shortcomings} and introduce semiparametric population models in Section \ref{population.model}.
In Section \ref{importance},
we argue that collecting complete data is all but impossible,
and stress the importance of collecting network data.
Principled Bayesian inference based on incomplete data is discussed in Section \ref{bay}.
We present simulation results in Section \ref{simulation.study} and an application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in Section \ref{application}.
We conclude with an extended discussion of open questions and directions for future research in Section \ref{discussion}.

\section{A network-based stochastic model of epidemics}
\label{parametric}

We introduce a network-based stochastic model of epidemics.
We first describe a generic data-generating process in Section \ref{sec:data.generating.process} and then review parametric population models in Section \ref{likelihood.function}.

We consider a population with $N < \infty$ population members,
who may be connected by contacts.
In the simplest case,
contacts among population members are time-invariant and are either absent or present.
We discuss in Section \ref{temporal} possible extensions to time-evolving population contact networks.

A basic data-generating process is shown in Figure \ref{data.generating.process} and can be described as follows:
\bi
\item Generate a population contact network.
\item Conditional on the population contact network, 
generate an epidemic.
\ei
The population contact network is generated by a random graph model as described in Section \ref{likelihood.function} (parametric) and Section \ref{population.model} (semiparametric).
Conditional on the population contact network,
an infectious disease spreads through the population by way of contact,
governed by a continuous-time stochastic process such as the SIR and SEIR model \citep{AnBr00,BrNe02,GrWeHu10,GrWeHu11}.
We focus on the network-based SEIR model,
which can be sketched as follows \citep{BrNe02,GrWeHu10,GrWeHu11}.
In the simplest case,
the initial state of the stochastic process consists of a population with one infected population member and $N - 1$ susceptible population members.
Infected population members pass through three states:
the exposed state;
the infectious state;
and the removed state.
In the exposed state,
population members are infected, but cannot infect others.
In the infectious state, 
population members can infect susceptible population members by way of contact,
with transmissions being independent across contacts.
In the final state---the removed state---population members have either recovered and are immune to re-infection or have died,
and hence cannot infect others.
The epidemic continues until all infected population members are removed from the population.
All of the described events---the event that an infectious population member infects a susceptible population member and the transition of an infected population member from the exposed to the infectious state and from the infectious state to the removed state---are independent and occur at random times.
The waiting times until these events occur follow Exponential or Gamma distributions.
More specific assumptions about the distributions of waiting times and the population contact network are detailed in Section \ref{likelihood.function} and in the monographs of \citet{AnBr00} and \citet{epibook}.

\subsection{Parametric population models}
\label{likelihood.function}

Consider an epidemic that started at time $0$ and ceased by time $0 < t < \infty$.
We assume that the identities of infected population members are known and denoted by $1, \dots, M$,
where $M \in \{1, \dots, N\}$.
The population contact network is represented by $\bY = \{Y_{i,j}\}_{i < j}^N \in \mY = \{0, 1\}^{\binom{N}{2}}$,
where $Y_{i,j} = 1$ if population members $i$ and $j$ are in contact during the epidemic and $Y_{i,j} = 0$ otherwise.
Since contacts are undirected and self-contacts are meaningless,
we assume that $Y_{i,j} = Y_{j,i}$ and $Y_{i,i} = 0$ hold with probability 1.
The transmissions are denoted by $\bT = \{T_{i,j}\}_{i \neq j}^N$,
where $T_{i,j} = 1$ if $i$ infects $j$ and $T_{i,j} = 0$ otherwise.
Observe that $Y_{i,j} = 0$ implies $T_{i,j} = T_{j,i} = 0$ whereas $T_{i,j} = T_{j,i} = 1$ implies $Y_{i,j} = 1$ with probability 1.
The starting times of the exposure, infectious, and removal periods of infected population members are denoted by
$\bE = \{E_i\}_{i=1}^N \in \mR_+^N$,\,
$\bI = \{I_i\}_{i=1}^N \in \mR_+^N$,\,
and $\bR = \{R_i\}_{i=1}^N \in \mR_+^N$,
respectively,
where $\mR_+ = (0,\, \infty)$ and $E_i < I_i < R_i$ holds with probability 1;
note that $E_i,\, I_i,\, R_i$ are undefined if population member $i$ is not infected.
We write $\bX = (\bE, \bI, \bR, \bT)$ and, 
in a mild abuse of language,
we refer to $\bX$ as an epidemic. 

The complete-data likelihood function, 
given complete observations $\bx$ and $\by$ of the epidemic $\bX$ and the population contact network $\bY$,
is of the form
\bea
\label{eq:likelihood}
L(\bta,\, \btheta;\; \bx,\, \by) 
&\propto& L(\bta_E;\, \bx)\; L(\bta_I;\, \bx)\; L(\beta;\, \bx,\, \by)\; L(\btheta;\, \by),
\eea
where $\bta = (\bta_E,\, \bta_I,\, \beta) \in \Omega_{\bta} \subseteq \mR^{d_1}$ ($d_1 \geq 1$) and $\btheta \in \Omega_{\btheta} \subseteq \mR^{d_2}$ ($d_2 \geq 1$) are the parameter vectors of the population model generating the epidemic $\bX$ and the population contact network $\bY$,
respectively.
We describe each component of the complete-data likelihood function in turn,
along with its parameters.
\hide{
$\beta$ is the parameter governing the rate of infection;
and $\bta_E$ and $\bta_I$ are the parameter vectors governing the length of time spent in the exposed and infectious state,
respectively.
}

The components $L(\bta_E;\, \bx)$ and $L(\bta_I;\, \bx)$ of the likelihood function are of the form
\bea
L(\bta_E;\, \bx) 
&\propto& \dis\prod_{i=1}^M p(I_i - E_i \mid E_i,\, \bta_E)
%& = & \dfrac{\left[\dprod_{i=1}^m (I_i - E_i)\right]^{\eta_{E,1}-1}\, \eta_E^{-m\,\eta_{E,1}} \exp\left(-\dfrac{b}{\eta_E}\right)}{[\Gamma(\eta_{E,1})]^m}
\eea
\bea
L(\bta_I;\, \bx)
&\propto& \dis\prod_{i=1}^M p(R_i - I_i \mid I_i,\, \bta_I),
%& = & \dfrac{\left[\dprod_{i=1}^m (R_i - I_i)\right]^{\eta_{I,1}-1}\, \eta_I^{-m\,\eta_{I,1}} \exp\left(-\dfrac{c}{\eta_I}\right)}{[\Gamma(\eta_{I,1})]^m},
\eea
%where $\eta_{E,1} >0, \eta_E >0, \eta_{I,1}>0, \eta_I>0$, $b = \sum_{i=1}^m (I_i - E_i)$, and $c = \sum_{i=1}^m (R_i - I_i)$.
where $p(.\mid E_i,\, \bta_E)$ and $p(.\mid I_i,\, \bta_I)$ are densities with suitable support parameterized by $\bta_E$ and $\bta_I$,
respectively:
e.g.,
the densities may be Gamma densities,
with $\bta_E \in \mR_+ \times \mR_+$ and $\bta_I \in \mR_+ \times \mR_+$ being scale and shape parameters of Gamma densities.

Under the assumption that the waiting times until infectious population members infect susceptible population members are independent Exponential$(\beta)$ random variables with rate of infection $\beta \in \mR_+$,
the component $L(\beta;\, \bx,\, \by)$ of the likelihood function is given by
\bea
L(\beta;\, \bx,\, \by)
&\propto& \beta^{M-1}\, \exp(-\beta\; a(\bx,\, \by)),
\eea
where $a(.) > 0$ is defined by
\bea
\label{A}
a(\bx,\, \by) = \dsum_{i=1}^M \dsum_{j=1}^M y_{i,j}\, 1_{I_i < E_j} \max(\min(E_j, R_i) - I_i,\, 0) + \dsum_{i=1}^M d_i(\bx,\, \by)\, (R_i - I_i).
\eea
Here, 
$1_{I_i < E_j}$ is $1$ in the event of $I_i < E_j$ and is $0$ otherwise, 
and $d_i(\bx,\, \by)$ is the number of non-infected population members in contact with population member $i$.
The function $a(\bx,\, \by)$ was derived in \citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10}.

To represent existing (parametric) and proposed (semiparametric) population models along with possible extensions in a unifying framework,
it is convenient to parameterize the distribution of the population contact network $\bY$ in exponential-family form \citep{Su19}.
The component $L(\btheta;\, \by)$ of the likelihood function can then be written as
\bea
\label{general}
L(\btheta;\, \by) 
&\propto& \exp\left(\btheta^\top s(\by) - \psi(\btheta)\right), & \by \in \bbY,
\eea
where $\btheta$ is a $d_2$-vector of natural parameters, 
$s(\by)$ is a $d_2$-vector of sufficient statistics,
and 
\bea
\label{psi}
\psi(\btheta)
\= \log \dis\sum_{\by \in \mY} \exp\left(\btheta^\top s(\by)\right), & \btheta \in \Omega_{\btheta} = \{\btheta \in \mR^{d_2}: \psi(\btheta) < \infty\} = \mR^{d_2}.
\eea
\citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10} assumed that contacts are independent Bernoulli$(\mu)$ ($\mu \in (0, 1)$) random variables,
which is equivalent to the one-parameter exponential family with natural parameter $\theta = \mbox{logit}(\mu) \in \mR$ and sufficient statistic $s(\by) = \sum_{i<j}^N y_{i,j}$.
\citet{GrWeHu11} extended the exponential-family framework to include predictors of contacts by assuming that  contacts are independent Bernoulli$(\mu_{i,j})$ ($\mu_{i,j} \in (0, 1)$) random variables with $\mbox{logit}(\mu_{i,j}) = \sum_{k=1}^{d_2} \theta_k\, s_{i,j,k}(y_{i,j}) \in \mR$,
that is,
the log odds of the probability of a contact between two population members is a weighted sum of functions $s_{i,j,k}(y_{i,j})$ of covariates and $y_{i,j}$,
weighted by $\theta_k \in \mR$ ($k = 1, \dots, d_2$).
A specific example is given by $s_{i,j,1}(y_{i,j}) = y_{i,j}$ and $s_{i,j,2}(y_{i,j}) = c_{i,j}\, y_{i,j}$,
where $c_{i,j} \in \{0, 1\}$ is a same-hospital indicator,
equal to $1$ if population members $i$ and $j$ were in the same hospital during the epidemic and $0$ otherwise.
The example model is equivalent to a two-parameter exponential family with natural parameters $\theta_1 \in \mR$ and $\theta_2 \in \mR$ and sufficient statistics $s_1(\by) = \sum_{i<j}^N s_{i,j,1}(y_{i,j})$ and $s_2(\by) = \sum_{i<j}^N s_{i,j,2}(y_{i,j})$.
If $\theta_2=0$,
the model of \citet{GrWeHu11} reduces to the model of \citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10}.

\section{Shortcomings of parametric population models}
\label{sec:shortcomings}

While the network-based SEIR models reviewed in Section \ref{likelihood.function} are more flexible than classic and lattice-based SIR and SEIR models,
such parametric population models have shortcomings.
Chief among them is the fact that the induced degree distributions are short-tailed.
Here,
the degrees of population members are the numbers of contacts of population members.

For example,
the model of \citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10} assumes that contacts are independent Bernoulli$(\mu)$ ($\mu \in (0, 1)$) random variables.
As a consequence,
the degrees of population members are Binomial$(N-1,\, \mu)$ and approximately Poisson$(N\, \mu)$ distributed provided $N$ is large, $\mu$ is small, and $N\, \mu$ tends to a constant,
as one would expect in sparse population contact networks where the expected degrees of population members are bounded above by a finite constant and hence $\mu$ is a constant multiple of $1 / N$.
The model of \citet{GrWeHu11} allows degree distributions to be longer-tailed than the model of \citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10}---depending on available covariates---but the induced degree distribution may nonetheless be shorter-tailed than the degree distributions of real-world contact networks.
The degree distributions of real-world contact networks are believed to be long-tailed \citep[e.g.,][]{La94,AlBa02,JoHa04,JoHa03,HaJo04}:
e.g.,
in networks of sexual contacts arising in the study of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases,
some population members tend to have many more sexual contacts than most other population members.
The population members in the upper tail of the degree distribution represent an important public health concern,
because population members with many contacts can infect many others and are hence potential superspreaders.

Last,
but not least,
it is worth mentioning that scale-free networks with power law degree distributions \citep{BaAl99,AlBa02} are known to induce long-tailed degree distributions.
However,
aside from the fact that the construction of scale-free networks is incomplete and ambiguous \citep*[][]{Boetal01},
those one-parameter models are not flexible models of degree distributions, 
and proper statistical procedures do not lend much support to informal claims that the degree distributions of many real-world contact networks are scale-free:
see,
e.g.,
the work of \citet{JoHa04,JoHa03,HaJo04} on the degree distributions of sexual contact networks arising in the study of HIV, 
and the discussion of \citet*{scalefree}.

Therefore,
more flexible population models are needed to accommodate both short- and long-tailed degree distributions.

\section{Semiparametric population model}
\label{population.model}

We introduce a semiparametric population model to accommodate both short- and long-tailed degree distributions and detect potential superspreaders.
The population model is semiparametric in that the prior of the epidemiological parameter $\bta$ is parametric,
while the prior of the network parameter $\btheta$ is nonparametric.

Let $s_1(\by), \dots, s_N(\by)$ be the degrees of population members $1, \dots, N$,
where the degree of population member $i$ is defined as $s_i(\by) = \sum_{j=1:\, j \neq i}^N\, y_{i,j}$ ($i = 1, \dots, N$).
A simple model of the sequence of degrees $s_1(\by), \dots, s_N(\by)$ is given by the exponential family of distributions with probability mass functions of the form
\bea
\label{degree_model}
p_{\btheta}(\by)
 &=& \exp\left(\dis\sum_{i = 1}^N \theta_i\, s_i(\by) - \psi(\btheta)\right),
 & \by \in \mY,
\eea
where the degrees $s_1(\by), \dots, s_N(\by)$ are the sufficient statistics and the weights of the degrees $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N \in \mR$ are the natural parameters of the exponential family,
and $\psi(\btheta)$ ensures that $\sum_{\by \in \mY}\, p_{\btheta}(\by) = 1$.
The exponential-family form of \eqref{degree_model} can be motivated by its maximum entropy property and other attractive mathematical properties \citep{Su19}.
A convenient property is that the resulting likelihood function factorizes as follows:
\bea
\label{degree_model_rewritten}
L(\btheta;\, \by)
 &\propto& \exp\left(\dis\sum_{i = 1}^N \theta_i\, s_i(\by) - \psi(\btheta)\right)
 &\propto& \dis\prod_{i < j}^N \exp\left(\lambda_{i,j}(\btheta)\, y_{i,j} - \psi_{i,j}(\btheta)\right),
\eea
where 
\bea
\psi(\btheta)
\= \dsum_{i<j}^N \psi_{i,j}(\btheta),
\eea
with $\psi_{i,j}(\btheta)$ and $\lambda_{i,j}(\btheta)$ defined by
\bea
\psi_{i,j}(\btheta) 
&=& \log\left(1 + \exp\left(\lambda_{i,j}(\btheta)\right)\right)
\eea
and
\bea
\label{log.odds}
\lambda_{i,j}(\btheta) 
&=& \theta_i + \theta_j,
\eea
respectively.

To interpret the natural parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N$ of the exponential family,
observe that the model is equivalent to assuming that the contacts $Y_{i,j}$ are independent Bernoulli$(\mu_{i,j})$ ($\mu_{i,j} \in (0, 1)$) random variables with $\mbox{logit}(\mu_{i,j}) = \theta_i + \theta_j \in \mR$.
Thus,
the log odds of the probability of a contact between population members $i$ and $j$ is additive in the propensities of $i$ and $j$ to be in contact with others.
%We refer to the natural parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N$ as the degree parameters of population members $1, \dots, N$,
%respectively.
It is worth noting that the resulting model can be viewed as an adaptation of the classic $p_1$-model \citep{HpLs81} to undirected random graphs and is known as the $\beta$-model \citep*{DiChSl11,RiPeFi13,ChKaLe19}.

To cluster population members based on degrees and detect potential superspreaders,
we assume that the degree parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N$ are generated by a Dirichlet process prior \citep{Fe73,Teh2007},
that is,
\bea
\theta_1 &\sim& G\s
 \\
 \theta_{i} \mid \theta_1, \dots, \theta_{i-1} 
 &\sim&
 \dis\frac{1}{\alpha + i - 1} \dis\left(\alpha\, G + \dsum_{h=1}^{i-1} \delta_{\theta_h}\right),\; i = 2, 3, \dots,
\eea
where $\alpha > 0$ denotes the concentration parameter and $G$ denotes the base distribution of the Dirichlet process prior,
while $\delta_{\theta_h}$ denotes a point mass at $\theta_h$. 
A convenient choice of the base distribution $G$ is $N(\mu,\, \sigma^{2})$ ($\mu \in \mR$, $\sigma^2 \in \mR_+$).

Draws from a Dirichlet process prior can be generated by generating 
\bi
\item the first draw from $G$;
\item the $i$-th draw with a probability proportional to $\alpha$ from $G$,
and otherwise drawing one of the existing draws $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_{i-1}$ at random.
\ei

\subsection{Detecting potential superspreaders}

\alert{The described construction of Dirichlet process priors reveals that sampling the degree parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_N$ from a Dirichlet process prior implies that some of the degree parameters are resampled.
As a consequence,
some population members share the same degree parameters.
Thus,
Dirichlet process priors induce a partition of the population into subpopulations,
where subpopulations share the same degree parameters.
In applications to real-world data,
we can make probabilistic statements about which population members belong to subpopulations with high degree parameters based on the posterior distribution.
A short demonstration is provided by the application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea presented in Section 8.4.}

\subsection{Importance of collecting network data}
\label{sample.networks}

\alert{\input{importance.tex}}

We describe two sampling designs for generating samples of contacts along with epidemiological data:
ego-centric sampling and link-tracing.
Some background on ego-centric sampling and link-tracing of contacts (but not epidemiological data) can be found in 
\citet{ThFr00}, 
\citet{HaGi09},
and \citet{KrMo17}.
\alert{\input{snowball.tex}}A recent review of these and other network sampling designs can be found in \citet[][]{ScKrBu17}.
We adapt these ideas to sampling contacts along with epidemiological data.

An ego-centric sample of contacts and epidemiological data can be generated as follows:
\bi
\item[(a)] Generate a probability sample of population members.
\item[(b)] For each sampled population member,
collect data on the contacts of the population member and,
should the population member be infected,
data on possible sources of infection along with the exposure, infectious, and removal times of the population member.
\ei
A probability sample of population members can be generated by any sampling design for sampling from finite populations \citep[e.g.,][]{Th12}.

An interesting extension of ego-centric sampling is link-tracing.
Link-tracing exploits the observed contacts of sampled population members to include additional population members into the sample.
A $k$-wave link-tracing sample of contacts and epidemiological data can be generated as follows:
\bi
\item[(1)] Wave $l = 0$: Generate an ego-centric sample.
\item[(2)] Wave $l = 1, \dots, k$:
\bi
\item[(a)] Add the population members who are connected to the population members of wave $l - 1$ to the sample.
\item[(b)] For each added population member,
collect all relevant data.
\ei
\ei
Ego-centric sampling can be considered to be a special case of $k$-wave link-tracing with $k = 0$.
We use ego-entric sampling in the simulation study in Section \ref{simulation.study}.

\section{Bayesian inference}
\label{bay}

\alert{\input{bayesian.inference.tex}}

\subsection{Complete- and incomplete-data generating process}
\label{likelihood.ignorable}

\alert{To prepare the ground for principled Bayesian inference,
we separate the complete-data generating process from the incomplete-data generating process,
adapting the generic ideas of \citet{Ru76} to stochastic models of epidemics.}

To do so,
let $\bA = \{\bA_E, \bA_I, \bA_R, \bA_T, \bA_Y\}$ be indicators of which data are observed,
where $\bA_E = \{A_{E,i}\}_{i=1}^N \in \{0, 1\}^N$,
$\bA_I = \{A_{I,i}\}_{i=1}^N \in \{0, 1\}^N$,
$\bA_R = \{A_{R,i}\}_{i=1}^N \in \{0, 1\}^N$,\linebreak
$\bA_T = \{A_{T,i,j}\}_{i \neq j}^M  \in \{0, 1\}^{M^2-M}$, 
and $\bA_Y = \{A_{Y,i,j}\}_{i<j}^N \in \{0, 1\}^{\binom{N}{2}}$ indicate whether the values of 
$\{E_i\}_{i=1}^N$, $\{I_i\}_{i=1}^N$, $\{R_i\}_{i=1}^N$, $\{T_{i,j}\}_{i \neq j}^M$, and $\{Y_{i,j}\}_{i<j}^N$ are observed,
respectively.
The sequence of indicators $\bA$ is considered to be a random variable,
with a distribution parameterized by $\bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta} \subseteq \mR^q$ ($q \geq 1$):
e.g.,
$\bvartheta \in [0, 1]^N$ may be a vector of sample inclusion probabilities,
where $\vartheta_i \in [0, 1]$ is the probability that population member $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ is sampled and data on the contacts of population member $i$ are collected.
The parameter $\bvartheta$ may be known or unknown.
We focus on the more challenging case where $\bvartheta$ is unknown.
The observed and unobserved subset of the complete data $(\bx,\, \by)$ are denoted by $\bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}}$ and $\bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}$ and $\by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}}$ and $\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}$,
respectively,
where $\bx = (\bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}})$ and $\by = (\by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}})$.

In Bayesian fashion,
we build a joint probability model for all knowns and unknowns and condition on all knowns.
Let
\bea
\label{joint}
p(\baa,\, \bx,\, \by,\, \bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta) 
\= p(\baa,\, \bx,\, \by \mid \bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta)\; p(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta)
\eea
be the joint probability density of $\baa$, $\bx$, $\by$, $\bvartheta$, $\bta$, $\btheta$,
where
\bea
\label{joint.prior}
p(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta) 
\= p(\bvartheta \mid \bta,\, \btheta)\; p(\bta,\, \btheta)
\eea
is the prior probability density of $\bvartheta$, $\bta$, $\btheta$ and
\bea
\label{joint.pdf}
p(\baa,\, \bx,\, \by \mid \bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta) 
\= p(\baa \mid \bx,\, \by,\, \bvartheta)\, p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\, p(\by \mid \btheta)
\eea
is the conditional probability density of $\baa$, $\bx$, $\by$ given $\bvartheta$, $\bta$, $\btheta$;
\hide{
It is natural to assume that
$p(\baa \mid \bx, \by, \bvartheta, \bta, \btheta) = p(\baa \mid \bx, \by, \bvartheta)$ does not depend on $\bta$ and $\btheta$,
$p(\bx \mid \by, \bvartheta, \bta, \btheta) = p(\bx \mid \by, \bta)$ does not depend on $\bvartheta$ and $\btheta$, 
and $p(\by \mid \bvartheta, \bta, \btheta) = p(\by \mid \btheta)$ does not depend on $\bvartheta$ and $\bta$;
}
note that $p(\by \mid \btheta) \equiv p_{\btheta}(\by)$.
It is worth noting that all of these probability densities are with respect to a suitable dominating measure,
but we do not wish to delve into measure-theoretic details,
which would distract from the main ideas.

\alert{To determine when the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model,
we introduce the following definition of a likelihood-ignorable incomplete-data generating process.}\s

{\bf Definition: likelihood-ignorable incomplete-data generating process.}
{\em 
Assume that the parameters $\bvartheta$, $\bta$, $\btheta$ are variation-independent in the sense that the parameter space of $(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta)$ is given by a product space of the form $\Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta}$ and that the parameters of the population model $\bta$ and $\btheta$ and the parameter of the incomplete-data generating process $\bvartheta$ are independent under the prior,
\bea
\label{joint.prior}
%p(\bvartheta \mid \bta, \btheta) \= p(\bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & \bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta},\; \bta \in \Omega_{\bta},\; \btheta \in \Omega_{\btheta}.
%(\bvartheta, \bta, \btheta) \in \Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta},\hspace{1.9cm}
p(\bvartheta \mid \bta,\, \btheta) 
\= p(\bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & (\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta) \in \Omega_{\bvartheta} \times \Omega_{\bta} \times \Omega_{\btheta}.
\eea
% Remark: The marginal prior of $\bvartheta$ is proper.
% Remark: since the sample space of $\bA$ is given by $\{0, 1\}^s$, where $s > 0$, we are on the boundary of the convex hull of the sample space of sufficient statistics with probability 1, meaning that the prior must be proper for the marginal posterior to be proper; no, not in general true, but...convenient to assume to ensure good behavior...
If the probability of observing data does not depend on the values of the unobserved data,
\bea
\label{conditional.u}
p(\baa \mid \bx,\, \by,\, \bvartheta)
\;=\; p(\baa \mid \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & \baa,\; \bx,\; \by \mbox{ and all } \bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta},
\eea
then the incomplete-data generating process is called likelihood-ignorable, 
and otherwise non-ignorable.
}

\vspace{-.35cm}

We provide two examples of likelihood-ignorable and non-ignorable incomplete-data generating processes.\s

\alert{{\bf Example: likelihood-ignorable.}}
\alert{\input{hospital.tex}}\s

\alert{A possible sampling design for generating samples of contacts and epidemiological data is link-tracing,
as described in Section \ref{sample.networks}.
Link-tracing exploits observed contacts of population members to increase the size of the sample,
which implies that the sample inclusion probabilities depend on observed contacts but do not depend on unobserved contacts:
\bea
p(\baa \mid \bx,\, \by,\, \bvartheta)
\;=\; p(\baa \mid \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bvartheta) & \mbox{for all} & \baa,\; \bx,\; \by \mbox{ and all } \bvartheta \in \Omega_{\bvartheta}.
\eea
Therefore,
link-tracing sampling designs for generating samples of contacts and epidemiological data are likelihood-ignorable,
as are ego-centric sampling designs.}
\vspace{.25cm}

{\bf Example: non-likelihood-ignorable.}
% Remark: censoring
{\em Suppose that there exists a constant $\delta > 0$ such that infected population members $i$ with mild symptoms and fast recovery ($R_i - I_i \leq \delta$) do not visit hospitals,
whereas infected population members $i$ with severe symptoms and slow recovery ($R_i - I_i > \delta$) do visit hospitals.
Hospitals collect data on infected population members who visit them,
but no data are collected on other population members.\s
}

Since the incomplete-data generating process excludes all infected population members with mild symptoms and fast recovery,
it cannot be ignored.
Statistical analyses ignoring it may give rise to misleading conclusions about the rate of infection $\beta$ and other parameters of the population model,
and may generate misleading predictions of future epidemics in the population of interest and similar populations.

\subsection{Bayesian inference based on incomplete data}
\label{bayesian.inference}

\alert{\input{bayes.intro.tex}}

\vspace{-.85cm}

\alert{
\proposition\label{theorem.2}
{\em If the incomplete-data generating process is likelihood-ignorable and the prior $p(\bta,\, \btheta)$ is proper,
the parameter $\bvartheta$ of the incomplete-data generating process and the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model are independent under the posterior,
\bea
\nonumber
\label{result1}
p(\bvartheta,\, \bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})
&\propto& p(\bvartheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})\; p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}}),
\eea
and Bayesian inference for the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model can be based on the marginal posterior $p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})$,
\bea
\label{main.result}
p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})
= \dfrac{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\; p(\by \mid \btheta)\; p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}}{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int\int\int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\, p(\by \mid \btheta)\, p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}} \dd \bta \dd \btheta},
\eea
which can be computed without requiring knowledge about the incomplete-data generating process.}
% Remark: difference to Rubin (1976): application to epidemics; marginal prior of $\bvartheta$ is proper, so that the marginal posterior of $\bvartheta$ is proper, whereas Rubin (1976) assumes that the integral of the marginal posterior is proper.
}

\s

\alert{It is worth noting that the unobserved contacts of non-infected population members can be summed out,
both in the numerator and the denominator of the ratio in \eqref{main.result},
because the contacts of population members are independent conditional on $\btheta$ by construction of the semiparametric population model described in Section 4.
In other words,
there is no need to use computational methods (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) to generate model-based imputations of unobserved contacts of non-infected population members,
which saves computing time.}

A proof of Proposition 1 can be found in the supplement.
The case of \citet{BrNe02} and \citet{GrWeHu10,GrWeHu11},
who considered Bayesian inference from observed infectious and removal times, 
is a special case of the incomplete-data framework considered here, 
with $\bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}} = \{\bI, \bR\}$ and $\by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}} = \{\}$.
In general,
when $\bx$ or $\by$ are partially observed,
Bayesian inference can be based on the marginal posterior of $\bta$ and $\btheta$ given the observed data,
provided the incomplete-data generating process is likelihood-ignorable.

\label{application}

\alert{We showcase the statistical framework introduced in Sections 4, 5, and 6 by applying it to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in 2015 \citep{Ki15}.}

\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\alert{The MERS outbreak in South Korea was driven by the coronavirus MERS,
which is related to the coronaviruses SARS and COVID-19.
We retrieved the data from the website {\tt http://english.mw.go.kr} of the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare on September 22, 2015.
The website has been removed since,
but the data can be obtained from the authors.
The first MERS case in South Korea was confirmed on May 20, 2015 and the last case was confirmed on July 4, 2015.
By September 22, 2015,
186 cases had been confirmed,
of which 144 had recovered while 35 had died,
all of whom are considered to be removed from the population.
7 cases had not removed by September 22, 2015, 
despite the fact that the last case of MERS was confirmed on July 4, 2015.
We assume that the removal times of those 7 cases are unobserved and that the outbreak ceased by September 22, 2015,
because the data base has not been updated by the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare since July 2015.
The data consist of the infectious times and removal times of the 186 infected population members, 
with 7 missing removal times.
The exposure times are unobserved and inferred along with the 7 missing removal times.

\hide{

\alert{Having said that,
these indirect observations have shortcomings:
\bi
\item The assessments of doctors are incomplete,
because the doctors did not specify possible sources of infections for 26 out of the 186 infected population members.
\item To the best of our knowledge,
the assessments of doctors were educated guesses of possible sources of infections.
%and were not based on genome-sequencing or other scientific methods.
\item An infection implies a contact,
but a contact may not lead to an infection,
so the number of infections is a lower bound on the number of contacts.
\ei
We use the assessments of doctors concerning who infected whom as a prior for who infected whom.
We state the prior in Section 8.2.}

}

\subsection{Model}

\alert{We use the semiparametric population model introduced in Sections \ref{parametric} and \ref{population.model},
assuming that $I_i - E_i$ and $R_i - I_i$ are independent Gamma$(\eta_{E,1},\, \eta_{E,2})$ and Gamma$(\eta_{I,1},\, \eta_{I,2})$ random variables,
respectively ($i = 1, \dots, 186$).
The priors of the epidemiological parameters are given by $\eta_{E,1} \sim \text{Uniform}(4,\, 8)$, $\eta_{E,2} \sim \text{Uniform}(.75,\, 3)$, $\eta_{I,1} \sim \text{Uniform}(1.5,\, 8)$, $\eta_{I,2} \sim  \text{Uniform}(2.5,\, 7.5)$, and $\beta \sim \text{Uniform}(.1,\, 8)$,
which cover a range of plausible values \citep[see, e.g., the discussions of][]{GrWeHu10,GrWeHu11}.
The degree parameters $\theta_1, \dots, \theta_{186}$ are assumed to have been generated by a Dirichlet process prior with concentration parameter $\alpha$ and base distribution $N(\mu,\, \sigma^2)$. 
To express the uncertainty about the concentration parameter $\alpha$ and the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ of the base distribution,
we assume that the hyperparameters $\alpha$, $\mu$, and $1/\sigma^{2}$ have Gamma$(5,\, 1)$,
% (with mean $5$ and variance $5$),
$N(0,\, 1)$,
% (with mean $0$ and variance $1$),
and Gamma$(1,\, 10)$ hyperpriors,
% (with mean $1$ and variance $1/10$), 
respectively.
To facilitate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior distribution,
we truncate the Dirichlet process prior at $K=3$ as described in Section \ref{truncation}.
We choose $K=3$ because we expect two subpopulations,
one corresponding to potential superspreaders and one corresponding to all other population members,
and $K=3$ is a convenient upper bound on the number of subpopulations.

\alert{Figure \ref{posterior.class} shows the posterior classification probabilities of population members along with the transmissions of MERS according to the assessments of doctors.
According to doctors,
181 out of the 186 infected population members are suspected of having infected 0, 1, or 2 other population members,
while 5 population members are believed to have infected more than 2 other population members:
1 (infected 30 others); 
14 (infected 70 others); 
15 (infected 6 others); 
16 (infected 23 others); 
and 76 (infected 10 others).
In total,
these 5 population members are believed to have infected 139 out of the 186 infected population members.
The posterior classification probabilities in Figure \ref{posterior.class} suggest that three subpopulations can be distinguished:
\bi
\item A subpopulation consisting of population members 1, 14, and 16,
which we represent by the color red in Figure \ref{posterior.class}.
Population member 1 was the first confirmed MERS case in South Korea and is believed to have infected population members 14 and 16.
These three population members are suspected of being responsible for the three largest clusters of infections,
infecting a total of 123 out of the 186 infected population members,
and may therefore be considered to be primary drivers of the MERS outbreak.
\item A subpopulation consisting of population members 15 and 76,
which we represent by the color orange in Figure \ref{posterior.class}.
Population member 76 (infected 10 others) belongs with high posterior probability to the orange-colored subpopulation,
whereas there is more uncertainty about the classification of population member 15 (infected 6 others).
Both of them are thought to be responsible for clusters of infections---albeit smaller clusters of infections than population members 1, 14, and 16---and may therefore be considered to be secondary drivers of the MERS outbreak.
\item A subpopulation consisting of all other population members,
which we represent by the color gray in Figure \ref{posterior.class}.
\ei
To gain insight into the propensities of population members to form contacts within and between these subpopulations,
we inspect the marginal posterior densities of the degree parameters $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, and $\gamma_3$.
The degree parameters $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, and $\gamma_3$ correspond to the red-,
orange-,
and gray-colored subpopulations in Figure \ref{posterior.class},
respectively.

Figure \ref{marginal.posteriors} shows Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations of the marginal posterior densities of $\gamma_1$,
$\gamma_2$,
and $\gamma_3$.
The 95\% posterior credible intervals of $\gamma_1$,
$\gamma_2$,
and $\gamma_3$ are given by $[.140,\, .959]$,
$[-2.575,\, 1.759]$,\;
and $[-2.587,\, -2.317]$,\;
respectively.
Since the log odds of the probability of a contact between two population members $i$ and $j$ is $\theta_i + \theta_j = \bZ_i^\top\, \bgamma + \bZ_j^\top\, \bgamma$,
members of the red-colored subpopulation have a high propensity to be in contact with other population members,
in particular other members of the red- and orange-colored subpopulations,
in addition to members of the gray-colored subpopulation.
It is worth noting that the posterior uncertainty---as measured by the lengths of the 95\% posterior credible intervals---is highest for $\gamma_2$ and lowest for $\gamma_3$, 
which makes sense because no more than 1 or 2 population members belong to the orange-colored subpopulation with degree parameter $\gamma_2$ (with a high posterior probability),
whereas 181 population members belong to the gray-colored subpopulation with degree parameter $\gamma_3$ (with a high posterior probability).
Taken together,
these results suggest that there were three to five potential superspreaders who may have had a great impact on the outcome of the MERS outbreak in South Korea.
These observations underscore the importance of detecting potential superspreaders.}

\section{Open questions and directions for future research}
\label{discussion}

We have introduced a semiparametric population model that can accommodate both short- and long-tailed degree distributions and detect potential superspreaders,
in addition to dealing with a wide range of missing and sample data.

Having said that,
many open questions remain.
Some of them are rooted in the lack of data,
while others stem from computational and statistical challenges arising from the lack of data and the complexity of the models.
We review a selection of open questions and directions for future research below.

\subsection{What is the population of interest?}

To analyze the MERS outbreak in South Korea,
we applied the proposed semiparametric modeling framework to the 186 infected population members.
In so doing,
we made the implicit assumption that the population of interest consists of those 186 infected population members.
There is no denying that such an assumption is unappealing.
In fact,
the assumption was motivated by convenience rather than substantive considerations,
including the challenge of determining the population of interest:
e.g.,
does the population of interest consist of all residents of South Korea,
all residents of East Asia,
or the whole world?

\subsection{Incomplete data}
\label{inc}

As pointed out before,
collecting complete data on population contact networks and epidemics is all but impossible.
As a consequence,
public health officials and researchers face a recurring question in the event of epidemics (whether outbreaks of coronaviruses such as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS, Ebola viruses, or other viruses): 
Which data to collect?
We believe that,
to learn the structure of a population contact networks and its impact on the spread of an infectious diseases,
 investigators should attempt to collect contact and epidemiological data on all infected population members and collect samples of contacts from non-infected population members by likelihood-ignorable sampling designs.
We discuss some of the challenges arising in practice along with possible solutions.

First,
while it is challenging to collect data on transmissions,
it is advisable to collect data that help reduce the posterior uncertainty about epidemiological parameters.
One possible source of data are viral genetic sequence data,
among other possible data sources.
We refer interested readers to \citet{beast} for a recent review of possible data sources.

Second,
it is prudent to sample from population contact networks to reduce the posterior uncertainty about network parameters.
The two likelihood-ignorable sampling designs discussed above can be used to do so,
though both require a sampling frame.
If no sampling frame is available,
an alternative would be respondent-driven sampling \citep[e.g.,][]{GiHa10,Gi11},
which is a form of link-tracing without a sampling frame.
Location data collected by mobile phones and other electronic sources would be alternative sources of data,
but raise data privacy issues \citep{FiSa10}.
In the past decade,
substantial progress has been made on data privacy in the statistical literature:
see,
e.g.,
the work of \citet{karwa2016inference} on data privacy in scenarios where network data are generated by the $\beta$-model (albeit without Dirichlet process priors and without epidemics).
Studying data privacy for epidemics would be an important direction of future research.

\subsection{Computational challenges arising from incomplete data}
\label{comp}

The lack of data has computational implications.
\alert{Statistical algorithms for likelihood-based statistical inference \citep*[e.g., EM algorithms,][]{DeLaRu77} have to integrate over the unobserved data,
hence the computing time tends to increase with the amount of missing data.}
How to develop scalable statistical algorithms,
with statistical guarantees, 
is an open question.
One idea would be to develop a two-step estimation algorithm,
first estimating the network parameters and then estimating the epidemiological parameters,
leveraging computational advances in the statistical analysis of network data \citep[e.g.,][]{RaNiHoYe12,STMu13} and epidemiological data \citep{beast}.
A two-step estimation algorithm may require data on contacts,
however,
because without data on contacts the posterior correlations of the network parameters and the rate of infection can be high \citep{GrWeHu10},
in which case two-step estimation algorithms may not work well.
A related problem is how to update posteriors in reasonable time as more data on infections and contacts come in.

\subsection{Non-ignorable incomplete-data generating processes}

We have considered here ignorable incomplete-data generating processes.
If the incomplete-data generating process is non-ignorable,
then either the incomplete-data generating process must be modeled or it must be demonstrated that Bayesian inference for the parameters of the population model is insensitive to the incomplete-data generating process.
Both approaches require insight into the incomplete-data generating process and may require additional model assumptions,
some of which may be untestable.
% see Heitjan slides

\subsection{Population models capturing additional network features}

We have focused here on the degrees of population members as network features,
but there are many other important network features:
e.g.,
if population contact networks exhibit closure \citep[e.g., transitive closure,][]{WsFk94,Ko09a},
then infectious diseases may spread rapidly within subpopulations but may spread only slowly through the whole population,
which has potential policy implications.
There are two broad approaches to capturing closure in population contact networks:
latent space models \citep*{HpRaHm01,HaRaTa07,SmAsCa19} and related latent variable models \citep*[e.g.,][]{latentspace,RaFrRa15,FoHo15,Ho18};
and exponential-family models of random graphs \citep*{FoSd86,SnPaRoHa04,ergm.book}.
Both classes of models can accommodate the degree terms we have used \citep*[see, e.g.,][]{KrHaRaHo07,thiemichen2016bayesian} along with additional terms that reward closure in population contact networks.
\alert{However,
both of them come at costs in terms of computing time \citep*[][]{BaBrSl11,ChDi11},
although the computing time depends on the class of models under consideration \citep*[see, e.g.,][]{karwa2016dergms}.}
In addition,
\citet{We11} pointed out that closure in population contact networks may not be detectable unless data on the population contact network are collected.
This,
too,
underscores the importance of collecting network data.

\subsection{Time-evolving population contact networks}
\label{temporal}

We have assumed that the population contact network is time-invariant,
motivated by the lack of data on the population contact network and the desire to keep the model as simple and parsimonious as possible.
In practice,
the population contact network may evolve over time,
because population members may create or discontinue contacts and because authorities may enforce social distancing measures.
As a consequence,
it would be natural to allow the population contact network to change over time.
Extensions to time-evolving population contact networks could be based on temporal stochastic block and latent space models \citep*[e.g.,][]{FuSoXi10,sewell2015latent,sewell2016latent,sewell2016model};
temporal exponential-family random graph models \citep*{RoPa01,HaFuXi10,ouzienko2011decoupled,KrHa10};
continuous-time Markov processes \citep{Sn01a};
relational event models \citep{Bu08};
and other models \citep[e.g.,][]{KaPr59,DuDu14,sewell2017network}.
An interesting approach to time-evolving population contact networks was recently introduced by \citet{Buetal21},
albeit without the ability to accommodate long-tailed degree distributions and detect potential superspreaders.
%\alert{That said,
%these models would likewise come at costs in terms of computing time (depending on the class of models under consideration),
%and would require samples of contacts over time.}

\eea
where
\bea
\nonumber
p(\bvartheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})
\;=\; \dfrac{p(\baa \mid \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bvartheta)\, p(\bvartheta)}{\int p(\baa \mid \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \bvartheta)\, p(\bvartheta) \dd \bvartheta}\s
\\
p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}}) = \dfrac{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\, p(\by \mid \btheta)\, p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}}{\sum_{\by_{\mbox{\tiny mis}}} \int\int\int p(\bx \mid \by,\, \bta)\, p(\by \mid \btheta)\, p(\bta,\, \btheta) \dd \bx_{\mbox{\tiny mis}} \dd \bta \dd \btheta},
\eea
which implies that the parameter $\bvartheta$ of the incomplete-data generating process and the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model are independent under the posterior.
