By construction of the model,
estimators of the epidemiological parameters $\eta_{E,1}$, $\eta_{E,2}$, $\eta_{I,1}$, and $\eta_{I,2}$ are not expected to be sensitive to $n$---which determines how much information is available about the network parameters---and the MSE of the posterior median and mean of $\eta_{E,1}$, $\eta_{E,2}$, $\eta_{I,1}$, and $\eta_{I,2}$ are indeed not sensitive to $n$ (not shown).
But Figure 4 demonstrates that samples of contacts do reduce the MSE of the posterior median and mean of $\beta$, $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, and $\gamma_3$:
The MSE turns out to be highest when $n = 0$,
%A sample of size $n=25$ results in a large reduction in MSE,
%and increasing $n$ tends to decrease the MSE.
and rapidly decreases as $n$ increases.
These observations underscore the importance of collecting data on contacts or functions of contacts,
such as degrees.
