{\em All infected population members visit hospitals,
which record data on contacts, transmissions, exposure, infectious, and removal times of infected population members.
To reduce the posterior uncertainty about the population contact network and its generating mechanism,
investigators generate a probability sample of non-infected population members from the subpopulation of all non-infected population members and collect data on the contacts of sampled population members,
rather than limiting the collection of data to infected population members visiting hospitals.}
