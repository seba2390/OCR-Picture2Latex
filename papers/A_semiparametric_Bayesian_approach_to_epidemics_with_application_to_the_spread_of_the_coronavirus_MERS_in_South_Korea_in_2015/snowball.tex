In the literature on network sampling \citep{Fr88b,ThFr00,GiHa06,HaGi09},
popular forms of link-tracing are snowball sampling \citep{Go61} and respondent-driven sampling \citep*{He97,SaHe04,GiHa10,Gi11,kurant.et.al:jsac:2011}.
Some of them do not generate probability samples in the strict sense of the word, 
but generate approximate probability samples \citep[e.g.,][]{Gi11}.
