The MERS data set does not include direct observations of transmissions or contacts,
but there are two sources of indirect observations:
\bi
\item The assessments of doctors of who infected whom.
\item The observed infectious and removal times,
which reveal when infected population members were infectious and,
in so doing, 
help narrow down the possible sources of infections.
\ei
Both of these sources help inform who infected whom and who was in contact with whom,
because an infection implies a contact.
