Last, 
but not least,
there is no evidence to suggest that the incomplete-data generating process is non-ignorable,
therefore we estimate the population model under the assumption that the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable.
It is worth noting that the assumption of ignorability is a strong assumption,
but it is convenient and defensible unless there is strong evidence to the contrary.
We discuss how to deal with non-ignorable incomplete-data generating processes in Section 9.4.
