Separating the complete-data generating process from the incomplete-data generating process paves the way for principled Bayesian inference based on incomplete data.

The following result shows that,
as long as the incomplete-data generating process is likelihood-ignorable,
% and the prior is proper,
Bayesian inference for the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model 
can be based on the marginal posterior $p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})$.
In other words,
the incomplete-data generating process can be ignored for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters $\bta$ and $\btheta$ of the population model,
because the marginal posterior $p(\bta,\, \btheta \mid \baa,\, \bx_{\mbox{\tiny obs}},\, \by_{\mbox{\tiny obs}})$ can be computed without requiring knowledge about the incomplete-data generating process.
% and its parameter $\bm\vartheta$,
% provided that the incomplete-data generating process is known to be ignorable.
% The result adapts a generic result of \citet{Ru76} to stochastic models of epidemics.
% Remark: \citet[][Section 8]{Ru76}.
