Data can be incomplete because transmissions, exposure, infectious, or removal times of infected population members are unobserved,
but many available data sets share one fundamental weakness:
There are no data on contacts among population members.
The lack of network data is all the more striking,
because collecting network data would help reduce the posterior uncertainty about
\bi
\item[(a)] the population contact network $\bY$,
which imposes hard constraints on how an infectious disease can spread,
because 
% for all pairs of population members $i$ and $j$,
$Y_{i,j}=0$ (no contact) implies  $T_{i,j} = T_{j,i} = 0$ (no transmission) with probability $1$;
\item[(b)] the parameter $\btheta$ of the population model that generated the population contact network $\bY$;
\item[(c)] possible sources of infections.
\ei
Advantages (a) and (b) may not be too surprising,
but advantage (c) may be less obvious.
To demonstrate that sampling contacts can reduce the uncertainty about possible sources of infections,
it is instructive to inspect the full conditional probability of the event that a population member $i$ infected a population member $j$,
assuming that both of them were infected during the course of the epidemic.
If $\varphi(\mbox{$i$ infected $j$})$ denotes the prior probability of the event that population member $i$ infected population member $j$,
then the conditional probability of the event that population member $i$ infected population member $j$,
given everything else, 
takes the form
\bea
\nonumber
\mbP(\mbox{$i$ infected $j$} \mid \bE,\, \bI,\, \bR,\, \bY=\by)
&=& \dfrac{y_{i,j}\; 1_{I_i < E_j < R_i}\; \varphi(\mbox{$i$ infected $j$})}{\sum_{h=1:\, h \neq j}^M\, y_{h,j}\; 1_{I_h < E_j < R_h}\; \varphi(\mbox{$h$ infected $j$})}.
\eea
If $y_{1,j}$, $\dots$, $y_{M,j}$ are observed,
then $y_{1,j}$, $\dots$, $y_{M,j}$ are fixed and impose hard constraints on who could have infected $j$:
If $i$ was not in contact with $j$ (that is, $y_{i,j}=0$),
$i$ could not have infected $j$.
By contrast,
if $y_{1,j}$, $\dots$, $y_{M,j}$ are unobserved,
then $y_{1,j}$, $\dots$, $y_{M,j}$ are not fixed and need to be inferred,
increasing the uncertainty about the possible sources of infection.
In other words,
observed contacts help narrow down the possible sources of infections and, in so doing, help reduce the uncertainty about possible sources of infections.
