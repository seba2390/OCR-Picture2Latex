    \caption{(a) Comparison of density histogram on $\mathcal{S}_u$ with the vanilla method and our method. (b) Comparison of density histogram on $\hat{\mathcal{F}}_u$ with the vanilla method, EIL, and consistency with attentive dropout. The analyzes are performed on the CUB-200-2011 test set using VGG16 as a backbone.}
