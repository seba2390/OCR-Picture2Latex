\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we find the gap between classification and localization by decomposing CAM from a new perspective. We claim that the misalignment between the feature vector at each location and class-specific weight causes CAM to be activated only in a small discriminative region.
To bridge this gap, we propose a method of aligning feature directions with class-specific weights. We also introduce a strategy to enhance the effect of feature direction alignment.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing WSOL methods by a large margin.

\noindent\textbf{Limitation.}
There are several hyperparameters to decide in our method. To alleviate the search burden, we discuss a rationale for hyperparameter selection.
