% a) modern programmable UI systems synthesize various types of incident waves by superimposing the weighted and delayed waves emitted by the individual elements of the planar transducer array
% coll:Jensen2002, Sect. 5: Spatial Impulse Responses / Sect. 5.3: Geometric Considerations
% - The calculation of the spatial impulse response assumes LINEARITY, and
%   any complex-shaped transducer can therefore be divided into smaller apertures, and
%   THE RESPONSE CAN BE FOUND BY ADDING THE RESPONSES FROM THE SUBAPERTURES. (p. 153)
% - The integral is, as mentioned before, a statement of Huygensâ€™ principle of summing contributions from all areas of the aperture. (p. 153)
% coll:Jensen2002, Sect. 5: Spatial Impulse Responses / Sect. 6: Fields from Array Transducers
% - MOST MODERN SCANNERS USE ARRAYS TO GENERATE AND RECEIVE THE ULTRASOUND FIELDS. (p. 159)
% - These FIELDS ARE QUITE SIMPLE TO CALCULATE, when the SPATIAL IMPULSE RESPONSE FOR A SINGLE ELEMENT IS KNOWN. (p. 159)
% - Since ULTRASOUND PROPAGATION IS ASSUMED TO BE LINEAR,
%   the INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL IMPULSE RESPONSES CAN SIMPLY BE ADDED. (p. 159)

% b) quasi-(d-1)-spherical waves reflect the anisotropic directivities of the vibrating faces and differ from the outgoing (d-1)-spherical waves induced by isotropic point sources
These quasi-$(d-1)$-spherical waves, which are referred to as

% 2.) randomization of the apodization weights and the time delays / random incident waves
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% a) highly probable satisfaction of the RIP by certain types of random sensing matrices motivates the randomization of the apodization weights and time delays
% article:Schiffner2018, Sect. II. Compressed Sensing in a Nutshell (sec:compressed_sensing)
% - Fortunately, CERTAIN TYPES OF RANDOM SENSING MATRICES \eqref{eqn:cs_math_prob_general_sensing_matrix} also obey
%   THE \ac{RIP} WITH VERY HIGH PROBABILITY, if
%   THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE \cite[6]{book:Foucart2013}, \cite{article:TroppPIEEE2010}.
% - Realizations of \ac{IID} random variables governed by certain distributions, e.g.
%   Gaussian or \name{Bernoulli}, as entries \cite[Thm. 5.2]{article:BaraniukCA2008} and
%   randomly and uniformly chosen scaled rows of a \name{Fourier} basis \cite[Thm. 3.3]{article:RudelsonCPAM2008}, for example, require
%   $M \in \bigomega{ s \ln( N / s ) }$ and
%   $M \in \bigomega{ s \ln^{4}( N ) }$ observations, respectively.
% - THESE ORDERS OF GROWTH ARE almost linear in $s$ and, thus, SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THAT GUARANTEED BY THE WORST-CASE COHERENCE.

% b) resulting random incident waves decorrelate the pulse echoes of the lossy heterogeneous object's admissible structural building blocks
% article:Schiffner2018, Sect. II. Compressed Sensing in a Nutshell (sec:compressed_sensing)
% - In medical imaging, the individual entries of the observation process and, in conjunction with the orthonormal basis, those of
%   the sensing matrix \eqref{eqn:cs_math_prob_general_sensing_matrix} depend on
%   the underlying physical model.
% - Various imaging parameters controlling the instrumentation, however, enable the systematic manipulation of groups of these entries within
%   technologically and physiologically tolerable limits.
% - The randomizations of these degrees of freedom generate sensing matrices \eqref{eqn:cs_math_prob_general_sensing_matrix} with
%   random structures that potentially improve the aforementioned characteristic measures and, consequently, aid in
%   meeting the associated sufficient conditions.

% - The EXCLUSIVE MODELING OF THE INCIDENT WAVES as
%   [1.)] STEERED \acp{PW} \cite{article:ProvostPMB2014,article:MaceITUFFC2013,article:MontaldoITUFFC2009} or
%   [2.)] outgoing $(d-1)$-spherical waves, $d \in \{ 2, 3 \}$, which originate from
%         single array elements \cite{article:JensenUlt2006} or
%         virtual sources \cite{article:ProvostPMB2014,article:PapadacciITUFFC2014,article:JensenUlt2006}, SIMPLIFIES
%   THE GEOMETRY AND ENSURES UNIQUE \acp{TOF}.
% - The RELATIVELY SIMPLE PHYSICAL MODELS are INACCURATE and cause SIGNIFICANT MISMATCHES in practical measurements.
% - The FINITE NUMBER OF EVENLY SPACED ARRAY ELEMENTS and their ANISOTROPIC DIRECTIVITIES, for example, prevent
%   the exact syntheses of
%   [1.)] NON-DIFFRACTING BEAMS, whose spatial extent and amount of transferred energy are unlimited, and
%   [2.)] outgoing $(d-1)$-spherical waves, whose isotropic sources are points.
% - The exclusive usage of

%   [2.)] outgoing cylindrical waves \cite{article:BessonITUFFC2018} ENTIRELY IGNORES
%   the PHYSICAL PROCESSES that enable the \ac{UI} system to SYNTHESIZE VARIOUS TYPES OF INCIDENT WAVES.

They strongly compress both

the acquisition time and
% 2.) data volume
the data volume of
a complete \ac{SA} acquisition sequence and potentially improve
the image recovery.
