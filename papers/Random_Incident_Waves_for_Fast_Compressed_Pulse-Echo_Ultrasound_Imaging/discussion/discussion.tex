% - The function of the Discussion is to INTERPRET YOUR RESULTS in light of
%   what was already known about the subject of the investigation, and
%   to EXPLAIN OUR NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM after taking your results into consideration.
% - The Discussion will always CONNECT TO THE INTRODUCTION by way of the question(s) or hypotheses you posed and the literature you cited
% - It tells how your study has moved us forward from the place you left us at the end of the Introduction.
% - Organize the Discussion to ADDRESS EACH OF THE EXPERIMENTS OR STUDIES FOR WHICH YOU PRESENTED RESULTS;
%   discuss each in the same sequence as presented in the Results, providing
%   your interpretation of what they mean in the larger context of the problem.
% - Do not waste entire sentences restating your results;
%   if you need to remind the reader of the result to be discussed,
%   use "bridge sentences" that relate the result to the interpretation:
% - Use subheadings, if need be, to help organize your presentation.
%   Be wary of mistaking the reiteration of a result for an interpretation, and make sure that
%   NO NEW RESULTS are presented here that rightly belong in the results.

% - Explaining the MEANING OF THE RESULTS to the reader is the purpose of the discussion section.
% - Why is the study important? How does this study relate to previous studies? What are the limitations of the study design?
% - Most important, always write the discussion for the reader
% - You should be trying to CONVINCE THE READER OF THE MERITS OF THE STUDY RESULTS.
% - State the study’s major findings
% - Explain the MEANING AND IMPORTANCE OF THE FINDINGS
% - Relate the findings to those of similar studies
% - Consider alternative explanations of the findings
% - State the clinical relevance of the findings
% - Acknowledge the study’s limitations
% - Make suggestions for further research
