% a) Fourier coefficients of the recorded RF voltage signals were determined first
The \name{Fourier} coefficients of
the recorded \ac{RF} voltage signals
\eqref{eqn:recovery_disc_freq_v_rx_Fourier_series_coef} were determined first.
% b) proposed method influenced the statistical properties of the additive errors in the linear algebraic system
The proposed method influenced
% 1.) statistical properties
the statistical properties of
% 2.) additive errors of bounded l2-norm
the additive errors in
% 3.) linear algebraic system (all pulse-echo measurements, multifrequent, all array elements, additive errors)
the linear algebraic system
\eqref{eqn:recovery_reg_prob_general_obs_trans_coef_error}.
% c) expected energies permit an estimate of the l2-norm of the normalized additive errors in the normalized CS problem
In
the absence of
any model inaccuracies,
% 1.) additive errors of bounded l2-norm:
%   \tnorm{ \vectsym{\eta} }{2} \leq \eta
% 2.) normalized additive errors of bounded l2-norm:
%   \bar{\vectsym{\eta}} = \vectsym{\eta} / \tnorm{ \vect{u}^{(\text{rx})} }{2}
% 3.) l2-norm of the normalized additive errors
%   \tnorm{ \bar{\vectsym{\eta}} }{2} = \tnorm{ \vectsym{\eta} }{2} / \tnorm{ \vect{u}^{(\text{rx})} }{2} \leq \bar{\eta} = \eta / \tnorm{ \vect{u}^{(\text{rx})} }{2}
the expected energies of both
% 1.) additive errors of bounded l2-norm
these errors and
% 2.) vector stacking the relevant Fourier coefficients of the recorded RF voltage signals (all pulse-echo measurements, multifrequent, all array elements)
the recorded \ac{RF} voltage signals
\eqref{eqn:recovery_sys_lin_eq_v_rx_born_all_f_all_in_v_rx} permitted
an estimate of
the $\ell_{2}$-norm of
% 3.) normalized additive errors of bounded l2-norm
the additive errors in
% 4.) normalized CS problem
the normalized \ac{CS} problem
\eqref{eqn:recovery_reg_norm_prob_general}.
% d) proposed method additionally requires an efficient implementation of the sparsity-promoting lq-minimization method
% g) auxiliary functions compose the FMM and a fast basis transform
Matrix-free compositions of
% 1.) fast multipole method for the observation process
the \ac{FMM} and
% 2.) fast basis transform for the nearly-sparse representation
a fast basis transform accelerated
% 3.) sparsity-promoting lq-minimization method
the sparsity-promoting $\ell_{q}$-minimization method
\eqref{eqn:recovery_reg_norm_lq_minimization}.

%Finally,
% 1.) discretized incident acoustic pressure fields [superpositions of quasi-(d-1)-spherical waves]
%the discretized incident acoustic pressure fields
