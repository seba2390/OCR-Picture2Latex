% 3. Digital wave atoms / 3.1. Implementation of wave atoms: 1D warmup
% - The complexity of each inverse FFT at scale j is O(j2^{j}), and there are O(2{j}) frequency bumps at scale j, indexed by m, so the total complexity is
%   [O( N * log(N) )] with N = 2^{2J}. (p. 377)
% - Likewise, the complexity of the inverse transform is O( N * log(N) ). (p. 378)
