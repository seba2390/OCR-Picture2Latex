% - The function of the Results section is to
%   OBJECTIVELY PRESENT YOUR KEY RESULTS,
%   WITHOUT INTERPRETATION, in an orderly and logical sequence using both
%   text and illustrative materials (Tables and Figures).
% - The results section ALWAYS BEGINS WITH TEXT, REPORTING THE KEY RESULTS and
%   REFERRING TO YOUR FIGURES AND TABLES AS YOU PROCEED.
% - The Results section should be ORGANIZED AROUND TABLES AND/OR FIGURES that
%   should be sequenced to present your key findings in a LOGICAL ORDER.
% - HIGHLIGHT THE EVIDENCE needed to answer the questions/hypotheses you investigated
% - TEXT:
%	- concisely and objectively
%	- use the ACTIVE VOICE as much as possible
%	- PAST TENSE
%	- DO NOT INTERPRET THE DATA HERE.
%
% How to refer to Tables and Figures from the text:
% - Use sentences that
%   DRAW THE READER'S ATTENTION TO
%   the RELATIONSHIP OR TREND YOU WISH TO HIGHLIGHT,
%   referring to the appropriate Figure or Table ONLY PARENTHETICALLY:
% - Avoid sentences that give no information other than directing the reader to the Figure or Table: (!!!)
% - Any Table or Figure you present must be
%   sufficiently clear, well-labeled, and described by its legend to be
%   understood by your intended audience without reading the results section, i.e.,
%   IT MUST BE ABLE TO STAND ALONE and be interpretable.
