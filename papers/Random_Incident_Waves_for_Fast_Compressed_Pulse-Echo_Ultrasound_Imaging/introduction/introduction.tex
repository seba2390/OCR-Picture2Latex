% - Conventional medical ultrasound imaging consists in
%   SCANNING A MEDIUM USING A SERIES OF SUCCESSIVE FOCUSED OR MULTI-FOCUSED BEAMS
%   SWEEPING ALONG THE REGION OF INTEREST. (p. 1853)
% - The RESULTING SCANLINES are then stacked together to reconstruct a single image. (p. 1853)
% - The time required to build one frame is thus proportional to
%   [1.)] the NUMBER OF GATHERED LINES and
%   [2.)] the MAXIMAL IMAGING DEPTH. (p. 1853)
% book:Bushberg2011, Chapter 14: Ultrasound / Sect. 14.6: Two-Dimensional Image Display and Storage
% - A 2D ultrasound image is acquired by
%   [1.)] SWEEPING A PULSED ULTRASOUND BEAM OVER THE VOLUME OF INTEREST and
%   [2.)] displaying echo signals using B-mode conversion of the A-mode signals. (p. 536)
% - The 2D image is PROGRESSIVELY BUILT UP or CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED as the beam is swept through the object. (p. 536)
% book:Bushberg2011, Chapter 14: Ultrasound / Sect. 14.6: Two-Dimensional Image Display and Storage / Electronic Scanning and Real-Time Display
% - State-of-the-art ultrasound scanners employ

%   [2.)] ELECTRONICALLY SWEEP AN ULTRASOUND BEAM ACROSS THE VOLUME OF INTEREST for dynamic ultrasound imaging. (p. 537)
% - FIGURE 14-31 Linear and curvilinear array transducers produce an image by activating
%   a SUBGROUP OF THE TRANSDUCER ELEMENTS that form one A-line of data in the scanned object and shifting
%   the active elements by one to acquire the next line of data. [...] (p. 538)
% - A SMALL GROUP OF ADJACENT ELEMENTS (~15 to 20) IS SIMULTANEOUSLY ACTIVATED TO CREATE AN ACTIVE TRANSDUCER AREA defined by
%   the width (sum of the individual element widths in the group) and the height of the elements. (p. 537)
% - A SHIFT OF ONE OR MORE TRANSDUCER ELEMENTS and
%   REPEATING THE SIMULTANEOUS EXCITATION OF THE GROUP PRODUCE THE NEXT A-LINE OF DATA. (p. 537)
% - Electronic delays within the subgroup of transducer elements allow transmit and dynamic receive focusing for improved lateral resolution with depth. (pp. 537, 538)
% - Phased-array transducers are typically comprised of a tightly grouped array of 64, 128, or 256 transducer elements in a 3- to 5-cm-wide enclosure. (p. 538)
% - ALL TRANSDUCER ELEMENTS ARE INVOLVED IN PRODUCING THE ULTRASOUND BEAM AND RECORDING THE RETURNING ECHOES. (p. 538)
% - The ultrasound beam is steered by adjusting the delays applied to the individual transducer elements by the beam former. (p. 538)
% - FIGURE 14-32 The phased-array transducer electronically steers the ultrasound beam by introducing phase delays during

%   Lateral focusing also occurs along the beam direction. A sector format composite image is produced (right), with
%   the number of A-lines dependent on several imaging factors discussed in the text. (p. 538)
% - A similar time-delay strategy (dynamic receive focusing) is used to spatially synchronize
%   the returning ultrasound echoes as they strike each transducer element (see Fig. 14-26). (p. 539)

%   A FULL IMAGE FROM A SINGLE TRANSMIT, thus offering the opportunity for ULTRAFAST IMAGING. (p. 1853)
% book:Szabo2013, Chapter 1: Introduction / Sect. 1.11: Conclusion
% - Unlike the relatively stable or incremental improvements of the other imaging modalities,
%   ULTRASOUND IS ACQUIRING SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED IMAGING CAPABILITIES in several areas due to
%   the SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES (see Table 1.1). (p. 34)
% - Diagnostic ultrasound continues to evolve by improving in
%   diagnostic capability, image quality, convenience, ease of use, image transfer and management, and portability. (p. 34)
% - The MOST DRAMATIC CHANGES have been through
%   [1.)] the CONTINUAL MINIATURIZATION OF ELECTRONICS in accordance with
%   [2.)] a MODIFIED MOORE'S LAW and NEW ARCHITECTURES. (p. 35)
% - SMALLER-SIZED COMPONENTS led to the first commercially available phased-array imaging systems as well as to
%   new, pocket imaging systems, which weigh less than 0.5 kg. (p. 35)
% - A REVISED MOORE'S LAW and recent VERTICAL CHIP INTEGRATION indicate that imminent manufacturing advances will bring
%   HIGHER CHIP COMPLEXITY IN SMALLER PACKAGES AND AT LOWER COSTS. (p. 35)
% - [1.)] NEW ARCHITECTURES such as those with GRAPHICAL PROCESSING UNITS and
%   [2.)] NEW IMAGING PARADIGMS are rapidly INCREASING SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTION and providing
%   more diagnostic information at greater speeds (see Chapters 10 and 11);
%   because of the time lag of technology implementation,
%   the latest developments have not had their full impact on ultrasound imaging. (p. 35)
% - The combination of

% article:BerthonPMB2018: Spatiotemporal matrix image formation for programmable ultrasound scanners
% 1. Introduction
% - For instance, ULTRAFAST ULTRASOUND IMAGING (UUI) is based on
%   the TRANSMISSION OF A SMALL NUMBER OF DEFOCUSED WAVES such as
%   [1.)] plane (Montaldo et al 2009),
%   [2.)] circular (Lockwood et al 1998, Nikolov and Jensen 2003, Couade et al 2009, Provost et al 2012, Papadacci et al 2014), or
%   [3.)] spherical diverging waves (Provost et al 2014) to
%   INSONIFY THE ENTIRE FIELD OF VIEW (FOV) AT EACH EMISSION. (p. 1)
% article:GarciaITUFFC2013: Stolt's f-k Migration for Plane Wave Ultrasound Imaging
% IV. Discussion
% - ULTRAFAST ULTRASOUND PWI, in comparison with the conventional focusing approaches,
%   ALLOWS ONE TO OBTAIN A FULL IMAGE WITH A SINGLE TRANSMIT by
%   migration of the resulting RF signals. (p. 1861)
% I. Introduction
% - Contrarily to conventional ultrasound imaging,
%   the frame rate reached by plane wave ultrasonography is only LIMITED BY THE TIME REQUIRED FOR A WAVE TO MAKE A TWO-WAY TRIP. (p. 1853)
% - Whereas focusing approaches concentrate the acoustic energy at one or several locations,
%   PLANE WAVE GENERATION TENDS TO MINIMIZE THE DIFFERENCES in amplitude and phase over the cross-section delimited by the wavefront. (p. 1853)

% - The propagation of shear waves was tracked in a phantom and used to characterize its stiffness. (p. L1)
% - 3D Ultrafast Doppler was used to obtain 3D maps of Pulsed Doppler, Color Doppler, and Power Doppler quantities in a single acquisition and revealed,
%   at thousands of volumes per second, the complex 3D flow patterns occurring in the ventricles of the human heart during an entire cardiac cycle, as well as

% - In the following, (15) of [27] will be generalized to include explicitly
%   VARIOUS TRANSMISSION SCHEMES such as
%   [1.)] MULTIPLE LIMITED-DIFFRACTION ARRAY BEAMS and
%   [2.)] STEERED PLANE WAVES. (p. 882)
% - Assuming that the TRANSMITTING TRANSFER FUNCTION OF THE TRANSDUCER is A(k) that includes both
%   [1.)] ELECTRICAL RESPONSE OF THE DRIVING CIRCUITS and
%   [2.)] ELECTRO-ACOUSTICAL COUPLING CHARACTERISTICS [79] of the transducer elements. (p. 882)
% - Then,
%   a broadband, limited-diffraction array beam [29], [32] or
%   pulsed steered plane wave (a plane wave is a special case of limited diffraction beams) incident on the object can be expressed as
%   [see (5) and (6) of [27] and their derivations from X waves [44], [45]]:
%   [27] article:LuITUFFC1997
%   [ \Phi_{Array}^{T}( \vect{r}_{0}, t ) = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 \pi } \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(k) H(k) e^{ j k_{x,T} x_{0} + j k_{y,T} y_{0} + j k_{z,T} z_{0} } e^{ - j \omega t } dk ], (1)
%   [...].
% - And f( \vect{r}_{0} ) is an object function that is related to the scattering strength of a scatterer at point \vect{r}_{0}. (p. 883)
% - It should be emphasized that (10) is also a 2-D Fourier transform of
%   the echo signals in terms of both x1 and y1 over
%   the transducer surface (aperture) [61], [62]. (p. 883)
% - Therefore, (13) indicates that (10) represents
%   a 2-D Fourier transform over the transducer surface for
%   echo signals produced from all point scatterers in the volume, V. (p. 884)
% - The phase and amplitude of each point source (scatterer) are modified by
%   the transmitted plane wave, (A(k)H(k)/c) e^{ j k_{x,T} x_{0} + j k_{y,T} y_{0} + j k_{z,T} z_{0} } [see (2)] as well as
%   the object function, f( \vect{r}_{0} ). (p. 884)
% - Thus, LIMITED-DIFFRACTION ARRAY BEAM WEIGHTING THEORY [27] IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS
%   A 3-D FOURIER TRANSFORMATION OF ECHO SIGNALS over both
%   the transducer aperture (2-D) and time (1-D), which
%   DECOMPOSES ECHO SIGNALS INTO PLANE WAVES or limited diffraction array beams [29], [32]. (p. 884)
% - The previous work [27], [28], [59], [60] on
%   the STEERED PLANE WAVES and
%   the LIMITED-DIFFRACTION ARRAY BEAM WEIGHTINGS IN TRANSMISSIONS is equivalent to
%   the PHASE AND AMPLITUDE MODIFICATIONS OF THE OBJECT FUNCTION shown in (13) or (10). (p. 884)
% - This proves that \tilde{R}_{kx+kxT ,ky+kyT ,kz+kzT}(ω) in (10) or (13) can be obtained directly by
%   3-D Fourier transform of
%   the received echo signals over a 2-D transducer aperture and 1-D time! (p. 884)
% - It can be shown from computer simulations and experiments in the later sections that
%   these approximations do not affect the quality of reconstructed images as compared to those obtained with
%   conventional, dynamically focused pulse-echo imaging systems. (p. 884)

% III. Relationships Between Fourier Domains of Echoes and Object Function / B. Image Reconstruction with Steered Plane Waves
% IV. Computer Simulation
% - Reconstructed images of the first object are shown in
%   Figs. 4 and 5 with limited-diffraction array beams and steered plane waves in transmissions, respectively. (p. 888)
% - In each figure, there are four panels for images reconstructed with
%   one transmission (up to 5500 frames/second with a speed of sound of 1540 m/s) [Figs. 4(a) and 5(a)],
%   11 transmissions (up to 500 frames/second) [Figs. 4(b) and 5(b)],
%   91 transmissions (up to 60 frames/second) [Figs. 4(c) and 5(c)], and
%   263 transmissions (up to 21 frames/second) [Figs. 4(d) and 5(d)], respectively, for a depth of 140 mm. (p. 888)
% - As a comparison,
%   panels Figs. 4(d) and 5(d) are the same and are obtained with
%   the CONVENTIONAL DELAY-AND-SUM METHOD with its transmission focus at 70 mm. (p. 888)
% - For 91 transmissions, it is seen from Figs. 4 and 5 that
%   image resolution is high and
%   sidelobe is low (images are log-compressed in 50 dB) for both
%   limited-diffraction array beam and
%   steered plane wave transmissions as compared to the conventional delay-and-sum method. (p. 888)
% - Even with one transmission,
%   the results are still comparable to that of delay-and-sum except near the transmission focal depth. (p. 888)
% - The results for limited-diffraction array beam and steered plane wave transmissions are similar, except
%   the former has a somewhat higher resolution. (p. 888)
% - Simulations with the second object are done to compare the image quality of both
%   limited-diffraction array beam and
%   steered plane wave transmissions with
%   the conventional delay-and-sum method of transmission focusing at all depths (dynamic transmission focusing) (Fig. 6). (p. 888)
% - It should be mentioned that both
%   limited-diffraction array beam and
%   steered plane wave methods have high computation efficiency due to the use of FFT
%   (the difference is on how to transmit — sine and cosine weighting are used to produce limited-diffraction array beams, and
%   linear-time delay is used to produce a steered plane wave). (p. 890)
% V. In Vitro and In Vivo Experiments
% - To test the extended HFR imaging theory in practical situations, both
%   in vitro and in vivo experiments are carried out with
%   a homemade HFR imaging system [62], [77], [78]. (p. 890)
% V. In Vitro and In Vivo Experiments / B. In Vitro Experiments
% - It is seen that, as the number of transmissions increases,
%   image contrast is increased significantly for both
%   limited-diffraction array beam and
%   steered plane wave transmissions. (p. 892)
% - Because the noise of the HFR imaging system is relatively high,
%   the contrast of cystic targets is lowered because the noise fills into the cystic areas. (p. 892)
% - This is more acute for limited-diffraction array beam transmissions in which
%   the sine or cosine weightings further reduce the transmission power by half [62]. (p. 892)
% V. In Vitro and In Vivo Experiments / C. In Vivo Experiments
% - From both Figs. 13 and 14, it is seen that
%   the steered plane wave with 91 transmissions produces images that
%   are better in both resolution and contrast than the conventional delay-and-sum method of a similar number of transmissions. (p. 892)
% - For the heart imaging, it is seen that the image quality can be traded off with frame rate. (p. 892)
% - Motion artifacts were a concern for
%   the extended HFR imaging theory when more than one transmission is used; however, from the in vivo heart images, it seems that
%   the extended theory is not very sensitive to the motion. (p. 892)
% - This is because the HFR imaging theory allows one transmission to reconstruct a complete image [27], i.e.,
%   the quality of each subimage is not affected by the motion, and
%   the heart does not move that fast to distort the image when subimages obtained from
%   different transmissions are superposed. (p. 892)
% VII. Conclusions
% - A HFR imaging theory was developed in 1997 [27], in which
%   a pulsed plane wave was used in transmission, and
%   limited-diffraction array beam weightings were applied to received echo signals to produce
%   a spatial Fourier transform of object function for 3-D image reconstruction. (p. 896)
% - In addition,
%   the use of steered plane waves in transmissions to increase image field of view and reduce speckle noises [27], [28], [59], [60] or
%   the use of limited-diffraction array beams [26], [29], [32] in transmission to increase field of view and spatial Fourier domain coverage to increase image resolution was suggested. (p. 896)
% - In this paper,
%   the HFR imaging theory was extended to include explicitly various transmission schemes such as
%   multiple limited-diffraction array beams and
%   steered plane waves [61], [62] (the first report was given in [61]). (p. 896)
% - Moreover, limited-diffraction array beam weightings of received echo signals over
%   a 2-D transducer aperture were proved to be the same as
%   a 2-D Fourier transform of these signals over the same aperture [61], [62]. (p. 896)
% - Because image frame rate is inversely proportional to
%   the number of transmissions used to obtain a single frame of image,
%   the extended theory provides a continuous compromise between image quality and frame rate. (p. 896)
% - This is desirable in applications in which HFR imaging is not crucial, such as
%   maging of livers and kidneys, high quality images can be reconstructed at the expense of image frame rate. (p. 896)
% - Both sim- ulations and experiments (in vitro and in vivo) show that the extended theory can be used to reconstruct high qual- ity images with little motion artifacts as compared to the conventional delay-and-sum method of a fixed transmis- sion focus as well as the delay-and-sum method that syn- thesizes its dynamic transmission focuses with a montage process. (p. 896)
% - Because the method can be implemented with the FFT that has very high computation efficiency,
%   imaging systems that use the method would be simplified greatly. (p. 896)
% - This is important for 3-D imaging with a fully populated 2-D array transducer in which
%   the computation efficiency and image frame rate are of paramount importance. (p. 896)

% II. Theory / A. The Single Plane Wave Imaging Mode
% - Because we do not have any focusing for the transmit beam,

% - Due to the complete data set, it is possible to have both

% 3. Introduction to synthetic aperture imaging
% - This data [received signals for all or part of the elements] can be used for making
%   A LOW RESOLUTION IMAGE, which is ONLY FOCUSED IN RECEIVE due to the un-focused transmission. (p. e6)
% - This [DAS in rx] is done for every point in the resulting image to yield
%   A LOW RESOLUTION IMAGE. (p. e7)
% - COMBINING THE LOW RESOLUTION IMAGES THEN RESULTS IN A HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGE, since
%   fully dynamic focusing has been performed for all points in the image. (p. e7)
% - The TRANSMIT FOCUSING is, thus, SYNTHESIZED BY COMBINING THE LOW RESOLUTION IMAGES, and
%   the focusing calculation makes the transmit focus DYNAMIC FOR ALL POINTS IN THE IMAGE. (p. e7)
% - The FOCUS is, therefore, BOTH DYNAMIC IN TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE and

% - Ultrasound PWI needs the WAVEFRONTS TO BE PLANAR AND TILTED with the desired incident angle. (p. 1863)

% c) popular DAS method focuses the echo signals on specified points in the FOV to quantify their echogeneity
% article:BessonITUFFC2018: Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging as an Inverse Problem: Matrix-Free Sparse Image Reconstruction
% Abstract
% - Conventional ultrasound (US) image reconstruction methods rely on
%   DELAY-AND-SUM (DAS) BEAMFORMING, which is
%   a RELATIVELY POOR SOLUTION to the image reconstruction problem. (p. 339)
% I. INTRODUCTION
% - Current real-time US imaging is GENERALLY BASED ON THE WELL-KNOWN DELAY-AND-SUM (DAS) BEAMFORMING ALGORITHM, which can be seen as
%   A BACKPROJECTION SOLUTION OF THE INVERSE PROBLEM under several assumptions [2]. (p. 339)
% - While being suitable for REAL-TIME IMAGING, DAS suffers from
%   [1.)] A RELATIVELY LOW QUALITY, in terms of SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, and requires
%   [2.)] SAMPLING THE ELEMENT RAW-DATA AT A RATE FEW TIMES HIGHER THAN THE NYQUIST RATE for
%         sufficient accuracy in the delay calculations [3], [4]. (p. 339)
% II. PARAMETRIC MATRIX-FREE FORMULATIONS OF THE MEASUREMENT MODEL AND ITS ADJOINT / B. Adjoint of the Proposed Measurement Model and Its Relationship With the Delay-and-Sum Algorithm
% - The DAS ALGORITHM IS THE STANDARD IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION METHOD employed in US imaging because of
%   its SIMPLICITY AND REAL-TIME CAPABILITY. (p. 341)
% - The DAS solution, while suited to real-time imaging, is therefore
%   A RELATIVELY POOR APPROXIMATION OF THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEM (2). (p. 341)
% - Indeed, DAS beamforming
%   [1.)] does not address the PROBLEM OF THE NOISE n,
%   [2.)] NEGLECTS PULSE SHAPE, and
%   [3.)] REQUIRES A SAMPLING RATE HIGHER THAN NYQUIST SAMPLING requirements because of the high-delay resolution required [3], [4]. (p. 341)
% - Indeed, to apply the delay defined in (13) digitally, received signals must be sampled on a sufficiently dense grid. (p. 341)
% article:BerthonPMB2018: Spatiotemporal matrix image formation for programmable ultrasound scanners
% 1. Introduction
% - The MOST COMMONLY USED APPROACH TO IMAGE FORMATION IN ULTRAFAST IMAGING is
%   the DELAY-AND-SUM (DAS) ALGORITHM, which is based on a number of GEOMETRICAL ASSUMPTIONS. (p. 1)
% article:MoghimiradITUFFC2016: Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound Fourier Beamformation Using Virtual Sources
% I. INTRODUCTION
% - Usually,
%   MEDICAL SYNTHETIC APERTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE PERFORMED USING DELAY-AND-SUM (DAS) BEAMFORMING IN
%   THE TIME DOMAIN [11]–[16]. (p. 2018)
% - This STRAIGHTFORWARD ALGORITHM IS QUITE TIME CONSUMING on general-purpose computers, due to
%   the LARGE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS. (p. 2018)
% - Starting with a MEDIUM REFLECTIVITY FUNCTION assumes that
%   superposition applies; and inverting the problem,
%   ALL THE BEAMFORMATION ALGORITHMS TRY TO RECONSTRUCT AN IMAGE USING ECHO SIGNALS. (p. 2018)
% - The SIMPLEST ALGORITHM IS DAS, which is based on
%   THE GEOMETRIC DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINT AND THE APERTURE. (p. 2018)
% - The algorithm [DAS] CAN BE USED WITH DIFFERENT ARRAY GEOMETRIES; however,
%   the NUMBER OF COMPUTATIONS IS HIGH because of point-by-point processing. (p. 2018)
% - In medical ultrasound imaging, however,
%   THE CLASSICAL TIME DOMAIN DAS METHOD IS STILL MORE POPULAR [14]–[16], [35], [36] than
%   the frequency domain algorithms. (p. 2019)
% VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
% - As previously mentioned,
%   SYNTHETIC APERTURE IMAGING in its classical form uses
%   DAS BEAMFORMATION WITH A HUGE COMPUTATIONAL LOAD due to the point-by-point processing protocol. (p. 2027)
% article:GarciaITUFFC2013: Stolt's f-k Migration for Plane Wave Ultrasound Imaging
% I. Introduction
% - In its SIMPLEST FORM,
%   MIGRATION BY SUMMATION OF TRACE AMPLITUDES ALONG HYPERBOLIC TRAJECTORIES (known as DIFFRACTION SUMMATION) has been
%   a basic tool for geophysicists since the 1950s [9]. (p. 1853)
% - This method has been EXTENSIVELY USED IN ULTRASOUND IMAGING under the name
%   DELAY-AND-SUM (DAS). (pp. 1853, 1854)
% IV. Discussion / A. Differences Among the Three Migration Methods
% 1) DAS:
% - The DAS IS ACTUALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE SO-CALLED DIFFRACTION SUMMATION,
%   the SIMPLEST MIGRATION METHOD used by the geophysicists since the 1960s [9]. (p. 1862)
% - This is a GEOMETRIC STRATEGY which consists of
%   SUMMING THE BACKSCATTERED SIGNALS ALONG THE HYPERBOLIC TRACES OF THE DIFFRACTION RESPONSES. (p. 1862)
% - The DAS THUS PROVIDES A BASIC SOLUTION OF THE MIGRATION PROBLEM. (p. 1862)
% - Although this procedure makes good sense and provides good outputs in plane wave imaging,
%   IT IS THEORETICALLY INCORRECT [29]. (p. 1862)
% - A more exact process would be, for instance, given by the KIRCHHOFF'S INTEGRAL THEOREM, which adds
%   AMPLITUDE AND PHASE CORRECTIONS to the data before summation [29], [41], [42]. (p. 1862)
The popular \ac{DAS} method, for example, focuses
% 1.) recorded RF voltage signals
the echo signals on
% 2.) specified points
specified points in
% 3.) field-of-view
the \ac{FOV} to quantify
% 4.) echogeneity
their echogeneity.
% d) popular DAS method adds the signal samples at the round-trip TOFs
% article:BerthonPMB2018: Spatiotemporal matrix image formation for programmable ultrasound scanners
% 1. Introduction
% - For a GIVEN INCIDENT WAVE, it [DAS ALGORITHM] consists in
%   [1.)] CALCULATING THE TIME OF FLIGHT associated to each pixel/element pair and
%   [2.)] SUMMING THE CORRESPONDING SIGNALS measured for the different elements to populate the image (Montaldo et al 2009). (p. 1)
% article:GarciaITUFFC2013: Stolt's f-k Migration for Plane Wave Ultrasound Imaging
% I. Introduction
% - The DAS simply consists in
%   INTEGRATING THE ULTRASOUND RF SIGNALS OVER
%   ALL THE HYPERBOLAS PRESENT IN THE RF SIGNALS. (p. 1854)
% - The PIXELS OF THE RESULTING MIGRATED RF IMAGE ARE THUS ASSIGNED THE INTEGRAL VALUES. (p. 1854)
% article:MontaldoITUFFC2009: Coherent plane-wave compounding for very high frame rate ultrasonography and transient elastography
% II. Theory / A. The Single Plane Wave Imaging Mode
% - Because we do not have any focusing for the transmit beam,
%   the IMAGE RESOLUTION IS OBTAINED ONLY BY A PARALLEL PROCESSING DURING THE RECEPTION MODE by
%   ADDING COHERENTLY THE ECHOES COMING FROM THE SAME SCATTER. (p. 491)
% - For a PLANE-PULSED WAVE, Fig. 1(b) shows that
%   the TRAVELING TIME to the point (x,z) and back to a transducer placed in x1 is given by
%   [ \tau( x_{1}, x, z ) = ( z + \sqrt{ z^{2} + ( x - x_{1} )^{2} } ) / c ], (1)
%   where c is the SPEED OF SOUND THAT WE ASSUMED TO BE CONSTANT IN THE MEDIUM. (p. 491)
% - Each point (x,z) of the image is obtained by ADDING COHERENTLY THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH SCATTER, i.e.,
%   [1.)] DELAYING THE RF(x1,t) SIGNALS BY τ(x1,x,z) and
%   [2.)] ADDING THEM IN THE ARRAY DIRECTION x1
%   [ s( x, z ) = \int_{ x - a }^{ x + a } RF( x_{1}, \tau( x_{1}, x, z ) ) d x_{1} ]. (2)
% - The aperture 2a must take into account only the elements that contribute to the signal. (p. 491)
% - This aperture 2a is always lower than the total length of the array L, and it can be expressed by the F-number defined as
%   [ F = z / 2a ]. (3) (p. 491, 492)
% II. Theory / B. The Coherent Plane Wave Compound
% - Then an image is obtained in the same way as shown in (2), but with
%   the NEW DELAYS FROM (6). (p. 493)
% article:JensenUlt2006: Synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging
% 3. Introduction to synthetic aperture imaging
% - Focusing is performed by
%   [1.)] FINDING THE GEOMETRIC DISTANCE from the transmitting element to the imaging point and back to the receiving element. (p. e7)
% - [2.)] DIVIDING THIS DISTANCE BY THE SPEED OF SOUND c gives the time instance t_{p}( i, j ) to
%   [3.)] TAKE OUT THE PROPER SIGNAL VALUE FOR SUMMATION. (p. e7)
% - For an image point \vect{r}_{p} THE TIME IS, thus:
%   [ t_{p}( i, j ) = \frac{ \norm{ \vect{r}_{p} - \vect{r}_{e}( i ) }{2} + \norm{ \vect{r}_{p} - \vect{r}_{r}( j ) }{2} }{ c } ] (4)
%   where \vect{r}_{e}( i ) denotes the position of the transmitting element i and \vect{r}_{r}( j ) the receiving element j’s position. (p. e7)
% - The FINAL FOCUSED SIGNAL y_{f}( \vect{r}_{p} ) is then:
%   [ y_{f}( \vect{r}_{p} ) = \sum_{ j = 1 }^{ N } \sum_{ i = 1 }^{ M } a( t_{p}( i, j ), i, j ) y_{r}( t_{p}( i, j ), i, j ) ] (5)
%   where y_{r}( t_{p}( i, j ), i, j ) is the received signal for emission i on element j,
%   a( t_{p}( i, j ), i, j ) is the weighting function (apodization) applied onto this signal,
%   N is the number of transducer elements, and M is the number of emissions. (p. e7)

% - The concept is based on
%   the FREQUENCY DOMAIN WAVENUMBER ALGORITHM FROM RADAR AND SONAR and is extended to
%   a multielement transmit/receive configuration using virtual sources. (p. 2018)
% - Window functions are used to extract the azimuth processing bandwidths and weight the data to reduce side lobes in the final image. (p. 2018)

%   PRESERVING THE QUALITY OF IMAGE AS DAS, while providing

% I. INTRODUCTION
% - There is still a tradeoff between the cost of the hardware and the processing time, especially in real-time imaging, 3-D imaging, and for
%   portable scanners. (p. 2018)
% - An alternative is Fourier domain algorithms, which use block processing instead of point-by-point processing. (p. 2018)
% - Range/Doppler is the first Fourier domain algorithm introduced and is shown step-by-step in Fig. 1 [20], [21]. (p. 2018)
% - The basic concept is that the coordinate transformation can put the data into a domain that is both
%   time- and spatial-wavenumber-dependent. (p. 2019)
% - An improved version is the wavenumber algorithm, which uses less approximations. (p. 2019)
% - It contains a 2-D Fourier transform to convert the data into the (ω, ku) domain,
%   a Stolt mapping algorithm to reshape the samples, and a phase correction to shift the data to the center of the domain. (p. 2019)
% - It is also called Stolt mapping, \Omega-K, or the range migration algorithm [22]. (p. 2019)
% - A new set of equations, therefore, have to be adapted for
%   Fourier beamformation of multielement transmission SA ultrasound imaging. (p. 2019)
% - In this paper, the block-processing wavenumber algorithm is adapted to
%   the medical field using a multistatic configuration with focused emissions assuming
%   a virtual source behind or in front of the transducer. (p. 2019)
% - Evaluations show that Fourier Beamformation Using Virtual Sources (FBV) can

% I. INTRODUCTION
% - Unlike medical applications,
%   most synthetic aperture implementations in the framework of SAR and SAS are processed using blockprocessing algorithms in

%   of point-by-point. (p. 2018)

% - In this section, the number of computations for the two methods, DAS and FBV, is calculated and compared. (p. 2023)
% - TABLE I NUMBER OF CALCULATIONS FOR DAS AND FBV (p. 2023)
% - Assume N \approx N_{r} and N_{e} N_{r} >> N, the order of calculation number for DAS to the FBV is approximately then
%   [ O_{DAS} / O_{FBV} = 23 N / ( 59 + 5 log_{2}( M N ) ) ] (31)
%   where O is used for “order of calculations.” (p. 2024)
% - For typical number of M × N = 2000 × 150, it shows that the FBV is about 23 times faster than DAS. (p. 2024)
% VI. RESULTS / C. Processing Time and Memory Usage
% - Assuming a simple implementation using 8-B double-precision numbers, and
%   having six data structures of size 1590 × 64 × 192 (corresponding to the phantom shown in Fig. 13) need
%   937 MB of memory to process the whole data set. (p. 2027)
% - The processing time ratio of DAS to FBV is of the order of 20, which is close to the theoretically estimated one of 23. (p. 2027)
% VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
% - In addition, the number of computations for two reconstruction methods, DAS, and FBV has been calculated. (p. 2028)
% - The ORDER OF THE CALCULATIONS IS ABOUT 20 TIMES SMALLER for FBV than DAS. (p. 2028)

% - It has been developed for SAR/SAS based on one-element transmission setup; however,
%   the medical ultrasound imaging is usually performed using focused emissions. (p. 2019)
% - Neglecting attenuation, which can be compensated using a time gain compensation, and assuming that superposition applies,
%   the received echo signal for each TX and RX pair is [28], [29], [32]
%   [ E( u_{rx}, u_{tx}, ω ) = P(ω) \int f(z,x) g( \rho_{in}, ω ) g( \rho_{out}, ω ) dz dx ] (1)
%   where E( u_{rx}, u_{tx}, ω ) denote the temporal spectrum of the received echo signal e( u_{rx}, u_{tx}, t ), and
%   P(ω) is the Fourier transform of the transmitted signal p(t). (p. 2020)
% - f(z, x) is the medium scattering function, which is estimated to form a final image.
% - g( \rho_{in}, ω ) and g( \rho_{out}, ω ) are the spatial responses for
%   the point scatterers in transmit and receive, based on the 2-D free-space Green’s function [28], [29], [32]

% - Although the collected data fill a rectangular block in (ω, ku) space, it corresponds to
%   a curved surface of constant temporal frequency, ω, in the (kz, kx ) wavenumber space of the image. (p. 2020)
% - To generate the image estimate from these data via the inverse FFT, the samples should be on a rectangular grid. (p. 2020)
% - The Stolt mapping is then used to interpolate the input samples onto a regular grid. (p. 2020)
% - A 2-D inverse Fourier transform from the interpolated data \hat{f}( k_{z}, k_{x} ) then gives the final image f(z, x). (p. 2020)
% - An inverse Fourier transform then provides an estimate of the medium reflectivity function. (p. 2023)

% - FFT-BASED BEAMFORMING for ultrasonic imaging has been the topic of
%   numerous studies since the early 1980s [12]–[19]. (p. 1854)
% - Most of them are based on the ANGULAR SPECTRUM METHOD, which consists in
%   DECOMPOSING THE REFLECTED WAVEFIELD INTO PLANE WAVES, each propagating at a different angle. (p. 1854)
% - Although originally derived for MONOCHROMATIC WAVES,
%   the ANGULAR SPECTRUM METHOD HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO WIDEBAND SYSTEMS [13], [14]. (p. 1854)
% - To reach very high frame rates,
%   an FFT-based reconstruction of ultrasound images obtained by plane wave insonifications has been successfully addressed by
%   J.-y. lu and his team [23]–[25]. (p. 1854)
%   [23] article:LuITUFFC1997, [24] article:LuITUFFC1998, [25] article:ChengITUFFC2006
% - In Lu’s method,
%   the RF image is essentially remapped in the Fourier domain by interpolating the temporal frequencies. (p. 1854)

% - Using one-element transmission limits the penetration depth, due to the low energy transmitted into the medium. (p. 2020)
% - Multielement transmission with focused virtual sources can increase the transmitted energy [13], [45]–[48]. (p. 2020)
% - There are two different placements of the virtual source location: in front of the transducer or behind it. (p. 2020)
% - These configurations have different properties and are chosen depending on the application [49]. (p. 2020)
% - For example, using a virtual source in front of the transducer provides
%   a higher transmitted energy especially in the focused point; however,
%   the energy spreading is not uniform close to the transducer, resulting in
%   some differences between the points above and below the focused point. (pp. 2020, 2021)

% Abstract
% - This technique [coherent plane-wave compounding], however,
%   REQUIRES LARGE COMPUTATIONAL LOADS MOTIVATING METHODS FOR SAMPLING AND PROCESSING RATE REDUCTION. (p. 1)
% I. INTRODUCTION
% - This method [coherent plane-wave compounding], however, is CHALLENGING due to
%   the HIGH DATA TRANSFER RATES AND LARGE COMPUTATIONAL LOAD. (p. 1)
% - To achieve ultrafast imaging,
%   ALL IMAGE LINES ARE COMPUTED IN PARALLEL, TYPICALLY ON A SOFTWARE BASED PLATFORM. (p. 1)
% - This implies that
%   SAMPLED RAW RADIO FREQUENCY SIGNALS, detected at each array element, are
%   DIRECTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE PROCESSING UNIT. (p. 1)
% - Each image line is obtained by STANDARD TIME DOMAIN BEAMFORMING, implying
%   SAMPLING RATES THAT ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN
%   THE NYQUIST RATE OF THE DETECTED SIGNALS. (p. 1)
% - Rates up to 4-10 TIMES THE CENTRAL FREQUENCY OF THE TRANSMITTED PULSE ARE USED in order to
%   eliminate artifacts caused by digital implementation of beamforming in time [4]. (p. 1)
%   [4] article:SteinbergITUFFC1992
% - Taking into account the number of transducer elements,
%   UP TO 10^{7} SAMPLES NEED TO BE TRANSFERRED AND DIGITALLY PROCESSED IN REAL TIME TO OBTAIN AN IMAGE. (p. 1)
% - THE PROCESSING UNIT, therefore, MUST BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR REAL TIME BEAMFORMING. (p. 1)
% - Therefore,
%   ALTERNATIVES FOR SAMPLING AND PROCESSING RATE REDUCTION ARE OF HIGH INTEREST and can
%   LEAD TO SIMPLER AND CHEAPER SYSTEMS. (p. 1)
% - They may also serve as a potential enabler for the concept of a wireless probe and remote processing [9]. (p. 1)
% REDUCTION OF DATA RATES
% - One approach to reduce sampling rate is by QUADRATURE SAMPLING [5]. (p. 1)
% - Here the signals are
%   [1.)] sampled at rates dictated by the RF (radio-frequency) Nyquist condition and then
%   [2.)] DIGITALLY DEMODULATED AND DECIMATED TO THE EFFECTIVE NYQUIST RATE defined by the SIGNALS BANDPASS BANDWIDTH. (p. 1)
% - Digital IQ demodulation and decimation require
%   [1.)] multiplication by complex exponentials and
%   [2.)] low-pass filtering of each sampled signal, thus
%   INCREASING THE OVERALL COMPUTATIONAL LOAD. (p. 1)
% - Moreover,
%   elastography, one of the main applications of ultrafast imaging, requires RF ultrasound data for tissue deformation calculations [6]–[8]. (p. 1; really?)

  %   [2.)]
  % - The second difference between sparse approximation and compressive sensing appears in
  %   the TARGETED ERROR ESTIMATES. (p. 18)

% - Indeed, in many medical imaging modalities,
%   the IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS AMOUNTS TO SOLVING A LINEAR INVERSE PROBLEM. (p. 339)
% 	- In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the image is reconstructed from k-space samples and the measurement model is an inverse Fourier transform [6]. (p. 339)
%	- In X-ray-computed tomography (CT), the sinogram is related to the measurements by the Beer–Lambert law, which can be expressed as a linear inverse problem in the discrete domain [7]. (p. 339)
% - Moreover, sparsity priors have been expressed for medical images. (p. 339)
%	- Lustig et al. [6] have exploited sparsity of MRI images in the wavelet domain and under the total-variation (TV) transform. (p. 339)

% I. INTRODUCTION
% - SR methods have raised a growing interest recently in US imaging. (p. 340)
% - They [SR methods] have also been used in the context of the compressed sensing (CS) framework. (p. 340)
% - Three main contributions are proposed in this paper. (p. 340)
% 	- First, parametric, fast, and matrix-free formulations of the measurement model and its adjoint are described for both
%	  PLANE-WAVE (PW) and DIVERGING-WAVE (DW) COMPOUNDING. (p. 340)
%	- Second, a fully parallel implementation of these formulations is included in an SR framework, resulting in
%	  HIGH-QUALITY IMAGING WITH NEAR REAL-TIME CAPABILITY AND NO MEMORY FOOTPRINT, paving the way to SR for 3-D US imaging. (p. 340)
%	- Finally, the proposed model is coupled with INNOVATIVE COMPRESSION STRATEGIES, which outperform existing compressed beamforming (CB) schemes [10], [12]. (p. 340)
% II. PARAMETRIC MATRIX-FREE FORMULATIONS OF THE MEASUREMENT MODEL AND ITS ADJOINT / C. Inverse Problem of Interest
% - In the literature, two different groups of image reconstruction methods may be distinguished, since they aim at solving two different problems. (p. 341)
% - The first group of methods can be denoted as REGULARIZED BEAMFORMING METHODS. (p. 341)
%	- They do not take into account the pulse-echo waveform and
%         retrieve a low-resolution estimate of the TRF γ, usually denoted as the RF image γ^{RF} [11], [12], [23], [24], [32], [33]. (pp. 341, 342)
%	- One reason for this choice resides in the fact that γ^{RF} preserves speckle information (due to the low resolution), which is of interest in many US applications. (p. 342)
% - The second group of methods aims at performing INVERSE SCATTERING, i.e., at retrieving the high-resolution TRF γ from the element raw-data [2], [10], [15]. (p. 342)
%	- This problem is far more complex, highly ill-posed, and usually requires more sophisticated models than the ones used for regularized beamforming methods. (p. 342)
% V. RESULTS:SPARSE REGULARIZATION FOR ENHANCED IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION / C. Reconstruction of the In Vivo Carotids
% - This illustrates the great potential of SR for reducing the number of insonifications required to reach a given image quality. (p. 345)
% V. RESULTS:SPARSE REGULARIZATION FOR ENHANCED IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION / E. Computation Times for Sparse Regularization
% - These timings are two to three orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods. (p. 346)
% - Indeed, in their latest work, David et al. [46] reported computation times between 3 and 5 min. (pp. 346, 347)
% - Szasz et al. [33] reported reconstruction times between 10 s and 1 min. (p. 347)
% VI. RESULTS:COMPRESSED BEAMFORMING / D. Reconstruction of the In Vivo Carotids
% - However, speckle areas, especially in the far-field, are not well retrieved by the proposed approach, resulting in
%   a darkening of the deepest part of Fig. 9(b) and (d). (p. 348)
% VIII. CONCLUSION
% - This paper presents novel parametric, fast, and matrix-free formulations of the measurement model and its adjoint in the context of ultrafast US imaging. (p. 351)
% - These formulations are included in an SR framework, which is used to achieve high-quality imaging three orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. (p. 351)
% - In addition, new undersampling strategies, more suited to CS than previous ones, are suggested and high-quality reconstruction with a low number of measurements is demonstrated. (p. 351)

% INTRODUCTION
% - Our work follows the concept central to compressive imaging: that of
%   PROJECTING THE OBJECT/IMAGE INFORMATION THROUGH A SET OF INCOHERENT FUNCTIONS ONTO A SINGLE MEASUREMENT. (p. 2)
% DISCUSSION
% - Our work differs in the fact that rather than focusing our ultrasound waves to a single point,
%   WE ENCODE THE WHOLE 3D VOLUME ONTO ONE SPATIOTEMPORAL VARYING ULTRASOUND FIELD, from which
%   we then reconstruct an image based on solving a linear signal model. (p. 8)
% - This has the advantage of requiring only a few measurements to image an entire 3D volume, in contrast to time-reversal work. (p. 8)
% - This difference in acquisition time is crucial for medical imaging where the object changes over time, for example, in a beating heart. (p. 8)

% a) SA imaging and compressed beamforming effectively reduced the high spatial and temporal sampling rates by factors ranging from 4 to 10 to the sub-Nyquist regime
% article:ChernyakovaITUFFC2018: Fourier-Domain Beamforming and Structure-Based Reconstruction for Plane-Wave Imaging
% Abstract
% - In this work we extend
%   the RECENTLY PROPOSED FREQUENCY DOMAIN BEAMFORMING (FDBF) framework to
%   PLANE-WAVE IMAGING. (p. 1)
% - Beamforming in frequency yields
%   the SAME IMAGE QUALITY while
%   using FEWER SAMPLES. (p. 1)
% - It achieves AT LEAST 4 FOLD SAMPLING AND PROCESSING RATE REDUCTION by avoiding
%   oversampling required by standard processing. (p. 1)
% - To further reduce the rate [sampling and processing] we exploit
%   the STRUCTURE OF THE BEAMFORMED SIGNAL and use COMPRESSED SENSING METHODS to
%   RECOVER THE BEAMFORMED SIGNAL from
%   its PARTIAL FREQUENCY DATA obtained at a SUB-NYQUIST RATE. (p. 1)
% - Our approach OBTAINS 10 FOLD RATE REDUCTION compared to standard time domain processing. (p. 1)
% I. INTRODUCTION
% - Thus, in most commercial systems today
%   the NUMBER OF TRANSMISSIONS IS DICTATED BY THE NUMBER OF SCANLINES comprising the image. (p. 1)
% - As a result, the frame rate is limited to several tens of frames per second which is insufficient for a number of applications including
%   echocardiography for heart motion analysis, 3D/4D imaging and elastography. (p. 1)
% - The key to frame rate improvement without compromising image quality is to
%   break the link between the number of transmissions and the number of scanlines. (p. 1)
% - An obvious way to reduce the number of transmissions is to insonify the entire scene with a pulsed plane-wave. (p. 1)
% - The image lines are then obtained in parallel from the acquired data by standard dynamic beamforming upon reception. (p. 1)
% - However, due to inherent lack of focusing upon transmission, this method suffers from reduced contrast and resolution. (p. 1)
% - One approach to overcome this limitation is by SEQUENTIAL TRANSMISSION OF SEVERAL TILTED PLANE-WAVES [3]. (p. 1)
%   [3] article:MontaldoITUFFC2009
% - The images obtained from each insonification are added coherently to yield a final compounded image. (p. 1)
% - The result is characterized by significantly improved resolution and contrast since
%   COHERENT COMPOUNDING EFFECTIVELY GENERATES A POSTERIORI SYNTHETIC FOCUSING IN THE TRANSMISSION [3]. (p. 1)
% FDBF
% - When all the beam’s Fourier coefficients within its bandwidth are computed,
%   the sampling and processing rates are equal to the effective Nyquist rate [10]. (p. 2)
% - In this case the oversampling required by time domain implementation of digital beamforming [4] is avoided leading to 4-10 fold rate reduction. (p. 2)
% - The beam in time is then recovered by an inverse Fourier transform. (p. 2)
% - When further rate reduction is required, only a subset of the beam’s Fourier coefficients is obtained, implying that
%   the detected signals are sampled and processed at a sub-Nyquist rate. (p. 2)
% - Recovery then relies on CS methods that exploit an appropriate model of the beam to compensate for the lack of frequency data. (p. 2)
% - Low-rate data acquisition is based on the ideas of Xampling [12], [24], [25], which
%   obtains the Fourier coefficients of individual detected signals from their low-rate samples. (p. 2)

% article:HolfortITUFFC2009: Broadband Minimum Variance Beamforming for Ultrasound Imaging
% V. Conclusions
% - An approach for near-field, ADAPTIVE BEAMFORMING OF BROADBAND DATA BASED ON THE MINIMUM VARIANCE (MV) BEAMFORMER has been proposed. (p. 323)
% - The method is validated using Field II simulated synthetic aperture (SA) data and PLANE WAVE (PW) DATA. (p. 323)
% - The performance of the MV beamformer is compared with the DS beamformer using boxcar and Hanning weights. (p. 323)
% - The adaptive subband beamformer provides
%   a SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RESOLUTION AND CONTRAST compared with the conventional beamformer, even when
%   USING A SINGLE EMISSION. (pp. 323, 324)
% - It is seen that the resolution does not increase significantly when averaging several single emission images for MV. (p. 324)
% - Thus, the MV beamformer introduces the possibility of imaging the entire region in a single emission using only a single emission. (p. 324)

% Abstract
% - We propose a new strategy to REDUCE THE NUMBER OF EMITTED PWs BY LEARNING A COMPOUNDING OPERATION FROM DATA, i.e.,
%   by TRAINING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK to reconstruct high-quality images using a small number of transmissions. (p. 1637)
% - We present experimental evidence that this approach is promising, as
%   WE WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY IMAGES FROM ONLY THREE PWs, competing in terms of CONTRAST RATIO AND LATERAL RESOLUTION with
%   the standard compounding of 31 PWs (10× speedup factor). (p. 1637)
