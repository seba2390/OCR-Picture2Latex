% I. Introduction
% - The paper by Gore and Leeman [1] is one of the first publications to have developed
%   a REALISTIC MODEL FOR ULTRASONIC BACKSCATTERING IN HUMAN TISSUE by assuming
%   WEAK SCATTERING and a windowed monochromatic separable incident pulse. (p. 549)
%   [1] article:GorePMB1977a: Ultrasonic backscattering from human tissue: A realistic model
% - A more thorough analysis was carried out by Jensen [2], who derived
%   the wave equation from first principles and solved it to obtain
%   an ANALYTIC EXPRESSION FOR THE BACKSCATTERED RADIO-FREQUENCY (RF) TRACE IN THE TIME DOMAIN. (p. 549)
%   [2] article:JensenJASA1991: A model for the propagation and scattering of ultrasound in tissue
% - OUR ANALYSIS HERE IS SIMILAR to the treatments by Gore and Leeman [1] and by Jensen [2]. (p. 549)
% - Like Jensen, OUR AIM IS TO EXPRESS
%   THE BACKSCATTERED RF TRACE as the result of
%   LINEARLY FILTERING A MAP OF THE ACOUSTIC INHOMOGENEITIES IN THE IMAGED REGION by
%   a TRANSFER FUNCTION DETERMINED BY THE GEOMETRY AND MECHANICS OF THE ULTRASONIC TRANSCEIVING PROBE. (p. 549)
% - We restrict ourselves to consider LINEAR WAVE PROPAGATION ONLY. (p. 549)

% Abstract
% - The integral solution to the wave equation is combined with
%   A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FIELD FROM TYPICAL TRANSDUCERS USED IN CLINICAL ULTRASOUND to yield
%   A MODEL FOR THE RECEIVED PULSE-ECHO PRESSURE FIELD. (p. 182)
% INTRODUCTION
% - Developing algorithms that take advantage of this sampling [transducer signa] necessitates
%   quantitative knowledge of the received pulse-echo pressure field. (p. 182)
% - The object of this paper is to DEVELOP SUCH A MODEL FOR THE RECEIVED PRESSURE FIELD. (p. 182)
% article:GorePMB1977a: Ultrasonic backscattering from human tissue: A realistic model
% 1. Introduction
% - For a true understanding of the ULTRASOUND-TISSUE INTERACTION,
%   [1.)] a PRECISE SPECIFICATION OF THE SCATTERING ELEMENTS IN TISSUE (A TISSUE MODEL) is important and
%   [2.)] a THEORETICAL TREATMENT such as that presented here can tell whether
%         a postulated tissue model may be CHARACTERIZED BY, or even reconstructed from, THE SCATTERING DATA. (p. 318)
% - It also indicates what EXPERIMENTS are, in fact, necessary, for unique tissue characterization but
%   the RELEVANCE OF THE MODEL TO HUMAN TISSUE (or rather, to the true scattering elements in that medium) CAN BE DEDUCED ONLY FROM
%   DIRECT OBSERVATIONS. (p. 318)
The proposed $d$-dimensional, $d \in \{ 2, 3 \}$, physical model uses
% 1.) interactions of arbitrary incident waves with the human body
% article:JensenJASA1991: A model for the propagation and scattering of ultrasound in tissue
% Abstract
% - Analytic expressions are found in the literature for a number of transducers, and
%   ANY TRANSDUCER EXCITATION CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MODEL. (p. 182)
% INTRODUCTION
% - NO RESTRICTIONS are enforced on the transducer geometry or its excitation, and
%   ANALYTIC EXPRESSIONS FOR A NUMBER OF GEOMETRIES CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MODEL. (p. 182)

%% d) proposed method linearizes the ISP based on the first Born approximation
%The paper linearizes
%the physical model based on
%the \name{Born} approximation
% e) complexity of the boundary conditions and the lack of accurate data justify their simplifying approximation by the half-space r_{d} > 0 bounded by a rigid baffle of
% book:Cobbold2006, Sect. 2.1.3: Bounded Region With No Internal Sources / Specifying the Green's Function
% - As noted earlier,
%   a SUITABLE GREEN'S FUNCTION MUST SATISFY THE HELMHOLTZ EQUATION AS WELL AS THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. (p. 105)
% - These requirements make it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain
%   an analytic form of the field distribution without making any approximations. (p. 105)
% - However, FOR SOME SIMPLE GEOMETRIC SHAPES, EXPRESSIONS CAN BE OBTAINED. (p. 105)
% - From (2.23) it can be seen that if either G or \partial G / \partial n is zero over the bounding surface, then
%   either \Phi or \partial \Phi / \partial n needs to be specified; in other words, it avoids the need for specifying both quantities, which
%   can lead to overspecification difficulties. (p. 105)
% - As will be seen, these two types of boundary conditions, as summarized in Table 2.1, are
%   GOOD APPROXIMATIONS FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT OCCUR IN PRACTICE. (p. 105)
% - We shall FIRST CONSIDER THE HOMOGENEOUS DIRICHLET CONDITION in which
%   G = 0 and \partial G / \partial n \neq 0 on the surface S_{0}. (p. 105)
% - This means that THE VELOCITY POTENTIAL \Phi MUST BE SPECIFIED THROUGHOUT S_{0}.
%   But because the pressure phasor is proportional to \Phi, this corresponds to
%   PRESCRIBING THE PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION. (pp. 105, 106)
% - In the SECOND TYPE OF BOUNDARY CONDITION \Phi = 0 and \partial \Phi / \partial n \neq 0, which is
%   THE HOMOGENEOUS NEUMANN CONDITION. (p. 106)
% - But \partial \Phi / \partial n is equal to the particle velocity phasor normal to the surface pointing inward, i.e.,
%   in the opposite direction to \tilde{\vect{n}}. Consequently,
%   THE NEUMANN CONDITION CORRESPONDS TO SPECIFYING
%   THE NORMAL COMPONENT OF THE PARTICLE VELOCITY ON THE SURFACE. (p. 106)
% - BOUNDARY CONDITIONS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES MAY ALSO BE PRESENT. (p. 106)
% book:Cobbold2006, Chapter 2: Theoretical Basis for Field Calculations
% - In the CLASSICAL APPROACH FOR LINEAR PROPAGATION,
%   a HOMOGENEOUS, ISOTROPIC, INVISCID FLUID is assumed and SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS are made in regard to
%   the BOUNDARY CONDITIONS. (p. 96)
% - TWO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS are considered, leading to TWO EQUATIONS that
%   DESCRIBE THE FIELD DISTRIBUTION in terms of SURFACE INTEGRALS OVER THE PRESCRIBED BOUNDARY. (p. 96)
% - They are commonly referred to as the RAYLEIGH-SOMMERFELD DIFFRACTION EQUATIONS. (p. 96)
% - Finally, although not described in this chapter, it should be noted that if the field region is divided into
%   a GRID OF SUFFICIENTLY FINE RESOLUTION, NUMERICAL METHODS provide a FLEXIBLE MEANS FOR DETERMINING THE FIELD. (pp. 96, 97)

% TODO: common model in the literature!
% a) temporal Fourier domain simplifies the mathematical formulation of the model and the inclusions of absorption and the bandpass character
% article:NgITUFFC2006: Modeling ultrasound imaging as a linear, shift-variant system
% III. The Wave Equation
% - To SIMPLIFY THE MATHEMATICS,
%   the WAVE EQUATION AND ITS SOLUTION WILL BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF ANGULAR FREQUENCY Ï‰ instead of time t;
%   although LESS INTUITIVE,
%   this representation has the advantage of IMPROVING NOTATIONAL CLARITY by reducing
%   convolutions in the time domain to multiplications in the frequency domain. (p. 550)
The temporal \name{Fourier} domain simplifies
% 1.) mathematical formulation of the model

the model and enables

% formulation as integral equation
% article:ChewITAP1997: Fast solution methods in electromagnetics
% III. INTEGRAL EQUATION SOLVERS
% - Integral equation solvers usually involve a SMALLER NUMBER OF UNKNOWNS than
%   differential equation solvers because ONLY THE INDUCED SOURCES ARE UNKNOWNS, whereas
%   in a differential equation, the field is the unknown. (p. 535)
% - The high-computational complexity of the aforementioned solution schemes precludes their application to
%   the analysis of scattering from large structures. (p. 535)

% book:Devaney2012, Chapter 6: Scattering theory / Sect. 6.7.1: The Born approximation
% - The PHILOSOPHY EMPLOYED IN THE BORN APPROXIMATION TO THE INVERSE SCATTERING PROBLEM is that
%   WE SEEK AN EXACT INVERSION to
%   an APPROXIMATE formulation of the (forward) scattering problem. (p. 256)
%	-> The Born approximation is considered as an exact formulation of the forward scattering problem
%	-> exact inversion of the Born approximation is sought
%	-> ASSUMPTION: Born approximation reflects the underlying physics exactly
% - alternative: seek approximate solutions to the exact LS integral equation (p. 256)
% 	-> The problem with the latter approach is that
%	   it can be addressed only by ad-hoc and, generally, numerically based inversion schemes and
%   	   does not lend itself to any SYSTEMATIC TREATMENT OF THE INVERSE PROBLEM. (p. 256)
% book:Devaney2012, Chapter 6: Scattering theory / Sect. 6.7.1: The Born approximation
% - The ADVANTAGE OF THE LINEARIZED BORN MODEL is that
%   we can employ a SYSTEMATIC PROCEDURE TO DEVELOP ANALYTIC INVERSION SCHEMES that [...]. (p. 256)
% book:Devaney2012, Chapter 6: Scattering theory
% - Fortunately,
%   IN MANY APPLICATIONS the LIPPMANN-SCHWINGER equation can be APPROXIMATELY LINEARIZED, thus
%   YIELDING AN APPROXIMATE LINEAR FORMULATION OF THE SCATTERING PROBLEM that effectively reduces it to
%   a SIMPLE RADIATION PROBLEM of the type treated in Chapter 2. (p. 230)
% book:Kak2001, Sect. 6.1: Diffracted Projections
% - There are NO DIRECT METHODS FOR SOLVING the problem of WAVE PROPAGATION in an INHOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM;
%   in practice, APPROXIMATE FORMALISMS ARE USED that
%   allow the THEORY OF HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM WAVE PROPAGATION to be used for
%   GENERATING SOLUTIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF WEAK INHOMOGENEITIES. (p. 204)
% - The better known among these approximate methods go under the names of BORN and RYTOV APPROXIMATIONS. (p. 204)
% article:DevaneyJASA1985: Variable density acoustic tomography
% - One way out of this difficulty [nonlinear inverse scattering problem] is to LINEARIZE THE PROBLEM.
