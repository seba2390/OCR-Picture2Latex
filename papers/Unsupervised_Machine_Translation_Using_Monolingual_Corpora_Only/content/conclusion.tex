\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}


We presented a new approach to neural machine translation where a translation model is learned using monolingual datasets only, without any alignment between sentences or documents. The principle of our approach is to start from a simple unsupervised word-by-word translation model, and to iteratively improve this model based on a reconstruction loss, and using a discriminator to align latent distributions of both the source and the target languages. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to learn effective translation models without any supervision of any sort.
