In this paper, we have proposed scalable algorithms for the GLB problem: $(i)$ for large time horizon $T$ and $(ii)$ for large number $N$ of arms.
%%% BEG
% For large time horizon $T$, unlike existing GLBs, our new algorithmic framework GLOC performs online computations to enjoy constant per-time-step space and time complexity.
% The regret bound of GLOC combined with a GLM-specialized version of ONS achieves a comparable regret bound to existing ones.
% For large number $N$ of arms, we proposed two new hash-amenable algorithms GLOC-TS and QGLOC, where QGLOC (regret bound $\tilde O(d^{5/4}T)$) achieves a better regret bound than GLOC-TS ($\tilde O(d^{3/2}T)$).
% We proposed L1 sampling for fast inner product computation that is more accurate than the existing state-of-the-art.

There exists a number of interesting future work.
First, we would like to extend the GLM rewards to the single index models~\cite{kalai09theisotron} so one does not need to know the function $\mu$ ahead of time under mild assumptions.
Second, closing the regret bound gap between QGLOC and GLOC without loosing hash-amenability would be interesting: i.e., develop a hash-amenable GLB algorithm with $O(d\sqrt{T})$ regret.
In this direction, a first attempt could be to design a hashing scheme that can directly solve~\eqref{eq:glocopt_ext} approximately.

%- 1. can we even avoid the projection step? this is iterative process. projection free methods can be useful
