%\section{A Note for The Reviewers}\label{defend}
We received some controversial critiques, among many positive comments, from FOCS'16 that we would like to respond to.
 \textit{''The complexity of the algorithm was seen as a minus and it was hard to get any new insights from it''}: such comments are very rarely (if ever) given especially in venues such as FOCS and STOC. Of course the solution is not trivial, nonetheless we do not believe it is fair to see this as a minus for a paper. In Section \ref{overview}, we clearly outline the algorithm, how it has been derived from previous works, and how it can be further improved to achieve better bounds.
 With regard to the presentation, we would like to note that we received positive feedback on an earlier version of the paper submitted to FOCS'16: \textit{''Although it is very complex, the authors make a good job in explaining the ideas and I like them."}. However, we further improved the presentation style (abstract, intro, and technical parts), based on the comments we received from other reviewers.
 Following on a comment on the applicability of our algorithms, we would like to note that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement. What makes the paper slightly hard to understand is the analysis of the algorithms. You can find an implemented version of the algorithms at \href{}{text}.
