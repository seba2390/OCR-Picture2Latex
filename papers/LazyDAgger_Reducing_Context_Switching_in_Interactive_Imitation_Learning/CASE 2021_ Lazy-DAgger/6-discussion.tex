\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}
We propose context switching between robot and human control as a metric for supervisor burden in interactive imitation learning and present \algname, an algorithm which can be used to efficiently learn tasks while reducing this switching. We evaluate \algname on 3 continuous control benchmark environments in MuJoCo, a fabric smoothing environment in simulation, and a fabric manipulation task with an ABB YuMi robot and find that \algname is able to improve task performance while reducing context switching between the learner and robot by up to 79\% over SafeDAgger. %\ashwin{update with final results}
% \db{briefly say something here about robot fleet?} 
In subsequent work, we investigate more intervention criteria and apply robot-gated interventions to controlling a fleet of robots, where context switching can negatively impact task throughput.
%In future work, we hope to further improve the robustness of the algorithm and apply it to various complex robotic manipulation tasks such as cable untangling and suturing. %\ashwin{update with final results}
%Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to perform formal user studies for \algname, and are excited to do this in future work. We will also explore applications and extensions of \algname towards human operators controlling robot fleets, in which the burden of context switching may be even more significant.
