He received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and the M.Sc. degree with a specialisation in Mechatronics from the Democritus University of Thrace, Greece, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. He also received his PhD in Computer Science from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2014. Before he joined Aarhus University, he held Postdoctoral Researcher positions at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and at Tampere University of Technology, Finland, where he was an Academy of Finland Postdoctoral Research Fellow. 

Dr. Iosifidis has contributed in more than twenty R\&D projects financed by EU, Finnish and Danish funding agencies and companies. He has (co-)authored 73 articles in international journals and 89 papers in international conferences proposing novel Machine Learning techniques and their application in a variety of problems. He is a Senior Member of IEEE since 2016, and he served as an Officer of the Finnish IEEE Signal Processing-Circuits and Systems Chapter during 2016-2018. He is currently a member of the EURASIP Technical Area Committee on Visual Information Processing, and serves as Area/Associate Editor in Neurocomputing, Signal Processing: Image Communications, IEEE Access and BMC Bioinformatics journals. He served as an Area Chair for IEEE ICIP-2018,2019,2020 and EUSIPCO-2019, Technical Program Committee Chair for IEEE ICASSP-2019, and he is the Publicity co-Chair of IEEE ICME-2021. His research interests focus on topics of neural networks and statistical machine learning finding applications in computer vision, financial engineering and graph mining problems.
