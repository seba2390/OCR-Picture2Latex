\section{Conclusions}\label{con}

We design a calculus for true concurrency (CTC). Indeed, we follow the way paved by Milner's famous CCS \cite{CCS} \cite{CC} for interleaving bisimulation.

Fortunately, based on the concepts for true concurrency, CTC has good properties modulo several kinds of strongly truly concurrent bisimulations and weakly truly concurrent bisimulations. These properties include monoid laws, static laws, new expansion law for strongly truly concurrent bisimulations, $\tau$ laws for weakly truly concurrent bisimulations, and full congruences for strongly and weakly truly concurrent bisimulations, and also unique solution for recursion.

CTC is a peer in true concurrency to CCS in interleaving bisimulation semantics. It can be used widely in verification of computer systems with a truly concurrent flavor.
