We presented 2D and 3D CNN models for generating a pelvic sCT from a T1-weighted MR image. In our study, both models successfully generated accurate sCTs for all 20 patients, with a maximum MAEs of 56.5 HU and 53.1 HU for the 2D and 3D models, respectively. Statistical results of 20 patients showed that the 3D model could generate sCTs with better overall MAE, bone DSC, and bone precision. The fast speed and accurate HU mapping of the proposed 2D and 3D CNN models make them promising tools for generating pelvic sCTs for MRI-only radiotherapy. Future work on dose calculation comparisons between the CT and sCT is required before clinical implementation.
