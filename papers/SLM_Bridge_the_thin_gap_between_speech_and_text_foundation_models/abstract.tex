We present a joint Speech and Language Model (SLM), a multitask, multilingual, and dual-modal model that takes advantage of pretrained foundational speech and language models. SLM freezes the pretrained foundation models to maximally preserves their capabilities, and only trains a simple adapter with just 1\% (156M) of the foundation models' parameters. This adaptation not only leads SLM to achieve strong performance on conventional tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST), but also unlocks the novel capability of zero-shot instruction-following for more diverse tasks. Given a speech input and a text instruction, SLM is able to perform unseen generation tasks including contextual biasing ASR using real-time context, dialog generation, speech continuation, and question answering. Our approach demonstrates that the representational gap between pretrained speech and language models is narrower than one would expect, and can be bridged by a simple adaptation mechanism. As a result, SLM is not only efficient to train, but also inherits strong capabilities already present in foundation models of different modalities.
