This work proposes DarKnight a unified inference and training platform that uses TEE to perform data obfuscation and uses GPU to perform linear operations on obfuscated data. DarKnight uses a novel matrix masking to prevent data exposure. We provide a rigorous proof that bounds DarKnight's information leakage using mutual information. We achieved the privacy of 1 bit leakage on a Megapixel image while using FP operations. 
We evaluated three different models and datasets to demonstrate considerable speedups with provably bounded data privacy leakage and also verifying the computational integrity from GPU. For large DNNs, we observe an average of $12X$ speedup for inference and $5.8X$ speedup for training without accuracy degradation over the baseline fully implemented inside TEE.
