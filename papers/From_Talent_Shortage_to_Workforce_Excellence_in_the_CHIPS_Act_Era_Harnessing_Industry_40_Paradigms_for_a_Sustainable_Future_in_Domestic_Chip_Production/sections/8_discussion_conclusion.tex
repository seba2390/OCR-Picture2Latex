\section{Conclusion}\label{sec8:discussion_and_conclusion}
Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the manufacturing industry with key capabilities in automation and AR/VR, which are currently not fully leveraged by the semiconductor industry. The developed future roadmaps paved the way for enhanced education, training, and employee experience through AR/VR as well as future streamlining of manufacturing processes through preventative/predictive maintenance, automated wafer/die quality control, and inspection of IC packaging for hardware assurance. Ultimately, this ensures a secure supply chain that upholds the U.S. in the global chip race amid the ongoing talent gap by employing the innovative potential of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing.  All of these emerging paradigms possess promising outcomes in transforming the future of semiconductor manufacturing and production as a long-term solution by supporting CHIPS Act's ongoing workforce development efforts towards building a strong talent pipeline to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity.
