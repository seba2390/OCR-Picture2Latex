\begin{abstract}
We investigate { the internal structure of the current sheet in the pulsar
wind within} force-free and two-fluid MHD approximations. Within the 
force-free approximation we obtain { general} asymptotic solution of the
Grad-Shafranov equation for quasi-spherical pulsar wind { up to the second
order in small parameter $\varepsilon = (\Omega r/c)^{-1}$. The solution allows an arbitrary latitudinal structure of the radial magnetic field, including that obtained in the numerical simulations of oblique rotators. 
%In particular, it can describe the latitudinal structure of the radial magnetic field obtained numerically for oblique rotator. 
It is also shown that the shape of the current sheet does not depend on the 
latitudinal structure.} 
For the internal region of the current sheet { outside the fast magnetosonic 
surface} where the force-free approximation is not valid we use two-fluid MHD approximation.  
{ Carrying out calculations in the 
comoving reference frame we succeed in determining intrinsic electric and magnetic fields 
of a sheet. It allows us to analyze time-dependent effects which were not investigated
up to now. In particular, we estimate} the efficiency of the particle 
acceleration inside the sheet. Finally, after investigating the motion of individual 
particles in the time-dependent current sheet, we find self-consistently the width of the 
sheet and its time evolution.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

Particle acceleration in compact astrophysical objects is the classical
problem of modern astrophysics. Indeed, high energy radiation in the GeV
and even TeV energy band is the smoking gun of the existence of the relativistic
particles with characteristic Lorentz-factors $\gamma$ up to $10^4$--$10^5$ 
\citep{2000PhRvL..85..912L, 2007A&A...464..235A}.

Radio pulsars are thought to be the most effective accelerators in space.
Indeed, fast rotation of a neutron star (radius $R \sim 10$--$15$ km and
periods $P \sim 1$ s for ordinary pulsars) with surface magnetic field
$B_{0} \sim 10^{11}$--$10^{13}$ G (and even  $10^{13}$--$10^{15}$ G for
magnetars) inevitably results in the generation of the large enough electric
field $E \sim (\Omega R_{0}/c) B_{0}$. Here $\Omega = 2 \pi/P$ is the
neutron star angular velocity, and $R_{0}$ is the effective radius of the 
`central engine'; for radio pulsars $R_{0} \approx (\Omega R/c)^{1/2} R$
is the polar cap radius. The energetics of radio pulsars is determined by the
potential drop $V_{\rm tot} \sim e E R_{0}$.

To determine self-consistently the specific realization of the effective
particle acceleration, it is necessary to know in detail the structure of the
neutron star magnetosphere and the pulsar wind. Important analytical results
were already obtained in the first quarter of the century since radio pulsars
were discovered. In particular, the role of the process of the quantum-mechanical
particle creation was clarified~\citep{sturrock71, rs75, 1981ApJ...248.1099A}. 
It was shown the very possibility of the quasi-radial magnetized wind transporting 
electromagnetic energy to infinity~\citep{1973ApJ...180L.133M, 1975MNRAS.170..551B, 
1999A&A...349.1017B}. It was also predicted the full screening of magnetodipole 
radiation by plasma filling the neutron star magnetosphere~\citep{BGI}. Later 
these results were confirmed with numerical simulations of axisymmetric~\citep{ckf99, 
2006MNRAS.368.1055T, 2005PhRvL..94b1101G, 2006MNRAS.367...19K} as well as inclined 
magnetosphere~\citep{2012MNRAS.420.2793K, SashaMHD}.

As a result, at large enough distance from a neutron star $r \gg R_{\rm L}$
($R_{\rm L} = c/\Omega$ is the radius of the light cylinder) the theory predicts
the quasi-radial outflow of the relativistic electron-positron plasma along the
poloidal magnetic field. As the total flux of the magnetic field
through the whole sphere is to vanish, such a structure is to contain the current
sheet separating outgoing and ingoing magnetic fluxes. Up to the light cylinder the
energy is mainly transported by the electromagnetic field (i.e., by the flux of the
Poynting vector ${\bf S} = (c/4\pi){\boldsymbol E} \times {\boldsymbol B}$), but somewhere at larger
distances the electromagnetic energy flux is to be transferred into the particle energy.
Actually, the mechanism of this transformation is the main subject of the particle
acceleration theory. Up to now it remains the open question as the ideal MHD predicts
very ineffective particle acceleration for quasi-radial outflow~\citep{1994PASJ...46..123T, bes98}.

Clearly, for the MHD outflow to exist, the electric field ${\boldsymbol E}$ has to be smaller
 than the magnetic field ${\boldsymbol B}$. In the pulsar wind it can take place only if the
total electric current $I$ flowing in the magnetosphere (and producing toroidal
magnetic field $B_{\varphi}$) is large enough so that at the light cylinder the
toroidal magnetic field $B_{\varphi} \approx 2I/R_{\rm L}c$ becomes as large
as the electric field. Indeed, both $B_{\varphi}$ and $E$ diminish with
the distance as $r^{-1}$ (and, accordingly, $S \propto r^{-2}$). As the poloidal
magnetic field $B_{\rm p}$ for quasi-spherical structure decreases much faster
($B_{\rm p} \propto r^{-2}$), the very MHD approximation $E < B$ can be fulfilled
only if the total electric current  $I$ circulating in the pulsar magnetosphere is
as large as the so-called Goldreich-Julian current
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm GJ} = \pi R_{0}^2 j_{\rm GJ}^{\rm A},
\label{IGJ}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
j_{\rm GJ}^{\rm A} = \frac{\Omega B}{2 \pi}
\label{jGJA}
\end{equation}
is the amplitude of the Goldreich-Julian current density.

Here it is necessary to stress one important point. The definition of the Goldreich-Julian
charge density
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm GJ} = -\frac{\bf{\Omega} {\boldsymbol B}}{2 \pi c}
\label{rhoGJ}
\end{equation}
contains the factor $\cos \theta_{\rm m}$, where $\theta_{\rm m}$
is the angle between the vectors ${\bf \Omega}$ and ${\boldsymbol B}$. As a result,
for the condition (\ref{IGJ}) to be fulfilled for large enough inclination
angles $\chi$ between ${\bf \Omega}$ and the neutron star magnetic moment
${\bf m}$, the current density $j$ is to be larger than the local GJ current
density $j_{\rm GJ} = \rho_{\rm GJ} c$ near magnetic poles where 
$\theta_{\rm m} \sim \chi $, and
\begin{equation}
j_{\rm GJ} \approx \frac{3}{2} \, \frac{\Omega B}{2 \pi} \, \cos\theta.
\label{jjGJ}
\end{equation}

Thus, for quasi-radial MHD outflow to exist, the pair creation mechanism
has to support large enough longitudinal current $j > j_{\rm GJ}$ (\ref{jjGJ}).
At present, the most scientists believe in this model~\citep[see, e.g.,][]{2013MNRAS.429...20T},
and here we follow this point of view as well. On the other hand, effective
particle acceleration can be realized if the particle generation mechanism
cannot support large enough longitudinal current $j$. It can take place
in the vicinity of the so-called light surface $E = B$ which inevitable
appears outside the light cylinder for $j < j_{\rm GJ}$ ~\citep{BGI, 2000MNRAS.313..433B}.
Recently, the possible existence of such effective particle acceleration region was demonstrated by 
analyzing the TeV time-dependent radiation of the Crab pulsar~\citep{2012Natur.482..507A}.

Returning to standard model of the pulsar wind, let us recall that it contains `striped' 
current sheet separating ingoing and outgoing magnetic fluxes. This current sheet was predicted 
analytically~\citep{coroniti_striped_wind_1990, michel_pulsar_wind_1994, 1999A&A...349.1017B}
and later was confirmed in numerous force-free~\citep{ckf99, 2006ApJ...648L..51S, 2012MNRAS.420.2793K}, 
MHD~\citep{2006MNRAS.367...19K, 2009ApJ...699.1789T} and even PIC~\citep{2015MNRAS.448..606C}  
simulations\footnote{Nowhere any restrictions on the longitudinal current were imposed.}.
And it has long been understood that this current sheet can be the domain of very effective particle
acceleration~\citep{2001ApJ...547..437L,2007ApJ...670..702Z,2012SSRv..173..341A,2014ApJ...781...46C} 
On the other hand, self-consistent model of the internal structure of this 'striped' current sheet
was not constructed. 

The paper is organized as follows. We start with the discussion of force-free asymptotic 
behavior of the pulsar wind in Sect.~\ref{sect:rest}.  Here we obtain simple asymptotic 
solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation for quasi-spherical pulsar wind. { In 
particular, this solution can describe the latitudinal structure of the radial magnetic field obtained 
numerically for oblique rotator~\citep{2016MNRAS.457.3384T}}. We also show that the shape 
of the current sheet does not depend on the latitudinal structure. Then in Sect.~\ref{sect:fields} 
we determine the main properties of the internal regions of a current sheet where the force-free
approximation is not valid.  Using two-fluid MHD approximation and carrying out calculations 
in the comoving reference frame we determine electric and magnetic field structure as well as 
the velocity component perpendicular to the sheet. This allows us to estimate the efficiency 
of particle acceleration. After that we find the self-consistent solution for the current sheet evolution. 
Sect.~\ref{sect:IntStruct} is devoted to numerical simulation which, as will be shown, 
fully support our analytical asymptotic solutions. Finally, in Sect.~\ref{sect:conc} we discuss 
possible astrophysical applications of our consideration.

\section{Force-free asymptotic behavior of the pulsar wind}
\label{sect:rest}

\subsection{Basic equations}

In this section we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the pulsar wind
using well-known approach of the so-called \textit{pulsar equation}
~\citep{1973Ap&SS..24..289M, 1974MNRAS.167..457O}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-\left(1-\frac{\Omega_{\rm F}^2\varpi^2}{c^2}\right)\nabla^2\Psi
+2\frac{1}{\varpi}\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\varpi}
+\frac{\varpi^2\Omega_{\rm F}}{c^2}(\nabla\Psi)^2\frac{\mathrm{d}\Omega_{\rm F}}{\mathrm{d}\Psi}-
\\
-\frac{16\pi^2}{c^2}I\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}\Psi} = 0.
\label{G-SH}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This equation resulting directly from Maxwell equations
describes axisymmetric stationary electromagnetic fields
\begin{eqnarray}
\bm{E} & = & -\frac{\Omega_{\rm F}}{2\pi c}\nabla\Psi,
\label{fieldsE} \\
\bm{B} & = & \frac{\nabla\Psi\times {\bf e}_{\varphi}}{2\pi r\sin\theta}
-\frac{2I}{cr\sin\theta} {\bf e}_{\varphi}
\label{fieldsB}
\end{eqnarray}
within the force-free approximation. Here $\Psi=\Psi(r,\theta)$ is the magnetic
flux, and two integrals of motion $\Omega_{\rm F}=\Omega_{\rm F}(\Psi)$ 
and $I=I(\Psi)$ are the so-called field angular velocity (more exactly, the angular
velocity of a test charged particle drifting in the crossed electromagnetic fields) 
and the total current inside the magnetic tube respectively. Below for simplicity we  
consider the case $\Omega_{\rm F} = \Omega$ only. It corresponds to the fast enough 
rotation of the neutron star when the potential drop in the inner gap $V_{\rm gap}$ 
is much smaller than the maximum value $V_{\rm tot}$.

The first solution of the pulsar equation (\ref{G-SH}) containing radial wind
was obtained by \citet{1973ApJ...180L.133M}. He demonstrated that the `split 
monopole' magnetic field corresponding to magnetic flux
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi(r, \theta) & = & \Psi_{\rm tot}(1 - \cos\theta), \qquad \theta < \pi/2, \\
\Psi(r, \theta) & = & \Psi_{\rm tot}(1 + \cos\theta), \qquad \theta > \pi/2
\label{Michel}
\end{eqnarray}
is the exact solution of the pulsar equation if the additional relation
\begin{equation}
4 \pi I(\Psi) = \Omega_{\rm F} \left(2\Psi - \Psi^2/\Psi_{\rm tot}\right)
\label{EeqB1}
\end{equation}
holds. In this case
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{r} & = & B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}^2}{r^2} \, {\rm sign}(\cos\theta),
\label{m1973'} \\
B_{\varphi} & = & E_{\theta} = -B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\sin\theta 
\, {\rm sign}(\cos\theta),
\label{m1973}
\end{eqnarray}
where $B_{\rm L} = B_{\rm p}(R_{\rm L}, \pi/2)$. 
This solution describing the axisymmetric case is called the `split-monopole' one as it contains 
the current sheet in the equatorial plane separating ingoing and outgoing magnetic fluxes.

Later~\citet{1973ApJ...186..625I} has found more general asymptotic solution, i.e., 
the solution in the limit $r \rightarrow \infty$. He has shown that in this limit 
an arbitrary function $\Psi = \Psi(\theta)$ remains the solution of the pulsar 
equation (\ref{G-SH}) if
\begin{equation}
4 \pi I(\theta) = \Omega_{\rm F} \sin\theta \, \frac{{\rm d}\Psi}{{\rm d}\theta}.
\label{EeqB2}
\end{equation}
According to (\ref{fieldsB}), this implies that in the asymptotic limit
$r \rightarrow \infty$ any $\theta$-dependence of the poloidal magnetic field
$B_{\rm p} = B_{\rm p}(\theta)$ can be realized. Here we have to stress that 
relation (\ref{rhoGJ}) for charge density remains true for monopole structure 
(\ref{m1973'})--(\ref{m1973}) only. In general case
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm e} = -\frac{\Omega_{\rm F}}{4 \pi \sin\theta} \,
\frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{{\rm d}\Psi}{{\rm d}\theta}\right).
\end{equation}
As one can easily check using Eqns. (\ref{fieldsE})--(\ref{fieldsB}), both conditions 
(\ref{EeqB1}) and (\ref{EeqB2}) correspond to the clear relation $E_{\theta} = B_{\varphi}$.

Finally, it was found that the appropriate solution can be constructed for the oblique
rotator as well. According to~~\citet{1999A&A...349.1017B}, the `inclined split monopole'
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{\rm p} & = & B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}^2}{r^2} \, {\rm sign}(\Phi), \\
B_{\varphi} & = & E_{\theta} = -B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\sin\theta \, {\rm sign}(\Phi),
\label{b1999}
\end{eqnarray}
where now
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi = \cos\theta \cos\chi - \sin\theta \sin\chi \cos\left[\varphi - \Omega \left(t - r/c\right)\right],
\label{Phi}
\end{eqnarray}
and $\chi$ is the inclination angle, is the exact solution of the pulsar equation as well.
In the polar regions \mbox{$\theta < \pi/2 - \chi$} and \mbox{$\theta > \pi/2 + \chi$}
this solution coincides with the time-independent Michel solution (\ref{m1973'})--(\ref{m1973}),
but in the equatorial region $\pi/2 - \chi < \theta < \pi/2 + \chi$ all the field components
change the signs at the current sheet locating at the position $\Phi = 0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Asymptotic behavior}
\label{sect:Axis}

In this section we are going to generalize the solutions mentioned above to substantiate
the result of numerical simulation. Indeed, as was shown by~~\citet{SashaMHD}, for large enough
inclination angle $\chi > 30^{\circ}$ the $\varphi$-average poloidal magnetic field depends
on the angle $\theta$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle B_{\rm p} \rangle_{\varphi} \, \propto \, \sin\theta.
\label{Bpp}
\end{eqnarray}
For this reason, the structure of the solution with $\theta$-dependent poloidal magnetic field
(\ref{EeqB2}) is to be considered in more detail.

As we are mainly interested in the asymptotic behavior $r \gg R_{\rm L}$, one can search
a solution of the pulsar equation (\ref{G-SH}) in the form
\begin{equation}
\Psi(r,\theta) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\Psi_{n}(\theta)
\left(\dfrac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\right)^{2n}\mathrm{sign}(\cos\theta).
\label{dPsi}
\end{equation}
As was already stressed, the function $\Psi_{0}(\theta)$ describing the asymptotic 
magnetic field can be arbitrary if the condition (\ref{EeqB2})
$4 \pi I(\theta) = \Omega_{\rm F} \sin\theta \, {\rm d}\Psi_{0}/{\rm d}\theta$ holds.
According to (\ref{fieldsE})--(\ref{fieldsB}), we obtain in the zero approximation
\begin{eqnarray}
&&B_r  =  B_{\rm L}\left(\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\right)^2 \,
\frac{F(\theta)}{\sin\theta} \, \mathrm{sign}(\cos\theta),
\label{BRr} \\
&&B_{\varphi} =  E_{\theta} = -B_{\rm L}\frac{R_s}{r}F(\theta) \mathrm{sign}(\cos\theta),
\label{Ett} \\
&&B_{\theta}  = E_{\varphi}=E_{r}=0,
\end{eqnarray}
where $F(\theta) = (4/\pi)\Psi_0'/\Psi_{\rm tot}$, $\Psi_{\rm tot}=\Psi_{0}(\pi/2)$, 
and primes indicate the $\theta$-derivatives, e.g., $\Psi_0' = {\rm d}\Psi_0/{\rm d}\theta$. 
%and $\Psi_{0}'' = {\rm d}^2\Psi_0/{\rm d}\theta^2$. 
The Michel monopole solution corresponds to $F(\theta) = \sin\theta$. As to equation for 
the first disturbance $\Psi_{1}(\theta)$, it looks like
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\theta}
\left(\sin\theta\frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi_1}{\mathrm{d}\theta}\right)
&- \left(\cot^2\th-3 +
 3\frac{F'}{F}\cot\theta+\frac{F''}{F}\right)\Psi_1 =\nonumber\\ 
&= \Psi_{\rm tot}\frac{1}{\sin\theta}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\theta}\left(\frac{F}{\sin\theta}\right).
\end{align}
In particular, for $F(\theta) = \sin\theta$ we obtain $\Psi_{1}(\theta) = 0$, i.e., 
pure radial flow. On the other hand, for $\Psi_{0}'(\theta) =\Psi_{\rm tot} \sin^2\theta$ (and, hence, 
$B_{r} \propto \sin\theta$) we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\theta}
\left(\sin\theta\frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi_1}{\mathrm{d}\theta}\right)
- \left(9\cot^2\th-5\right)\Psi_1
= 2\Psi_{\rm tot}\cot\theta.
\label{Psi1}
\end{eqnarray}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Oblique case}
%\label{sect:oblique}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig1-eps-converted-to.pdf}
\caption{The only solution  $\Psi_{1}(\theta)$ of equation (\ref{Psi1}) which has no singularity at $\theta = 0$ and \mbox{$\theta = \pi/2$}. The presence of finite solution implies that the disturbance of magnetic flux function decreases as $R^2_{\rm L}/r^2$.}
\label{fig:Ing}
\end{figure}

On Fig.~\ref{fig:Ing} we show the only solution $\Psi_{1}(\theta)$ of Eqn. (\ref{Psi1}) which 
has no singularity at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi/2$; these two conditions just determine 
the solution of this equation. As we see, this function is finite and, hence, the disturbance of the
radial poloidal magnetic field decreases as $R_{\rm L}^2/r^2$. We will use this property in what follows.

Now, to obtain the fields in oblique case we use the procedure similar to one
applied in~~\citet{1999A&A...349.1017B}. Instead of multiplying our axisymmetric solution by
${\rm Sign}(\cos\theta)$ we will multiply it by ${\rm sign}(\Phi)$. As one can easily check,
the appropriate fields satisfy Maxwell equations as well except for the current
sheet position $\Phi(r, \theta, \varphi) = 0$. Thus, one can conclude that the shape
of the current sheet does not depend on the latitudinal structure of the magnetic field.

Finally, using the definitions (\ref{BRr}) and (\ref{Ett}), one can obtain the
following very simple relation between the latitudinal structure of the radial
magnetic field $B_{r}(\theta)$ and the pulsar wind energy flux
$S(\theta)=cB_{\varphi}E_{\theta}/4\pi$ 
\begin{equation}
S(\theta) \propto \sin^2\theta B_{r}^2(\theta).
\end{equation}
The same expression for Pointing flux was also obtained by~\citet{2016MNRAS.457.3384T}. For $B_{r} =$ const we return to the expression $S(\theta) = \sin^2\theta$
which was widely used in the literature~\citep{2002AstL...28..373B, 2003MNRAS.344L..93K}.
On the other hand, for
$B_{r}(\theta)  \propto  \sin\theta$ we have
\begin{equation}
S(\theta) \propto \sin^4\theta,
\end{equation}
\\
i.e., exactly what was obtained numerically by~\citet{SashaMHD}. Of course, as in Eqn.
(\ref{Bpp}), it concerns $\varphi$-averaging values. Nevertheless, this result
implies that even very simple analytical consideration provide good enough description of
the main characteristics of the pulsar wind obtained numerically.

\section{Current sheet in the comoving reference frame}
\label{sect:fields}

\subsection{MHD approximation}

There are two reasons why the force-free model considered above is
too simple to describe the main properties of the current sheet. First, in
this model the sheet is infinitely thin. Second, within the force-free
approximation massless particles move with the velocity of light. As one
can see from (\ref{Phi}), the current sheet moves with the same velocity as
well, which prevents us considering in detail its internal structure.

For this reason below we try to pass to the reference frame comoving with the
outflowing plasma. It help us to separate the intrinsic processes inside the
current sheet from the common outflowing motion. Certainly, within the force-free
approximation this boost is impossible. For this reason in what follows we use
more general MHD approximation formulated in ~\citet{2000MNRAS.313..433B} 
\citep[see also][]{beszak04}.

Remember that to describe magnetically dominated MHD outflow it is very convenient
to introduce two dimensionless parameters, namely Michel magnetization parameter
$\sigma_{\rm M}$ and multiplicity parameter $\lambda$ ~\citep{2010mfca.book.....B}. Here
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\rm M} = \frac{e\Omega \Psi_{\rm tot}}{8 \pi \lambda m_{\rm e}c^3},
\label{sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_{\rm tot} = \Psi(\pi/2)$ is the total magnetic flux through the upper
hemisphere, and
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{n_{\rm e}}{n^{0}_{\rm GJ}},
\end{equation}
where $n^{0}_{\rm GJ} = \Omega B_{\rm p}/2\pi c |e|$ is the amplitude of the Goldreich-Julian 
number density. For ordinary pulsars \mbox{$\sigma_{\rm M} \sim 10^3$--$10^4$,} and 
$\lambda \sim 10^3$--$10^4$, and only for the fast young pulsars (Crab, Vela)
\mbox{$\sigma_{\rm M} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$,} and $\lambda \sim 10^4$--$10^5$. In the force-free 
limit $m_{\rm e} \rightarrow 0$ we have $\sigma_{\rm M} \rightarrow \infty$. On the other hand, 
for finite $\sigma_{\rm M}$ the particle velocity is smaller than that of light (see below). In 
addition, we suppose that the injection Lorentz-factor $\gamma_{\rm in} \sim 10^2$ is constant 
for all outflowing region.

As a result, according both to the theory~\citep{bes98, beam2015} and
numerical simulation~\citep{1999MNRAS.305..211B, 2006MNRAS.368.1717B},
the quasi-radial MHD flow is to intersect the fast magnetosonic surface at the distance
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm F} =  {\rm min}(\sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3} \sin^{-1/3}\theta, 
\sqrt{\sigma_{\rm M}/\gamma_{\rm in}}) \, R_{\rm L},
\label{rF}
\end{equation}
the Lorentz-factor at this surface being
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{\rm F} = {\rm max}(\sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3}\sin^{2/3}\theta, \gamma_{\rm in}).
\label{gF}
\end{equation}
For $\gamma_{\rm in} \gg \sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3}$ (slow rotation) it is necessary to use the
second expressions, while for  $\gamma_{\rm in} \ll \sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3}$ (fast rotation)
they realized in the narrow cone $\theta < \gamma_{\rm in}^{3/2}\sigma_{\rm M}^{-1/2}$ near
the rotational axis only; for most angles the first expressions are to be used.

It is very important that for both fast and slow rotation outside the fast magnetosonic
surface there are actually no collimation and particle acceleration. More exactly,
\begin{equation}
\gamma \approx \sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3}\sin^{2/3}\theta \log^{1/3}(r/r_{\rm F})
\end{equation}
for fast, and $\gamma_{\rm F} \approx \gamma_{\rm in}$ for slow 
rotation~\citep{1994PASJ...46..123T, bes98, beam2015}. This implies that 
with the logarithmic precision one can believe that at large 
distances $r \gg r_{\rm F}$ the particles move with constant 
velocity~\mbox{$v_{r} < c$} exactly corresponding to the drift 
velocity in~\mbox{$U_{\rm dr}/c = E/B$}~\citep{2009ApJ...699.1789T, 2010mfca.book.....B}. 
This property just helps us to move into the reference frame comoving with a particular 
part of the wind (at some constant $\theta$).

\subsection{Fields in the comoving reference frame}

\subsubsection{Introductory remarks}
\label{sect:rem}

As was already stressed, the first attempts in describing the internal structure 
of the `striped' pulsar wind were done by~\citet{coroniti_striped_wind_1990} and ~\citet{michel_pulsar_wind_1994}. They based their analysis on magnetic reconnection. 
%
%But they did not include into consideration radial dependence of toroidal magnetic and electric fields.
%Accordingly, Bogovalov solution (\ref{m1973'})--(\ref{m1973})
%corresponds to infinitely thin sheet and, hence, says nothing about its internal structure
%as well. In all cases it was rather difficult to separate the zero order electromagnetic
%fields resulting in general radial drift motion with the relativistic velocity $v \approx c$
%from the much smaller values which really control the internal structure of the current sheet.

The next step was made by~\citet{2001ApJ...547..437L} describing the internal structure 
of the moving current sheet by introducing `fast' and `slow' variables allowing to consider 
the current sheet moving radially with the velocity \mbox{$v_{\rm sh} < c$.} { But they 
did not consider internal structure of a sheet postulating actually zero magnetic field 
inside it.} Later, the following electromagnetic fields were considered~\citep{2013MNRAS.434.2636P}
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{r}(r, \theta, \varphi, t')   & = &   B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}^2}{r^2} \, 
\tanh\left(\dfrac{R_{\rm L}}{\Delta_{\rm lab}}\Phi_{1}\right), \\
B_{\varphi}(r, \theta, \varphi, t')  & = &   -\frac{B_{\rm L}}{\beta}
\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\sin\theta \, \tanh\left(\dfrac{R_{\rm L}}{\Delta_{\rm lab}}\Phi_{1}\right), \\
E_{\theta}(r, \theta, \varphi, t')   & = & = 
-B_{\rm L}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r}\sin\theta \, \tanh\left(\dfrac{R_{\rm L}}{\Delta_{\rm lab}}\Phi_{1}\right).
\label{b1999}
\end{eqnarray}
Here now
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_{1} =\cos\theta \cos\chi
- \sin\theta \sin\chi \cos\left[\varphi - \Omega \left(t' - r/\beta c\right)\right],
\label{Phi1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $t'$  is the time in the laboratory reference frame, $\beta = v_{\rm sh}/c <1$ and 
the fuction $\tanh(...)$ was taken for clear historical reason{\footnote{This function 
corresponds to well-known \citet{harris1962} solution.}} 
(this function can be arbitrary).

Unfortunately, these fields cannot be considered as good enough zeroth approximation as
they have no force-free limit inside the sheet with finite thickness. Indeed, as can
be easily checked, the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ dependencies of the function $\Phi_{1}$
(\ref{Phi1}) denies the existence of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ components of the current
density inside the sheet even in the force-free approximation. On the other hand, in
this limit $j_r = \rho_{\rm e}c$, and, hence, to support the components $j_{\theta}$
and $j_{\varphi}$ the particle velocity is to be larger than that of light. By the way,
~\citet{2001ApJ...547..437L} did not include into consideration the radial component of 
the Maxwell equation $\nabla \times {\boldsymbol B} = \dots$  (it was postulated that the radial
component of the current density $j_{r} = 0$ in spite of $[\nabla \times {\boldsymbol B}]_{r} \neq 0$),
so their analysis cannot be considered as self-consistent as well.

Here we present another approach to this problem { carrying out calculations 
in the reference frame moving radially with the current sheet}. It allows us to avoid the
leading components of electromagnetic fields resulting in the common drift motion.
Our consideration is based on the another exact force-free solution obtained 
by~\citet{2011PhRvD..83l4035L}
\begin{eqnarray}
&&B_r= B_{\rm L} \left(\frac{R_{\rm L}}{r} \right)^2;
\label{eqn2_1}\\
&&B_\vph= E_\th =-\frac{\b}{r} \sin \th f(r- c t'),
\label{eqn2_2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f(...)$ is again an arbitrary function. Having no dependence on $\theta$ and $\varphi$,
this fields are in agreement with the condition ${\boldsymbol j} = \rho_{\rm e}c \, {\bf e}_{r}$. We can
use this solution for inclined rotator because the shape of the current sheet in this case is
similar to the spherical wave, see, e.g.,~\citet{2012MNRAS.420.2793K}.

Of course, it is necessary to stress that this solution contains no sign change of the radial
component of the magnetic field $B_r$. On the other hand, as was already mentioned above, 
outside the fast magnetosonic surface $r \gg r_{\rm F} \sim \sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3} R_{\rm L}$ 
(\ref{rF}) both the disturbance of the monopole poloidal magnetic field resulting from the 
MHD disturbances~\citep{bes98} and the disturbances (\ref{dPsi}) connecting with 
$\theta$-dependence of the poloidal field have the same smallness $\sim \sigma_{\rm M}^{-2/3}$ 
at the fast surface and, hence, can be neglected.

For this reason, in what follows we put $B_r = 0$. As is well-known, this approximation is 
good enough outside the fast magnetosonic surface $r > r_{\rm F}$ and widely used in analysis 
of the pulsar wind~\citep{2001ApJ...547..437L, 2014PhRvD..89j3013B}. Indeed, according to 
(\ref{rF})--(\ref{gF}), for fast rotator in the comoving reference frame the toroidal 
magnetic field $B'_{\varphi} = B_{\varphi}/\gamma$ becomes larger than poloidal one 
$B'_{r} = B_{r}$ just outside the fast surface; for slow rotator it takes place even 
at smaller distances. 

As a result, we can modify now this solution for arbitrary
$\theta$-dependence of the poloidal magnetic field $B_{\rm r}(\theta)$ which, as was 
already stressed, better corresponds to the real structure of the pulsar wind.
For $f\equiv - \tanh$ the fields in the laboratory frame 
($r, \theta, \varphi, t^{\prime}$) can be presented as
\begin{eqnarray}
&&B_\vph (r, \theta, t') = \frac{1}{\beta} \frac{\b}{r} F(\theta) \td,
\label{F1}\\
&&E_\th (r, \theta, t') = \frac{\b}{r} F(\theta) \td\label{F2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta_{\rm lab}$ is a current sheet thickness in the laboratory reference frame, 
and $F(\theta)$ now is the arbitrary function. As was already stressed, the parameter 
$\beta = E_{\theta}/B_{\varphi}$ can be considered here as a constant.

%One of the key property of this solution is that the parameter $\beta$ can be considered 
%as $r$-independent. Indeed, as was shown by~\citep{1994PASJ...46..123T, bes98}, outside 
%the fast magnetosonic surface $r \gg r_{\rm F}$ both the disturbance of quasi-conical 
%magnetic surfaces and hydrodynamical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ increase very slowly; 
%$\propto \ln^{1/3}(r/r_{\rm F})$. Hence, in zero approximation the particle energy can 
%be considered as a constant alongradial magnetic field line. As for $r \gg r_{\rm F}$ 
%the particle energy is fully determinedby the drift 
%motion~\citep{2008MNRAS.388..551T, 2010mfca.book.....B}, one can put 
%$\beta = E_{\theta}/B_{\varphi} = $ const. 

Accordingly, the charge density in this frame is equal to Goldreich-Julian charge density:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\rm e} = 
- \frac{\b}{4\pi r^2 \sin \theta} \frac{{\rm d}[F(\theta)\sin\theta]}{{\rm d}\theta} \td 
=  n_{GJ \rm} e,
\end{equation}
but the current density is now equal to
\begin{equation}
j = \frac{\rho_{\rm e}}{\beta}.
\end{equation}
This implies that within the MHD approximation the velocities of electron and positron
components are to be different. For magnetically dominated case one can seek the first 
order corrections in the following form:
\begin{equation}
v_r^\pm/c = 1 - \xi_r^\pm;~v_\th^\pm/c=\xi_\th^\pm;~v_\vph^\pm /c= \xi_\vph^\pm.
\end{equation}
As the particle number densities can be now written as
\begin{equation}
n^\pm = n_{GJ\rm} \left[\lambda \mp \frac{1}{4} {\hat D}_{\theta}F(\theta) \right],
\end{equation}
where ${\hat D}_{\theta}F(\theta)=F'(\theta) + F(\theta)\cot\theta$ 
(e.g., ${\hat D}_{\theta} \sin\theta = 2 \cos\theta$),
one can obtain using the definition of the current density 
\mbox{$j = e n^+ v_r^+ - e n^- v_r^-$}
\begin{equation}
\xi_r^\pm = 1-\beta \pm \frac{1}{2 \lambda \gamma^2 \beta},
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
v_r^\pm/c = \beta \mp \frac{1}{2 \lambda \gamma^2 \beta}.
\end{equation}
Here $\gamma = (1-v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor and $\lambda$ again is the
multiplicity parameter. 
%Finally, using the general approach described in 
%Appendix A, one can find the following expression
%\begin{equation}
%|E_{\theta}|\simeq\beta|B_{\varphi}|
%\label{zeta}
%\end{equation}
%which can be applied outside the fast magnetosonic surface. As was already stressed, 
%toroidal magnetic field $B_{\varphi}$  is larger than the electric field $E_{\theta}$.

\subsubsection{Comoving reference frame --- orthogonal case}
\label{sect:cmframe}

As was already stressed, important property of the solution (\ref{F1})--(\ref{F2}) 
presented above is that the parameter $\beta$ can be considered as a constant. Thus, the
reference frame moving radially with the velocity $V = \beta c$ is the inertial one. 
In order to study the field structure in this reference frame moving with the current sheet,
we need to express the fields in Cartesian coordinates and make a Lorentz transform:
\begin{eqnarray}
B_x'=B_x;~B_y'=\Gamma (B_y+ \beta E_z);~B_z' = \Gamma (B_z - \beta E_y), \\
E_x'=E_x;~E_y'=\Gamma (E_y - \beta B_z);~E_z'=\Gamma(E_z+\beta B_y).
\end{eqnarray}
Here and below $\Gamma = (1-\beta^2)^{-1/2}$ is the boost Lorentz-factor, and the values 
without prime correspond to the reference frame moving radially with the $x$-axis  
directed along the radius-vector ${\bf e}_{r}$ and the $y$-axis along ${\bf e}_{\varphi}$ 
(see Fig.~\ref{Fig02}). As a result, near the origin of the reference frame moving radially with 
the velocity $V = \beta c$ (and for $f \equiv -\tanh$) the first order fields look like 
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{y}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{c t}
\left(1 - \frac{z^2}{c^2\,t^2}\right)
\tanh \left(\frac{x}{\Gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right),
\label{BYinitial} \\
E_{x}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L} z}{c^2t^2} \tanh
\left(\frac{x}{\Gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right).
\label{EXinitial}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $x = \Gamma(r-\beta c t')$, $t = t'/\Gamma$ is the time in the comoving 
reference frame, and
\begin{equation}
B_{0} = \frac{B_{\rm L}}{\beta^2 \Gamma^2} F(\theta),
\label{B00}
\end{equation}
which now can be considered as a constant. Note that this expression 
has $\Gamma^2$ instead of $\Gamma$ in denominator since $B_0$ actually
represents magnetic field at fast magnetosonic surface in comoving 
frame. Fast magnetosonic surface corresponds to the time 
$t_0' = R_{\rm F}/\beta c \Rightarrow t_0 \approx R_{\rm L}/c$.
{ Finally, as $z \ll ct$, we do not include below the factor
$(1 - z^2/c^{2}t^{2})$ into consideration.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{fig2-eps-converted-to.pdf}
\caption{Inertial reference frame ($x, y, z, t$) moving radially with velocity $V =\beta c$.}
\label{Fig02}
\end{figure}

Further, as one can directly check, Maxwell equation 
$c \nabla \times {\boldsymbol E} = - \partial {\boldsymbol B}/\partial t$ is automatically
fulfilled. Finally, for another Maxwell equation 
$c \nabla \times {\boldsymbol B} =  \partial {\boldsymbol E}/\partial t + 4 \pi {\boldsymbol j}$ to 
be valid, two-fluid MHD consideration is necessary. This question will be
considered in detail in Sect.~\ref{sect:IntStruct}. At the moment we only 
stress that the charge density along the boost axis (i.e., $x$-axis) is equal 
to zero, and the particle velocities after the Lorentz transform become
\begin{equation}
\frac{v_x^{\pm}}{c} = \mp \frac{1}{(2\lambda\pm 1) \beta}\approx \mp \frac{1}{2\lambda \beta}.
\end{equation}

Expressions (\ref{BYinitial})--(\ref{EXinitial}) are our main intermediate result 
giving zero approximation for the internal structure of the quasi-spherical 
current sheet in its comoving reference frame. As we see, this solution is
essentially time-dependent. Indeed, $r^{-1}$ diminishing of the toroidal 
magnetic field $B_{\varphi}$ in the pulsar wind transforms into $t^{-1}$ time
dependence in the comoving reference frame. As will be shown below, this results 
in a set of new effects which do not exist in classical time-independent
configurations.

%Corresponding to such fields velocities are:
%\be
%\xi^+_x = - \xi^-_x = - \frac{1}{4 \pi n e \Gamma\lambda} \frac{z}{t^3} \frac{\b \sin^m \th}{\Gamma^2 \beta^2}\tanh \left(\frac{x}{\Gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right);
%\ee
%\be
%\xi^+_z = - \xi^-_z =  \frac{1}{8 \pi n e \gamma^2\lambda\Delta_{\rm lab}} \frac{1}{t} \frac{\b \sin^m \th}{\gamma^2 \beta^2}\cosh^{-2} \left(\frac{x}{\gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right).
%\ee

\subsubsection{Comoving reference frame --- aligned case}
\label{sect:align}

Similarly, on can consider the internal structure of the current sheet for the
axisymmetric case when the current sheet locates in the equatorial plane. 
%Aligned case differs from orthogonal only in the form of the current sheet.
%For sheet located in the equatorial plane 
After passing into comoving reference frame (the calculations are quite similar 
to Section~\ref{sect:cmframe}) we obtain for the leading components of 
electromagnetic  field ($\theta = \pi/2$):
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{y}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0} \frac{R_{\rm L}}{ct} 
\tanh \left(\frac{z}{\Gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right), \\
E_{x}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0} \frac{R_{\rm L}z}{c^2 t^2} 
\tanh \left(\frac{z}{\Gamma \Delta_{\rm lab}} \right).
\end{eqnarray}
This fields differ from Eqns. (\ref{BYinitial})--(\ref{EXinitial}) by $z$
(not $x$) coordinate perpendicular to the sheet plane. 

It is necessary to stress that recent PIC simulations of the axisymmetric
pulsar magnetosphere~\citep{2015MNRAS.448..606C} demonstrate non-stationarity of the equatorial
sheet so that a high amplitude wave is generated just outside the light cylinder. 
In other words, axisymmetric equatorial sheet actually cannot exist. Nevertheless,
we consider this case as well.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Internal structure of time-dependent current sheet}
\label{sect:IntStruct}

In this section we discuss in detail the structure of electromagnetic fields 
and particle drift motion for time-dependent current sheet { not far 
from the fast magnetosonic surface. In this domain the time-dependent effects 
are most pronounced. Most of the section is devoted to discussion of orthogonal 
case, while aligned case is discussed in Appendix~\ref{Appendix.align}.}

{ In our analysis, we do not consider the important effects related to different instabilities (e.g., tearing and drift-kink) which can drastically disturb the structure of a sheet. The inclusion of these effects is beyond the scope of this study and we leave it for the following paper.}
%\cmtla{DONE I don't think we can neglect them. E.g. the rough estimate for the drift-kink instability growth rate is $\omega_{\rm B}^{-1}$ in the comoving frame. It means that the current sheet will move a distance less than a light cylinder (in the lab frame) before becoming unstable. The best thing we can do is saying that we understand it, but still want to solve simplified problem of stable sheet.} 

Note, that for simplicity we use $f(x) = \tanh(x)$ form of the current sheet 
(Harris sheet),  everywhere except for Sect. \ref{sect.A.E.F.}. The results 
can be easily applied to any physically reasonable form, i.e. odd function with 
\begin{equation}
\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty}f(x)\rightarrow \pm 1 
\nonumber
\end{equation}
and  $f(0)=0$. 

\subsection{Accelerating electric field}
\label{sect.A.E.F.}

As was already stressed, the solution (\ref{BYinitial})--(\ref{EXinitial}) 
constructed above corresponds to the constant width $\Delta_{\rm lab}$ of the current 
sheet separating time-dependent magnetic fluxes. To describe the time evolution 
of the  current sheet width $\Delta_{\rm lab}(t)$ (which is one of the main goals of this paper),
it is necessary to include into accelerating another component of the electric
field $E_{z}$.

To show this, it is convenient to rewrite the relations (\ref{BYinitial})--(\ref{EXinitial}) 
in the form
\begin{eqnarray}
B_{y}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{c t} h(x,t),
\label{BYin} \\
E_{x}(x, y, z, t) & = & B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L} z}{c^2 t^2} h(x,t).
\label{EXin}
\end{eqnarray}
where $h(x,t)=f[x/\Delta(t)]$. Then, we can rewrite Maxwell equation 
$c \nabla \times {\boldsymbol E} = - \partial {\boldsymbol B}/\partial t$  as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E_{z}}{\partial x} 
= B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{c^2 t} \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}. 
\end{equation}
It gives
\begin{equation}
E_{z}
= B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{c^2 t} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\int\limits^{x}_{\infty} h(x',t){\rm d}x'\right). 
\end{equation}
Further, as $f(x)$ and $h(x,t)$ are both odd functions of $x$, 
%$\int f(x) {\rm d} x$,
one can choose the integrating constant for $E_{z} \propto \int h(x',t){\rm d}x'$
to be even function with clear boundary conditions $E_{z}(\pm \infty) = 0$. Clearly, in this case 
we obtain $E_{z}(x=0)\neq 0$ near the center plane of the current sheet. Finally, Maxwell equation 
$c \nabla \times {\boldsymbol B} =  \partial {\boldsymbol E}/\partial t + 4 \pi {\boldsymbol j}$ 
now looks like
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ez}
B_{0}\frac{R_{\rm L}}{c t} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} 
= \frac{1}{c \, }\frac{\partial E_{z}}{\partial t} + \frac{4 \pi}{c} \, j_{\rm z}. 
\end{equation}
For Harris current sheet one can obtain the following expressions:
\begin{align}
B_{y} & =  B_{0} \frac{t_0}{t}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)},
\label{ByOrt}\\
E_{x}  & =   B_{0} \frac{t_0z}{ct^2}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)},
\label{ExOrt}\\
E_{z} & =  B_{0} \frac{t_0\Delta'(t)}{ct}\left\{\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right]-
\right. \label{EzOrt} \\
&- \left.\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right\}.
\notag
\end{align}

As we see, time-dependence of the current sheet thickness $\Delta(t)$ inevitably results in 
the appearance of the nonzero electric field $E_{z}$ along the sheet which is larger 
than magnetic one near the zero surface. Thus, the evolution of the current sheet
width and the problem of particle acceleration cannot be considered separately.

Acceleration of particles could be estimated from considering particles trapped deep inside 
the current sheet $x\ll \Delta$. For such particles, the change of $z$-component of momentum 
due to $E_z$ could be found from the solution of 
\begin{equation}
\dot p_z \approx e B_0 \frac{t_0 \Delta'(t)}{ct} \log(2),
\end{equation}
giving the acceleration
\begin{equation}
\delta p_z(t) = \int\limits_{t_0}^{t} \dot p_z {\rm d}t = \frac{\kappa \log(2)}{\kappa - 1} \frac{e B_0 \Delta_0}{c}[(t/t_0)^{\kappa -1} - 1].  
\label{eq:deltapz}
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta'(t) = {\rm d}\Delta/{\rm d} t$, and we assume power-law dependence 
for the current sheet thickness 
$\Delta(t) \propto t^\kappa$. Equation (\ref{eq:deltapz}) is valid for 
$\kappa \ne 1$. For $\kappa = 1$ integration (\ref{eq:deltapz}) gives 
logarithmic divergence. For such case we assume 
$\delta p_z \approx e B_0 \Delta_0/c = {\rm const}$. 
For $\kappa < 1$, $\delta p_z$ asymptotically goes to constant. In this 
case we also set $\delta p_z \approx e B_0 \Delta_0/c = {\rm const}$. 
On the other hand, for $\kappa > 1$ momentum grows as $t^{\kappa - 1}$
with time. Combining all the expressions, one can approximate the 
acceleration of particles in the current sheet as
\begin{align}
\delta p_z(t)  &= e B_0 \Delta_0/c, ~~~~\qquad \kappa \le 1 \label{eq:pz1}\\
\delta p_z(t)  &= e B(t) \Delta(t)/c, \qquad \kappa > 1 \label{eq:pz2}
\end{align}
where $B(t)$ is the value of magnetic field outside of the current sheet $B(t) = B_0 (t_0/t)$.

In Figure \ref{fig:p(t)}, expression (\ref{eq:deltapz}) is compared with the exact 
solution of particle equations of motion in the fields (\ref{ByOrt})--(\ref{EzOrt})
for different $\kappa$. The numerical solution is in good agreement with analytical 
prediction, except for $\kappa = 0.5$. The small difference between analytical and 
numerical solution in $\kappa = 0.5$ case is examined in Figure \ref{fig:p(x)}. 
All particles examined for this Figure start with $ z_0 = 0$, $v_x = 0$, 
$v_z = \omega_{\rm B}\Delta_0$ and with different initial $x_0$. An analytical value 
$\delta v_z = \log 2 \omega_{\rm B}\Delta_0$ corresponds to the limit of this curve 
at $x_0 \rightarrow 0$. For larger $x_0$, acceleration is larger, but stays order of
magnitude the same. We thus conclude that estimations (\ref{eq:pz1})--(\ref{eq:pz2})
are in good agreement with numerical solution.

outside the sheet until getting trapped, and the total change in velocity decreases.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Particle drift outside the current sheet}
  \label{part.drift}

{ In this section we discuss the main manifestations of time-dependent
effects in the proper reference frame of the current sheet. First of all,} in the 
comoving reference frame the particles experience drift motion outside the current 
sheet ($x \gg \Delta$ for orthogonal case and $z \gg \Delta$ for aligned case). The 
fastest component of such motion is $z$-component of electric drift 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn.drift.vel.}
    U_z = c\frac{E_x B_y}{B_y^2} = \frac{z}{t}.
\end{equation}
This velocity exactly corresponds to the radial divergence of the flow due to 
radial expansion. Since within our approximation $z \ll ct $, the drift velocity 
of particles remains non-relativistic.

The drift velocity $U_z$ is directed along the current sheet in orthogonal case, 
and out of the sheet in aligned case. For orthogonal case it implies that the 
particle, which is outside of the current sheet initially, will move along the 
sheet until it's orbit starts to intersect the midplane of the sheet. After 
this moment the particle is trapped and no longer drifts. On the other hand, 
for aligned case, particles drift away from the sheet. If current sheet expands 
slowly enough, such particles will never get trapped. Similarly, the particles, 
which are initially trapped might escape the sheet and start to drift with 
velocity $U_{\rm esc}^{\rm align} = \Delta(t_{\rm esc})/t_{\rm esc}$, where 
$t_{\rm esc}$ is the time when particle escapes the sheet. One can easily find 
that escape can only occurred if $\Delta(t)$ expands slower than linear.

As was shown in Sect.~\ref{sect.A.E.F.}, in orthogonal case the additional time 
dependence of a sheet width leads to additional electric field diminishing 
exponentially outside the sheet: $E_{\rm add}\propto\exp(-x/\Delta)$. Since for 
particles outside the sheet $\Delta\ll x$, we can neglect this electric field. 
The same remains true for gradient drift.
 
Further, Larmor radius of particles changes due to the conservation of the first 
adiabatic invariant $p_{\perp}^2/B_y \approx$ const. This connection allows 
us to evaluate the dependence of gyroradius on time (cf.~\citealt{2001ApJ...547..437L})
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn.L.R.}
\mathcal{R}_{\rm L}(t) = \mathcal{R}_{\rm L}(t_0)\left(\dfrac{t}{t_0}\right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
Such a dependence shows that the gradient drift (or any other drifts except electric) 
is not just significantly smaller than $z$-component of electric drift, but 
also smaller compared to Larmor radius growth. For orthogonal case 
Eqns. (\ref{eqn.drift.vel.}) and (\ref{eqn.L.R.}) indicate that any particle that 
initially is outside the sheet eventually gets trapped inside the sheet.

Now we can compare an average gyro-radius of particles with the thickness of sheet. 
If gyroradius of a particle is much smaller than the width 
of the current sheet, it is possible to use the drift approximation. The only component 
of the drift velocity having $x$-component is the electric drift 
\mbox{$U_{x} = -c E_{z}B_{y}/B^2$} 
\begin{equation}
U_{x} = -\Delta'(t)
\left\{\dfrac{\log\left[2\cosh( x/\Delta)\right]}{\tanh (x/\Delta)}  - x/\Delta\right\},
\label{eq:Ux}
\end{equation}
 In particular, for \mbox{$x \ll \Delta_0$} we have
\begin{equation}
U_{x} = -\log(2)\frac{\Delta'(t)\Delta(t)}{x}.
\end{equation}
Certainly, it is impossible to use this evaluation in the very center of a sheet $x \rightarrow 0$
where $E_{z} > B_{y}$.

As one can see, for $\Delta \gg {\cal R}_{\rm L}$, when there are a lot of particles 
with $\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \ll |x| < \Delta$ which do not cross the null surface, these 
particles will drift towards $x = 0$. This results in slow collapse of the sheet until 
the current sheet becomes thin enough so $\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \sim \Delta$.

On the other hand, it is impossible to sustain the Harris current sheet if 
$\mathcal{R}_L \gg \Delta$ as the particles in such a sheet spend most of 
their time in the region $|x| > \Delta$, i.e. outside of the sheet. This 
leads to the conclusion that in realistic current sheet
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \sim \Delta$.

\includegraphics[scale=1]{trapping-eps-converted-to.pdf}
\caption{Trapping of particles in the orthogonal current sheet for different starting 
positions outside the sheet. The points correspond to the positions of particles at 
the same moment in time. As $x$-positions of these points are close, the time until
particles get trapped is the same for particles with the same initial $x$.}
\label{fig:trap}
\end{figure}

{ Finally, time-dependence of the current sheet results in the trapping
of particles in the vicinity of the null surface. We illustrate this effect in
Figure~\ref{fig:trap} where we show} the trajectories of drifting particles outside the 
sheet. All particles start with the same velocity and $x_0$, but with different $z_0$. 
Points correspond to the positions of particles at the same moment in time showing that 
the time required for particle to get trapped is almost independent on $z_0$, and is 
determined by the $x$-component of drift velocity (\ref{eq:Ux}).

\subsection{Self-consistent solutions for non-relativistic particles}
\label{sect:solAn}

In this section we find exact solution for a particle trapped deep inside the orthogonal
current sheet $x \ll \Delta$. Surprisingly, the equations for non-relativistic particles 
could be integrated exactly. For relativistic particles not only equations could not be 
solved analytically, but also the actual approximation $x,z \ll ct$ breaks down and the 
fields (\ref{ByOrt})-(\ref{EzOrt}) could not be used.

In the orthogonal case we can use expressions (\ref{ByOrt})-(\ref{EzOrt}) for electromagnetic 
fields:
\begin{align}
B_y &= B_0 \frac{t_0}{t} \tanh\frac{x}{\Delta(t)},\\
E_x &= B_0\dfrac{t_0z}{ct^2} \tanh\frac{x}{\Delta(t)}\\
E_z &= \kappa \dfrac{B_0t_0\Delta(t)}{ct^2} 
\left\{\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right]-\right.\\
&-\left. \dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)} \tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right\},
\end{align}
where we again assume $\Delta(t)\propto t^{\kappa}$. After substitution these expression into equation 
of motion we obtain the following system of equations:
\begin{align}
\ddot{z} &= \dfrac{eB_0t_0}{m_{\rm e} c t}\left\{\dot{x}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}+\right.\\
&+\kappa\dfrac{\Delta(t)}{t}\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right]
-\left.\kappa\dfrac{x}{t}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right\},
\nonumber \\
\ddot{x} &= \dfrac{eB_0t_0}{m_{\rm e} ct^2}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}(z-\dot{z}t).\label{eq:ddotx}
\end{align}

Integrating now the first equation one can obtain
\begin{equation}
z-\dot{z}t=-\Delta(t)\Lambda\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right]+C
\label{zaz}
\end{equation}
corresponding to conversation of the following invariant 
\begin{equation}
I = m_{\rm e}z - P_{z}t.
\label{Iinv}
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda =  \omega_{B} t_0$ ($\omega_{B}= e B_0/m_{\rm e} c$ is cyclotron frequency),
and $P_z = p_z + e A_z$ is generalized momentum. This integral remains constant for non-relativistic 
case only. Further, substituting (\ref{zaz}) into (\ref{eq:ddotx}) we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.x.full.ort}
\ddot{x}=-\Lambda^2\frac{\Delta(t)}{t^2}\tanh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right].
\end{equation}
Here we neglect the constant $C$ in comparison with $\Delta(t)$ which is possible for expanding sheet.

To evaluate the asymptotic behaviour of nonlinear equation (\ref{eq.x.full.ort}) (which has 
no exact analytical solution) we present the coordinate $x(t)$ in the form $x(t) = \Delta(t)S(t)$ 
where $S(t)$ is a restricted function. After substituting this into equation (\ref{eq.x.full.ort}) 
we obtain
\begin{equation}
t^{2} S''+2 \kappa t S' + \kappa(\kappa-1)S
= -\Lambda^2\tanh S\log[2\cosh S],
\end{equation} 
where primes indicate derivatives over $t$. 

Expanding now r.h.s. into Maclaurin series (which is possible for $S \ll 1$) we obtain for the
leading term
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn.S.ort}
t^{2}S''+ 2\kappa t S' + \log (2) \Lambda^2S = 0.
\end{equation}
Here we suppose that $\Lambda \simeq 4\lambda\sigma_{\rm M} \gg 1$.
Equation (\ref{eqn.S.ort}) is linear and have the following solutions
\begin{equation}
\label{sol.S.ort}
S_{\pm} = S_0 \, t^{-(2\kappa-1)/2} 
\cos\left[\sqrt{\log (2)}\Lambda \log (t) + \varphi_{\pm}\right].
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{sol.S.ort2}
%K = \frac{2\kappa-1}{2}. 
%\end{equation}
As a result, it becomes clear that unless $\kappa\neq 1/2$ the expansion of the sheet 
doesn't follow the expansion of particle trajectory, for which we have
\begin{equation}
    x(t)\approx 
x_{0}\left(\frac{t}{t_0}\right)^{1/2}\cos\left[\alpha (x_0) \Lambda\log (t)
+\varphi_{0}\right]
\label{eq:orb_orth}
\end{equation}
for arbitrary oscillation amplitude $x_0$. The constant $\alpha(x_0)$ slowly varies
between $\sqrt{\log (2)}$ at $x_0 \ll \Delta$ and unity for \mbox{$x_0 \gg \Delta$.} 
An analytical solution (\ref{eq:orb_orth}) is compared with numerical solution in 
Figure~\ref{fig:orb_orth} demonstrating their good agreement. { It is also clear 
from (\ref{sol.S.ort}), that the growth rate proportional to square root of time is 
a solution for arbitrary expanding sheet.}

\subsection{Current sheet thickness and particle acceleration}
\label{sect.Est}

In previous section we have found self-consistent solution for internal 
structure of current sheet, however, in this section we will show, that 
such solution cannot be asymptotic one. Below we evaluate the current 
sheet thickness based on its global structure. We will explore MHD equations 
in order to find asymptotic behaviour of current sheet.

Starting from the Faraday's law
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{B}{\Delta}=8\pi n_{\rm in} e \dfrac{v_z}{c}
\end{equation}
and combining it with the definition of multiplicity $\lambda$, we can express 
thickness of the current sheet through $v_{z}(t)/c$ and $n_{\rm out}/n_{\rm in}$ 
parameters:
\begin{equation}
\Delta=R_{L}\dfrac{t}{t_0}\dfrac{\Gamma}{4\lambda}\dfrac{c}{v_{z}}\dfrac{n_{\rm out}}{n_{\rm in}}.
\label{DD}
\end{equation}
Here $n_{\rm out}$ and $n_{\rm in}$ refer to particle number density outside a
nd inside the current sheet respectfully.

It is clear that asymptotically $v_{z}/c$ growths up to a constant value. For 
$v_{z}(\infty)/c<1$ we get non-relativistic case, which correspond to particle
motion discussed above. It is possible to determine value of 
$\delta p_{z}\simeq eB\Delta/c$:
 \begin{equation}
 \delta p_z = m_{\rm e}c \Gamma^2 \dfrac{c}{v_{z}}\dfrac{n_{\rm out}}{n_{\rm in}}.
 \label{eq:pz_final}
 \end{equation}
 This expression could be used for $\kappa \ge 1$ to get $\delta p_z(t)$, or for 
 $\kappa < 1$ to get $\delta p_z(\infty)$. For the latter case, the values of 
 $v_z$, $n_{\rm in}$ and $n_{\rm out}$ should be taken at $t = t_0$. 
 
 From equation (\ref{eq:pz_final}) one can see that if the sheet is relativistic 
 ($v_z \sim c$) and $n_{\rm in}\sim n_{\rm out}$, the particle can reach a Lorentz 
 factor $\gamma_{\rm e} \sim \Gamma^2 = \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3}$. It is obvious that 
 such rapid acceleration breaks some of the assumption made in the beginning (e.g. 
 the Lorentz factor of the current sheet in the laboratory frame is only $\Gamma$).
 On the other hand, one may expect that in realistic sheet $n_{\rm in} \gg n_{\rm out}$, 
 so $\gamma_{\rm e} \ll \Gamma^2$. 
 
 { Further, as was shown earlier, the sheet with $\Delta \gg \mathcal{R}_{\rm L}$ 
 collapses. Under this condition the force balance perpendicular to the sheet plane 
 can be written as
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{B^2}{8\pi} = n_{\rm in} \mathcal{E}_{\rm k},
 \label{balance}
 \end{equation}
 where $\mathcal{E}_{\rm k}(t)$ is the  particle thermal kinetic energy inside the sheet. 
 Using now the definition (\ref{sigma}) for magnetization parameter $\sigma_{\rm M}$, 
 one can rewrite this relation in a simple form
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\rm k}}{m_{\rm e} c^2} = 
 \frac{\sigma_{\rm M}}{\Gamma} \, \frac{n_{\rm out}}{n_{\rm in}}.
 \label{bbalance}
 \end{equation}
As we see, non-relativistic approximation inside the sheet is valid for high enough 
number density 
 \begin{equation}
  \frac{n_{\rm in}}{n_{\rm out}} > \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3}.
 \label{nonrel}
 \end{equation}

As a result, comparing relations (\ref{DD}) and (\ref{bbalance}) one can conclude 
that linear increase of the sheet thickness $\Delta \propto t$ predicted by~\citet{coroniti_striped_wind_1990} and~\citet{michel_pulsar_wind_1994} and 
recently reproduced in numerical simulation~\citep{Q} can be realized for constant
particle energy $\mathcal{E}_{\rm k}$ and constant ratio $n_{\rm in}/n_{\rm out}$
only. The first condition $\mathcal{E}_{\rm k} \approx$ const is in agreement with 
time-independent acceleration energy along the sheet. On the other hand, the second
one $n_{\rm in}/n_{\rm out} \approx$ const can be realized only if the particle
inflow significantly increases the number of particles inside the sheet. Such as
inflow was also reproduced in numerical simulations (see e.g.~\citealt{2015MNRAS.448..606C}).
 
 Besides, if the plasma is hot, $\mathcal{E}_{\rm k} > m_{\rm e} c^2$, we obtain for 
 the Larmor radius
 \begin{equation}
 \langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \rangle = \frac{c\langle p_\perp\rangle }{eB} =
 \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\rm k}}{eB} =
 R_{L}\dfrac{t}{t_0}\dfrac{\Gamma}{4\lambda}\dfrac{n_{\rm out}}{n_{\rm in}}.
 \end{equation}
As one can see, $\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L}\rangle = \Delta\cdot v_z/c$. Thus, for 
the condition  $\Delta \sim \mathcal{R}_{\rm L}$ to be fulfilled, relativistically 
hot current sheet requires $v_z \sim c$. 
 }
 
 { On the other hand, if the number density outside the sheet is much 
 smaller than inside, the number of particles inside the sheet cannot increase. This 
 will lead, to $n_{\rm in}\propto t^{-3}$, but $n_{\rm out}$ 
 will be proportional to $t^{-2}$. So the ratio between $n_{\rm out}$ and $n_{\rm in}$ 
 should be of order unity.}
 In this case particle acceleration, can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
    \delta p_z\simeq m_{\rm e}c \Gamma^2,
\end{equation}
or, in laboratory frame,
\begin{equation}
    \delta p_{z}^{\rm lab} \simeq m_{\rm e}c \Gamma.
\end{equation}
 Which is the same order as mean thermal momentum of particles inside current sheet.
 
% In order to determine the average Larmor radius of particles, one can use pressure balance
 %\begin{equation}
 %\frac{B^2}{8\pi} = n_{\rm in} T,
 %\end{equation}
% where $T(t)$ is the temperature of the sheet. If the plasma is hot, $T > m_{\rm e} c^2$, we obtain
% \begin{equation}
% \langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \rangle = \frac{c\langle p_\perp\rangle }{eB} = \frac{T}{eB} = R_{L}\dfrac{t}{t_0}\dfrac{\Gamma}{4\lambda}\dfrac{n_{\rm out}}{n_{\rm in}}.
% \end{equation}
%As one can see, $\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L}\rangle = \Delta\cdot v_z/c$. On the other hand, 
%as was shown earlier, the sheet with $\Delta \gg \mathcal{R}_{\rm L}$ collapses. Thus, 
%relativistically hot current sheet requires $v_z \sim c$. 
 
%As for the case of cold sheet $T\ll m_{\rm e}c^2$,
%\begin{equation}
%\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L}\rangle = \frac{c\langle p_\perp\rangle }{eB} = \frac{\sqrt{2m_{\rm e}T}c}{eB} = R_{L}\dfrac{t}{t_0}\dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{2}\lambda}\dfrac{n_{\rm out}^{1/2}}{n_{\rm in}^{1/2}}.
%\end{equation}
%In this case $\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm L}\rangle = \Delta\cdot\sqrt{2} v_z/c \sqrt{n_{\rm in}/n_{\rm out}}\Gamma^{-1}$. The approximate equality $\mathcal{R}_{\rm L} \simeq \Delta$ translates to $v_z/c \simeq \Gamma \sqrt{n_{\rm out}/n_{\rm in}}$. It is clear that this case can only work if $n_{\rm in}/n_{\rm out} > \Gamma^2$. So it is necessary for the cold current sheet to have number density inside the sheet much greater than outside. One can also show that in this case if $v_z \ll c$, than $v_z \sim \sqrt{2m_{\rm e}T}$, i.e. mean velocity is close to thermal one.


\section{Conclusions and discussion}
\label{sect:conc}

{ This paper provides the formalism to describe essentially time-dependent 
evolution of the current sheet in the pulsar wind. As the first step in this direction, 
we carry out the calculations in the comoving reference frame and successfully determine 
intrinsic electromagnetic fields of the current sheet. In our opinion, this approach 
allows to describe more vividly the physical processes in a sheet.}

%{\color{green} In this paper we have tried to make the next step in understanding the
%internal structure of the current sheet in the pulsar wind. Carrying out calculations 
%in the comoving reference frame we succeeded in determining intrinsic electromagnetic
%fields of the current sheet which is shown to be essentially time-dependent. In our 
%opinion, this approach allows us to describe more vividly the physical processes in a 
%sheet.}

In the first part of this paper we investigate asymptotic structure of the wind from 
rotating oblique neutron star using force-free approximation. {  General asymptotic 
solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation for quasi-spherical pulsar wind up to the second 
order in small parameter \mbox{$\varepsilon = (\Omega r/c)^{-1}$} was  obtained. We have 
shown that the wind can have arbitrary latitude dependence of the energy flux. In particular, 
our solution describes the latitudinal structure of the radial magnetic field obtained 
numerically for oblique rotator. The form of current sheet in asymptotic does not depend on latitudinal structure of and matches the one in Bogovalov solution (\citealt{1999A&A...349.1017B}) } 
%Pointing vector with Bogovalov-like solution such that shape of current sheet does
%not depend on the latitudinal structure of the radial magnetic field.

{ As the force-free approximation does not allow us to discuss the inner structure 
of the current sheet, we use MHD approximation in which the velocity of the pulsar wind 
is assumed to be less than that of light. Indeed, as it is well known (see, 
e.g.,~\citealt{bes98}), outside the fast magnetosonic surface the velocity of 
quasi-spherical MHD flow becomes almost constant. Using this property (and carrying 
out calculations in the comoving reference frame) we estimate the efficiency of the 
particle acceleration inside the sheet.}

{ The main conclusion of our consideration is that the intrinsic time-dependence 
of a sheet in the comoving reference frame (especially the increase of the sheet thickness 
$\Delta$) inevitably results in the appearance of the electric field which is larger than
magnetic one inside the sheet. It is this electric field that controls the electric current
of a sheet.}

{ Finally, after investigating the motion of individual particles in the time-dependent 
current sheet, we { evaluate} the width of the sheet and its time evolution. In particular, 
we considered both relativistic and non-relativistic temperatures inside the sheet.} 

{ In particular, it was shown, that while the individual particle orbit grows as 
$t^{1/2}$, the sheet as whole should growth linearly with time. This contradiction 
can be solved by using methods of kinetic equation. Since the particle inflow inside 
a sheet due to its expansion is considerable, the evolution of current sheet is 
determined by incoming particles and not by the evolution of individual particles 
inside the sheet.}

%For orthogonal pulsar in the case of non-relativistic particle equation of motion inside 
%arbitrary expanding current sheet have been found and solved numerically (even analytically 
%for particles deep inside current sheet). The amplitude of oscillations of particles inside 
%the sheet grows proportional to $t^{1/2}$. However such growth rate of the sheet thickness 
%cannot globally satisfied Maxwell equations without constant growth of number of particle.

%Analysis of the global current sheet structure leads to two possible solutions: one is 
%non-relativistic which requires linear growth of the mean particle velocity along the sheet.
%Another solution is relativistic, and predicts linear growth of the current sheet thickness. 
%Such a solution predicts effective particle acceleration along the sheet. Linear expansion 
%can only continue until the thickness of the current sheet becomes comparable to the distance 
%between two sheets in stripped wind: $\Delta_{\rm lab} \sim \pi R_{\rm L}$. As one can see, 
%this happens at
%\begin{equation}
%r = 4\pi\lambda r_{\rm F} = 4\pi\lambda\sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3} R_{\rm L}.
%\end{equation}
%For Crab parameters ($\lambda\simeq 10^4$, $\sigma\simeq 10^6$)  $r\simeq 10^7R_{\rm L}$ which 
%is less then termination shock distance ($ 10^9 R_{\rm L}$).  

{ As for particle acceleration, we show that in relativistic case when number
density inside the sheet is similar to one outside the sheet, particle gains additional
$m_{\rm e}c\sigma^{1/3}$ momentum (in laboratory frame) due to expansion of a sheet. It is
important to notice that although the acceleration region $|{\boldsymbol E}| > |{\boldsymbol B}|$ is
narrow, the trajectories of particles are adjusted in such a way that they accelerate 
in MHD region $|{\boldsymbol E}| < |{\bf B}|$ every half period in one direction, cross 
$|{\bf E}| > |{\boldsymbol B}|$ zone, and then accelerate in the same direction again 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:trap}). }

Finally, it is important to highlight the difference between present article and~\citet{2001PASA...18..415K} in which authors use global equation in order to 
determine growth of current sheet thickness. In our work we do not consider 
reconnection, so our result should be interpreted as pre-reconnection sheet structure.
{ However, the electric field, which results from time-dependence of sheet 
thickness in case of linear growth, has the same structure as reconnection field  
and it is possible, that even in case of reconnection, our description of 
individual particle motion remains relevant.}

\section{Fields in a comoving frame for align case}
\label{Appendix.align}

In this Appendix we investigate the particle motion inside and outside of
the time-dependent current sheet with magnetic field
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:B1}\\
B_y & = B_0 \frac{R_{\rm L}}{ct} \tanh\left[\frac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right]. 
\label{eqn:B2}
\end{align}

For the aligned case we consider the same functional form of the time dependence of the sheet thickness on time 
$\Delta(t)=\Delta_0(t/t_0)^{\kappa}$. Then, the expression for the electric field
\begin{eqnarray}
E_x & = & \dfrac{B_0 R_{\rm L} z}{c^2t^2} \tanh\left[\frac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right], 
\label{eqnB:exO2d}
\\
\label{Appendix:ez.al}
E_z & = & 0,
\end{eqnarray}
again does not satisfy Maxwell equations for arbitrary $\kappa$, and remains valid only for $\kappa = 1$. This corresponds to the linear growth of the sheet thickness due to the radial expansion with constant opening angle of a sheet.
 
Similarly to the orthogonal case there are two possibilities to make the fields satisfy Maxwell equations:

 (i) Changing $x$-component of electric field, without any change of $z$-component

 (ii) Changing $z$-component without any change of $x$-component.

In contrast to the orthogonal case we change $x$-component of the
electric field instead of adding $E_{z}$ one. This implies that Hamiltonian for aligned case 
will be independent of $x$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{H}^{\rm al}
=c \left(m^2c^2+ P^{2}_{z} + p^{2}_{z}\right)^{1/2},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
P_{x} = p_{x} - \dfrac{eB_0R_L\Delta(t)}{c^2t}
\log\left[\cosh\left(\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

Finally, similarly to the orthogonal case, we can find the solution of Maxwell equations by choosing 
the integration constant such that electric field vanishes at infinity.
\begin{equation}
\label{Appendix:ex.al}
\begin{split}
E_{x} = \dfrac{B_0R_L\Delta(t)}{c^2t^2}
\left\{(1-\kappa)\log\left[2\cosh\left(\frac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right)\right]+\right.\\
\left.+\kappa\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}\tanh\left(\frac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right)\right\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
As a result, an estimation of the current sheet width based on the equality between 
Larmor radius and the sheet width is still valid for the aligned case. But here the drift leads  
to the rarefaction of sheet, since it is directed perpendicular to the sheet. On the other hand, since 
$\partial\mathcal{H}/\partial x =0$, we have $P_{x} =$ const. Hence, the particle can gain acceleration along the sheet only due to electromagnetic part of momentum
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\delta p_x=\dfrac{eB_0R_L}{c^2}\left\{\dfrac{\Delta_0}{t_0}
\log\left[\cosh\dfrac{z_0}{\Delta_0}\right]\right.
-\\-\left.
\dfrac{\Delta(t)}{t}
\log\left[\cosh\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right]\right\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 
\subsection{Particle motion}
\label{sect:al}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{align-eps-converted-to.pdf}
\caption{Numerical solution to equation (\ref{App.case1}). The self consistency obtained for $\kappa=0.35$. }
\label{fig:App.sol}
\end{figure}

For aligned current sheet we use expressions (\ref{eqn:B2}), (\ref{Appendix:ez.al}), and
(\ref{Appendix:ex.al}) for electric and magnetic fields:
\begin{align}
& B_y   = B_0 \frac{t_0}{t} \tanh\frac{z}{\Delta(t)},\\
\begin{split}
 E_x = B_0\dfrac{R_{\rm L}\Delta(t)}{(ct)^2} 
\left\{(1-\kappa)\log\left[2\cosh\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}\right]+\right.\\
\left.+\kappa\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}\tanh\frac{x}{\Delta(t)}\right\},
\end{split}
\\
&E_z = 0.
\end{align}
Here again $\Delta(t)\propto t^{\kappa}$. After writing down equations of motion and some 
algebra we obtain the following equation for $z$ coordinate of the particle:
\begin{equation}
\ddot{z}=\dot{x}\dfrac{\Lambda}{t}\tanh\dfrac{z}{\Delta(t)}
\end{equation} 
 and equality for for $x$-component of velocity
 \begin{equation}
 \dot{x}=v_0+\Lambda\dfrac{\Delta_0}{t_0}\ln[2\cosh(x_0/\Delta_0)]-\Lambda\dfrac{\Delta}{t}\ln[2\cosh(x/\Delta)],
 \end{equation}
which corresponds to conservation of $x$-component of generalize momentum. 
After that we should consider three cases:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item 
 $\kappa < 1$. In this case on large time-scales the first term dominates, 
so we can neglect the second one. The same takes place when $\kappa=1$ but $\dot{x}\sim {\rm const}\neq0$
\item
 $\kappa > 1$. In this case we neglect the first term.
\item
$\kappa = 1$, $\dot{x}\rightarrow 0$. This scenario is possible if $\Delta\propto t$. 
In this case $z(t)=z_0(t)+\delta z(t)$, where $z_0/\Delta =$ const.
Accordingly, $\delta z\ll z_0$ $z_0''(t)=0$.  
\end{enumerate}  
In the first case we have
  \begin{equation}
  \label{App.case1}
  \ddot{z}=\Lambda\dfrac{v_0+V}{t}\tanh(z/\Delta),
  \end{equation}
  where $V=\Lambda\dfrac{\Delta_0}{t_0}\ln[2\cosh(x/0/t_0)]$.
This equation cannot be solved analytically for arbitrary $\kappa$ even in $z/\Delta\ll 1$ limit. For $v+V_0<0$ the numerical solution of this equation has shown at (\ref{fig:App.sol}).
%However if almost all particle $v_0+V$ and, since $v_0=V_J+V_T$, where $V_{x}=\frac{1}{2}j_x/(en)$-current velocity which is mean velocity of one of the component and $V_T$ is thermal velocity. Since $j_x<0$, $V_J<0$ and we should required, that $V_J+V<V_T$ in order to make $v_0+V<0$ for almost all particles. The numerical simulations show, that in this condition particles will move inside sheet. When $v_0+V>0$ the particle motion apparently it can be described by equations, from case 3.

In second case we obtain following equation:
  \begin{equation}
\ddot{z} = -\Lambda^2\dfrac{\Delta}{t^2}\tanh(z/\Delta)\log[2\cosh(z/\Delta)].
\end{equation} 

This equation is the similar to (\ref{eq.x.full.ort}). As we already 
establish above, it describes particle orbit with $t^{1/2}$ radius growth rate.
%Thus, one can conclude that the only solution with particle orbit expanding at the same rate as the sheet thickness corresponds to $\kappa = 1$ when 
%$\dot{x}\rightarrow 0$. In this case we obtain 
%following equation for $\delta z$:

Finally for $\kappa = 1$ we have
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\delta z}=-\Lambda^2\dfrac{\delta z}{t^2}\tanh^2(x_0/\Delta).
\end{equation}
The solution of this equation is 
\begin{equation}
\delta z=\sqrt{t}\cos\left[\Lambda
\tanh\left(\dfrac{x_0}{\Delta(t)}\right)\log t\right].
\end{equation}
  This solution describes radial motion of particle experiencing Larmor's motion in declining field.
%As we see, for align current sheet the have the same scaling 
%$\delta z \propto \sqrt{t}$ as for orthogonal one.

%So there are two types of particles in align case: one of them has $v_0+\Lambda\dfrac{\Delta_0}{t_0}\ln[2\cosh(z_0/\Delta_0)]>0$ and the other has $v_0+\Lambda\dfrac{\Delta_0}{t_0}\ln[2\cosh(z_0/\Delta_0)]<0$

%It is obvious to consider the firs one particles inside current sheet and the others outside it. So for self-consistent solution we should require $V_J>\dfrac{eB_0\Delta_0}{m_ec}$ or that particles will gain less momentum, that they initially had:
%\begin{equation}
%\delta p_z<p_z

\subsection{Particle acceleration and the value of current sheet thickness}

In this Section, we estimate current sheet thickness and particle acceleration. We try to use as less number of assumptions as possible. Our assumptions include the following:

1. Maxwell equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{B}{\Delta} = \frac{8\pi}{c}n_0 e v_z;
\end{equation}

2. Definition of multiplicity outside the current sheet
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\rm M} = \frac{\Omega e B_{\rm LC} R_{\rm LC}^2}{4 \lambda m_e c^3};
\end{equation}

3. Concentration of particles inside the current sheet in laboratory frame:
\begin{equation}
    n_{\rm lab}^{\rm cs} (r) = \lambda_{\rm cs} n_{\rm GJ} (R_{\rm LC}) (r/R_{\rm LC})^{-2};
\end{equation}

4. Lorenz transforms of magnetic field and concentration into comoving reference frame
\begin{equation}
    n_0 = n_{\rm lab} \Gamma^{-1}, \qquad B = B_{\rm LC} (t_0/t) \Gamma^{-2};
\end{equation}

5. Approximate amplitude of particle acceleration along the current sheet:
\begin{equation}
p_z \sim e B \Delta/c.
\end{equation}

If one sets $r = r_{\rm F} = \sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3} R_{\rm LC}$, and $t = t_0$, then the unknown parameters of the system are $\Delta_0$, $v_z$, $B_0$, $B_{\rm LC}$, $n_0$, $n_{\rm lab}$. The known parameters are $\lambda$, $\lambda_{\rm cs}$, $\sigma_{\rm M} = \Gamma^3$, $R_{\rm LC}$. Having 6 equations for 6 unknowns, the system can be solved. 

As a result, current sheet thickness equals
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:delta0}
\Delta = R_{\rm LC} \frac{t}{t_0} \frac{\Gamma}{4 \lambda_{\rm cs}} \frac{c}{v_z},
\end{equation}
while the acceleration estimate yields 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pz}
p_z v_z \sim m_e c^2 \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3} \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm cs}}.
\end{equation}
The total number of particles in the current sheet
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ntot}
    N_{\rm tot} (t) \propto n(t) \Delta(t) t^2 \propto \Delta(t)\lambda_{\rm cs}(t) \propto t/v_z(t).
\end{equation}

The analysis above lacks the value of $\lambda_{\rm cs}$ which is treated as a free parameter. However, we can make some conclusions based on the limiting case.

\subsubsection{Case 1: low multiplicity, ultra-relativistic sheet}

If we assume that the multiplicity of the current sheet is low, of the order of the multiplicity outside the sheet $\lambda_{\rm cs} \sim \lambda$, then $p_z v_z \sim m_e c^2 \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3} \gg m_e c^2$ and $v_z \sim c$. Then, from equations (\ref{eq:delta0}) and (\ref{eq:ntot}), one gets
\begin{equation}
    N_{\rm tot} \propto t, \qquad \Delta_0 \propto t/\lambda_{\rm cs}(t).
\end{equation}
As $N_{\rm tot}$ does not depend on the $\lambda_{\rm cs}$, it does not constrain the multiplicity of the current sheet. However, if we assume that the total number of particles in the sheet can only be changed by trapping the particles in the expanding current sheet, $N_{\rm tot} \propto \Delta_0$, then $\Delta_0 \propto t$ and $\lambda_{\rm cs} = \rm const$. This is the case when current sheet multiplicity equals to the multiplicity outside and particles just get trapped in the sheet. The parameters of such sheet are:
\begin{eqnarray}
B &\propto& t^{-1};\\
n &\propto& t^{-2};\\
\Delta_0 &\propto& t;\\
v_z &\sim& c \propto {\rm const};\\
p_z &\sim& m c \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3} \propto {\rm const};\\
\lambda_{\rm cs} &=& \lambda = {\rm const};\\
N_{\rm tot} &\propto& t.
\end{eqnarray}

One needs to note, that in such ultra-relativistic current sheet Lorenz factor of particles $\gamma \sim \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3} \gg \Gamma =\sigma_{\rm M}^{1/3}\gg 1$. Such motion breaks the assumptions we made when deriving the fields in comoving reference frame.

The typical Larmor radius of particles in this case
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm L} \propto p_z/B \propto t \propto \Delta_0.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Case 2: high multiplicity, non-relativistic sheet}

The situation is quite different in high multiplicity case $p_z v_z \ll m_e c^2$. This requires $\lambda_{\rm cs}\gg\lambda \sigma_{\rm M}^{2/3}$. For such case one gets
\begin{equation}
v_z \propto \lambda_{\rm cs}^{-1/2},
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
N_{\rm tot}\propto  t \lambda_{\rm cs}^{1/2}, \qquad \Delta_0 \propto t \lambda_{\rm cs}^{-1/2}.
\end{equation}
One can see that the case $N_{\rm tot} \propto \Delta_0$ is realised if $\lambda_{\rm cs} = \rm const$. However, if the multiplicity if the current sheet is so large, trapping a small number of outside particles does not influence the total number of particles. So, the case $N_{\rm tot} \propto \Delta_0$ does not really make sense. Instead, $N_{\rm tot} \propto \rm const$ is more reasonable. For such case $\Delta_0 \propto t^2$. The parameters of such current sheet
\begin{eqnarray}
B &\propto& t^{-1};\\
n &\propto& t^{-4};\\
\Delta_0 &\propto& t^2;\\
v_z & \propto& t;\\
p_z &\propto& t;\\
\lambda_{\rm cs} &\propto& t^{-2};\\
N_{\rm tot} &\propto& \rm const.
\end{eqnarray}

Such solution does not violate the assumptions made when deriving the fields in the comoving frame. However, such solution can only be realised during the linear stage of particle acceleration.

The typical Larmor radius of particles in this case
\begin{equation}
r_{\rm L} \propto p_z/B \propto t^2 \propto \Delta_0.
\end{equation}

******************************************

On the other hand, we can stick with the Michel fields without
coefficients (orthogonal case):
\begin{eqnarray}
B_y &=& B_0 \frac{t_0}{t} h(x,t),\\
E_x &=& B_0 \frac{z}{ct} \frac{t_0}{t} h(x,t).
\end{eqnarray}
As was shown in Sect.~\ref{sect:width}, the $z$-component of the
electric field arises and is equal to
\begin{equation}
E_{z} 
= B_{0}\frac{t_0}{c t} \int\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} {\rm d}x.
\end{equation}

In realistic case 
\begin{equation}
h(x,t) = \tanh\left(\frac{x}{L_0 (t/t_0)^d} \right),
\end{equation}
the condition $E_z(\infty) = 0$ fixes the electric field in the center
of the sheet:
\begin{equation}
E_z(0) = B_0 d \frac{L_0}{c t_0} \left(\frac{t}{t_0} \right)^{d-2}\log 2.
\end{equation}
As a result, for $\kappa < 1$ the total energy gain 
$\Delta {\cal E} = \int {\bf E  v}{\rm d}t$ can be evaluated as
\begin{equation}
\Delta {\cal E} \sim e B_0 L_0.
\end{equation}

In aligned case the solution has different form:
\begin{equation}
E_z = B_0\frac{t_0}{t} \left(\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
+ \frac{z}{ct}\frac{\partial h}{\partial z}\right)x.
\end{equation}

For
\begin{equation}
h(z,t) = \tanh\left(\frac{z}{L_0 (t/t_0)^d} \right),
\end{equation}
the solution is zero at $z=0$ and $z=\infty$, and has a maximum value
of:
\begin{equation}
E_{z}^{\rm max} = 0.48 B_0 (1-d) \frac{x}{c t} \left(\frac{t_0}{t}
\right)\cdot C,
\end{equation}
where numerical coefficient $0.48$ is, approximately,
maximum of a function $z \cosh(z)^{-2}$. For $x\sim L_0$ it has the
same order of magnitude, as a field in orthogonal case.

\section{Two-fluid MHD effects}
\label{2F}

Let us consider axisymmetric outflow of a two-component plasma. The structure 
of the flow is described by Maxwell equations and equation of motion
\begin{equation}
\label{Appendix: Maxwell+Motion common}
\begin{split}
&\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=4\pi\rho,\hspace{10pt}\nabla\times\bm{E}=0,\\
\hspace{3pt}
&\nabla\cdot\bm{B}=0,
\nabla\times\bm{B}=\displaystyle\frac{4\pi}{c}\bm{J},\\
&(\bm{v}^{\pm},\nabla)\bm{p}^{\pm} 
= \pm e\left[\bm{E} + \frac{\bm{v}^{\pm}}{c} \times \bm{B}\right].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here we consider the fields far from the current sheet, so we put down $\Theta(...)$ factor 
in further calculations.

Asymptotic behaviour of fields in the force-free approximation ($\gamma=\infty$) can be obtained 
from general formula (\ref{dPsi}) by taking only first term: $\Psi(r,\theta)=\Psi_0(\theta)$. 
After that one could obtain following expressions for electromagnetic field:
\begin{align}
&B_r^0=B_s\left(\displaystyle\frac{R_s}{r}\right)^2\displaystyle\frac{F(\theta)}{\sin\theta}
,\\
&B_{\theta}^0=0
,\\
&B_{\varphi}^0=-B_s\dfrac{\Omega R_s}{c}\displaystyle\frac{R_s}{r} F(\theta)
,\\
&\rho_{\rm e}^0=\displaystyle\frac{\nabla\cdot\bm{E}}{4\pi}=-\displaystyle\frac{B_s}{4\pi r}
\dfrac{\Omega R_s}{c}\displaystyle\frac{R_s}{r} D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)
,\\
&J_r^0=\displaystyle\frac{c}{4\pi}(\nabla\times\bm{B})_r
=\displaystyle\frac{cB_s}{4\pi r}\dfrac{\Omega R_s}{c}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta),
\\
&J_{\theta}^0=0,
\\
&J^0_{\varphi}=\displaystyle\frac{cB_s}{4\pi r}\left(\displaystyle\frac{R_s}{r}\right)^2D_{\theta}^-F(\theta),
\end{align}
where $D_{\theta}^{\pm}F(\theta)=F'(\theta)\pm F(\theta)\cot\theta$. The choise $F(\theta)=\sin\theta$ 
corresponds to Michel solution.

It is convenient to introduce the electric field potential $\Phi(r,\theta)$, so that 
$\bm{E}=-\nabla \Phi$ and
\begin{equation}
\Phi^{0} = -\dfrac{\Omega R_s^2B_s}{c}\Psi_0(\theta).
\end{equation}
Finally, the number densities can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
&n^{+} = \dfrac{B_s}{4\pi R_s e}\dfrac{R_s\Omega}{c}
\left(\dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)^2\left[\lambda-\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)\right],
\\
&n^{-} = \dfrac{B_s}{4\pi R_s e}\dfrac{R_s\Omega}{c}
\left(\dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)^2\left[\lambda+\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)\right],
\end{eqnarray}
where again $\lambda \sim 10^{3}$--$10^{5}$ is the multiplication parameter. 
%In what follows we consider $\lambda={\rm const}$. 
In general case we  have the $\varphi$-component of current, so we cannot neglect 
toroidal particle motion. Thus, in force-free limit the particle velocity can be 
written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{v_{r}^{0}}{c} = 
1-\dfrac{1}{2}\left(\dfrac{c}{\Omega r}\right)^2
\left[\dfrac{D^-_{\theta}F(\theta)}{\lambda}\right]^2.
\end{equation}
%Or we may put $v_r^0=c$ since our solution correct only up to $r^{-2}$ terms.
%
%\begin{align}
%&v_{\theta}^0=0
%,\\
%&v_{\phi}^0=c\dfrac{c}{\Omega r}\dfrac{D_{\theta}^-F(\theta)}{\lambda}.
%\end{align}

For further convenience we will denote $\lambda^{-1} \, D_{\theta}^-F(\theta)$ as $b(\theta)$.
Then one can seek the first-order correction in the following form
\begin{align}
\label{Appendix: Corrections.first}
&n^{\pm}=\dfrac{B_s}{4\pi R_s e}\dfrac{R_s\Omega}{c}
\left(\dfrac{R_s}{r}\right)^2
\left[\lambda\mp\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)+\eta^{\pm}(r,\theta)\right],
\\
&\Phi(r,\theta)=\dfrac{\Omega R_s^2B_s}{c}[\Psi_0(\theta)+ q(r,\theta)],
\\
&\Psi(r,\theta)=\dfrac{\Omega R_s^2B_s}{c}[\Psi_0(\theta)+\varepsilon f(r,\theta)],
\\
&v_{r}^{\pm}=c\left[1+\xi^{\pm}_{r}(r,\theta)\right],
\\
&v_{\theta}^{\pm}=c\xi^{\pm}_{\theta}(r,\theta),
\\
&v_{\varphi}^{\pm}=c\left[b(\theta)\dfrac{c}{r\Omega}+\xi^{\pm}_{\varphi}(r,\theta)\right],
\\
&B_{r}=B_s\dfrac{R_s^2}{\sin\theta r^2}
\left[F(\theta)+\varepsilon\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}\right],
\\
&B_{\theta}=-\varepsilon\dfrac{B_sR_s^2}{r\sin\theta}\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial \theta},
\\
&B_{\varphi}=-B_s\dfrac{\Omega R_s}{c}\dfrac{R_s}{r}\left[F(\theta)+\zeta(r,\theta)\right],
\\
&E_{r}=-\dfrac{\Omega B_s R_s^2}{c}\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial r},
\\
\label{Appendix: Correction.last}
&E_{\theta}=-\dfrac{\Omega R_s^2B_s}{cr}\left[F(\theta)+\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial \theta}\right].
\end{align}

 Substituting now expansions (\ref{Appendix: Corrections.first})--(\ref{Appendix: Correction.last}) 
into (\ref{Appendix: Maxwell+Motion common}) we obtain the following system of equations
\begin{align}
\label{Appendix: Faradey law.phi}
&D_{\theta}^{+}\zeta=-2\delta\eta
+2\left[\lambda\delta\xi_r-\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)(\xi^+_r+\xi_r^-)\right], \\
\label{Appendix: Gauss law}
&2\delta\eta + \dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial r}\right)
+D^+_{\theta}\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial\theta}=0,\\
\label{Appendix: Faradey law.theta}
&\dfrac{\partial \zeta}{\partial r} = \dfrac{2}{r}\left[\lambda\delta\xi_{\theta}-\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)(\xi^+_{\theta}+\xi_{\theta}^-)\right],\\
\label{Appendix: Faradey law.r}
&\dfrac{\varepsilon}{\sin\theta}\left(\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial r^2}+\dfrac{1}{r^2}D_{\theta}^-\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}\right)=\nonumber\\
&=-2\dfrac{\Omega}{rc}\left[\lambda\delta\xi_{\varphi}-\dfrac{1}{2}D_{\theta}^+F(\theta)(\xi^+_{\varphi}+\xi_{\varphi}^-)\right],\\
\label{Appendix: Motion.theta}
&\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\xi^{\pm}_{\theta}\gamma^{\pm}\right)+\dfrac{\xi_{\theta}^{\pm}\gamma^{\pm}}{r}=\nonumber\\
&=\pm 4\lambda\sigma_{\rm M}\left[-\dfrac{1}{r}\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial\theta}+\dfrac{\zeta}{r}-\dfrac{F(\theta)}{r}\xi^{\pm}_r+\dfrac{c}{\Omega r^2}\dfrac{F(\theta)}{\sin\theta}\xi^{\pm}_{\varphi}\right],\\
\label{Appendix: Motion.r}
&\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}(\gamma^{\pm})=\mp 4\lambda\sigma_{\rm M}\left[\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial r}+\dfrac{F(\theta)}{r}\xi^{\pm}_{\theta}\right],\\
\label{Appendix: Motion.phi}
&\dfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\xi^{\pm}_{\varphi}\gamma^{\pm}\right)+\dfrac{\xi_{\varphi}^{\pm}\gamma^{\pm}}{r}=
\mp 4\lambda\sigma_{\rm M}\left[\varepsilon\dfrac{c}{\Omega r\sin\theta}\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial r}+\dfrac{c}{\Omega r^2}\dfrac{F(\theta)}{\sin\theta}\xi^{\pm}_{\theta}\right],
\end{align}
where $\delta A=A^{+}-A^{-}$. In these equations all the deflecting function 
are supposed to be $\ll 1$, and we have neglected the terms $R_{\rm L}^{2}/r^{2}$ 
times less than the leading ones. We also have neglected $b(\theta)$ in the left-hand 
side of equations (\ref{Appendix: Motion.theta})--(\ref{Appendix: Motion.phi}) 
since $b\simeq \lambda^{-1} \ll1$.
 
General system of equations (\ref{Appendix: Gauss law})--(\ref{Appendix: Motion.phi}) has several 
integrals. First, Eqns. (\ref{Appendix: Faradey law.theta}) and (\ref{Appendix: Motion.r}) lead to 
\begin{equation}
\label{Appendix: Energy Cons.}
\zeta-\dfrac{2D^+_{\theta} F(\theta)}{F(\theta)} q 
+\dfrac{2 \lambda(\gamma^{+}+\gamma^{-})
-D^{+}_{\theta}F(\theta)\Delta\gamma}{4\sigma_{\rm M}\lambda F(\theta)}=M(\theta),
\end{equation}
 which is simply the energy conservation law. On the other hand, Eqns. 
(\ref{Appendix: Motion.r}) and (\ref{Appendix: Motion.phi}) result in 
\begin{equation}
q - \varepsilon f\pm\dfrac{1}{4\lambda\sigma_{\rm M}}\gamma^{\pm}
\left(1-\dfrac{\Omega r\sin\theta}{c}\xi^{\pm}_{\varphi} \right)=C^{\pm}(\theta),
\end{equation}
which can be consider as a conservation of $z$-component of the angular momentum.
Besides, as $\sigma_{\rm M}\lambda\gg 1$, one can neglect in Eqns. 
(\ref{Appendix: Motion.theta})--(\ref{Appendix: Motion.phi}) their left-hand sides. 
In this approximation  we have $\xi^+=\xi^-=\xi$ and $\gamma^+=\gamma^-=\gamma$, 
so that  
\begin{equation}
\label{Appendix:zeta.approx}
\zeta = \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial\theta}
+F(\theta)\xi_r-\dfrac{c}{\Omega r}\dfrac{F(\theta)}{\sin\theta}\xi_{\varphi},
\end{equation}  
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial q}{\partial r}+\dfrac{F(\theta)}{r}\xi_{\theta}=0
\end{equation}
 and
 \begin{equation}
\varepsilon f = q. 
\end{equation}
The last expression implies that within this approximation magnetic field lines
remain equi-potential. Finally, one can find that
\begin{equation}
\xi_{\varphi}<\dfrac{A}{r\sin\theta}.
\end{equation}
Hence, we can neglect the last term in Eqn. (\ref{Appendix:zeta.approx}) since it 
becomes proportional to $r^{-2}$ compared to the others terms. Thus, we have
\begin{equation}
\zeta = \dfrac{\partial q}{\partial\theta}+F(\theta)\xi_r,
\end{equation}
which can be rewritten as $B_{\varphi}-E_{\theta}=(1-\beta)B_{\varphi}$, or as
$E_{\theta}=\beta B_{\varphi}$.

\section{Numerical simulation}
\label{Appendix.sect.NS}

It is interesting to see, how do particles move in such a configuration of a time-dependent
current sheet. For this, we produce simple numerical simulations where we set external
electromagnetic field and look at the particle motion without investigating the influence 
of the particles on the field.

It is naturally to express momentum in $m_{\rm e} c$, coordinates in units of $\Delta_0$ and time in 
units of $t_0$. Then, it is convenient to express energy in $m_{\rm e} c^2$ and velocity in units of
$\Delta_0/t_0$. It allows us to move the the following dimensionless variables
\begin{align}
\tau &\equiv t/t_0,\\
\xi &\equiv x/\Delta_0,\\
\zeta &\equiv z/\Delta_0,\\
\pi_x &\equiv P_x/(m_{\rm e} c)\\
\pi_z &\equiv P_z/(m_{\rm e} c)\\
h\ &\equiv \mathcal{H}/(m_{\rm e} c^2)
\end{align}
In particular, we can rewrite dimensionless Hamiltonians as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h_{\rm ort}=\sqrt{1+(\pi_z-Q\tau^{d-1}\log[2\cosh(\xi\tau^{-d})])+\pi_x^2}-
\\ - Q\dfrac{\zeta\tau^{d-2}}{\lambda\gamma}\log[2\cosh(\xi\tau^{-d})].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
h_{\rm al}=\sqrt{1+(\pi_x + Q\tau^{d-1}\log[2\cosh(\zeta\tau^{-d})])+\pi_z^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here $Q$ is the charge of the particles ($-1$ for electrons and $1$ for positrons).

As to dimensionless equation of motion, they look like
\begin{align}
\pi'_x=-\lambda\gamma\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial\xi}& 
& \pi_z'=-\lambda\gamma\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial\zeta}\\
\xi'=\lambda\gamma\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial\pi_x}& 
&\zeta'=-\lambda\gamma\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial\pi_z}\\
\end{align}
But actually we have the system of four differential equations for orthogonal case only
as for aligned case $\pi_x =$ const. Both of systems have only one numerical parameter 
$\lambda \gamma\simeq 10^6-10^8$, which is rpm for characteristic time.

\section{Comparison with numerical simulation}
\label{sect:Num}

%To check the theoretical predictions 
In this section we present results of numerical simulations of particle motion inside self-consistent current sheet. Moreover we show that parameter $N$ (which is simply ratio of average Larmor radius of particles for $t=t_0$ to $\Delta_0$-initial sheet thickness), which wasn't determine for both cases should be equal to 1.

Appropriate equations of motion was formulated previously~\ref{sect:solAn}.
 We start with orthogonal case.
 
First of all, Fig.~\ref{fig:momentum} shows dependence 
of the momentum gain via additional electric field for orthogonal pulsar for 
presented which was estimated in Sect.~\ref{sect.Est} on initial  $x$ coordinate. Since the period of motion along $x$ axis is much smaller characteristic time scale, we consider all particles moving along $z$ axes. As one can see, the result for arbitrary initial position of particle is slightly differs from result from one for particle moving along $z$ axis.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{dP(x).jpeg}
\caption{Particle momentum gained by additional electric field against initial particle coordinate. }
\label{fig:momentum}
\end{figure}

Next we will numerically investigate two cases of initial condition from (\ref{sect.Est}) For $N=1$ and $N=10$ (\ref{fig:sheetort}), (\ref{fig:sheetort1}).

From Fig.\ref{fig:sheetort} one can see that there is a breaking point where amplitude of particle oscillation change it growth rate. In order to explain it we should take a closer look at definition of integral of motion (\ref{Iinv}):
\begin{equation}
    I=m_ez-\dot{z}t+\Delta(t)\dfrac{eB_0R_{\rm L}}{c^2m}\log\left[2\cosh\left(\dfrac{x}{\Delta}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
For particle which starts it's trajectory from $(0,0)$ :
\begin{equation}
    I=-m_ev_{z}(t_0)+\Delta(t)\dfrac{eB_0R_{\rm L}}{c^2m}\log2
\end{equation}
When $N\gg1$ it is defines by first term:
\begin{equation}
I\simeq \dfrac{m_eR_{L}}{\lambda^*}
\end{equation}
Thus the condition required to neglect this constant compared to $\Delta(t)\frac{eB_0R_{\rm L}}{c^2m}\log\left[2\cosh\left(\frac{x}{\Delta}\right)\right]$  is following:
\begin{equation}
(t/t_0)^{\kappa}>N^2
\end{equation}
Which is well-agreed with position of breaking point on (\ref{fig:sheetort}). 

Fig.\ref{fig:sheetort1}  shows that in case of $N=1$ particle trajectory will expand by power law from beginning.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{Ort.jpeg}
\caption{$x$-coordinate of the particle motion (oscillating blue line) and the thickness of the sheet  
 with $\kappa = 0.5$ $N=10$

\label{fig:sheetort}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{OrtlessN.jpeg}
\caption{$x$-coordinate of the particle motion (oscillating blue line) and the thickness of the sheet  
 with $\kappa = 0.5$ $N=1$ for orthogonal case. In this case power growth of sheet thickness is valid at every timescale }
\label{fig:sheetort1}
\end{figure}

Investigation of kinetic effects is beyond scope of this article. However we can introduce "typical particle" in following sense:

From analytical consideration (\ref{sect:solAn}) it is clear, that motion along axis $z$ doesn't effect motion along $x$ axis. So we can introduce two different parameters $V_z$ which is mean particle velocity and $V_T$ which is thermal velocity. From (\ref{sect.Est}) one can obtain, that $V_z/(eB_0R_{\pm L}\Delta_0c^2t_0m_e)=4N^2$ and $V_T/(eB_0R_{\pm L}\Delta_0c^2t_0m_e)=2N$ So our typical particle will start with $\dot{z}=V_Z(N)$, $\dot{x}=V_T(N)$ and we put $x=z-=0$. It is possible now to investigate dependence of amplitude of such particle on $N$ and determine N for which $Amp(t)/\Delta=1$. As we can see from Fig.\ref{fig:amport} $N\simeq 1$ 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{Amp(N)ort.jpeg}
\caption{Amplitude of particle oscillations to sheet thickness for different $N$,  for orthogonal case. Particles starts with following initial conditions $x=z=0$  $\dot{z}=V_Z(N)$, $\dot{x}=V_T(N)$}
\label{fig:amport}
\end{figure}

Now we move to align case. 

It is clear, that "typical particle" method, which we introduced for orthogonal case works in align case as well. 

As it was stressed out in section (\ref{sect:al}) analytical consideration doesn't exclude values of $N<1$ (ratio between particle gyroradius and sheet thickness). However for such values it became impossible to construct self-consistent solution for both positrons and electrons. Fig.\ref{fig:sheetalp} and Fig.\ref{fig:sheetale} show trajectories for typical positron and electron with the same thermal velocity and opposite current velocity. Positron is moving along border of sheet in a way we expected for self-consistent solution. However electron starts to oscillate in side the sheet which is not self consistent. For $N>1$ this problem doesn't occur and  self-consistent solution can be obtained.

Determination of $N$ in align case are similar to one in orthogonal case finding dependence of mean $z(t)/t$ on $N$ and compare it to thickness of sheet determines the value of $N$ Fig.\ref{fig:ampal}

As result of numerical simulations we establish that in both orthogonal and align cases $N\simeq1$ or initial particle gyroradius is the same order as sheet's width.he same order as sheet's width.
