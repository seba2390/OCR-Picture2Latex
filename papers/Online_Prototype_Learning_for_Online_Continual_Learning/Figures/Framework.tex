  \caption{Illustration of the proposed \frameworkName framework. 
  At time step (iteration) $i$, the incoming data $X$ and replay data $X^\mathrm{b}$ are augmented and fed to the model to learn features with \methodname.
  Then, the proposed \dataaugname senses easily misclassified classes from all seen classes and enhances their decision boundaries.
  Concretely, \dataaugname adaptively selects more data for mixup according to the probability distribution $P$.
