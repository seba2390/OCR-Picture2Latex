\section{\large Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclution}

With this work, we presented a spherical projection model, a deflection metric, which can be used to encode geometric sensor properties to a projected image, and an architecture for joint processing of projected images and the deflection metric. The deflection metric is simple and thus efficient without incurring any additional computational requirements. In our experiment, we evaluated the usability of our method for the considered use case.

Since our method is suitable for processing LiDAR data and other sensors such as cameras, we would also like to consider other sensors and further use cases, as well as real-world data, to identify and relax the limitations of our approach.
