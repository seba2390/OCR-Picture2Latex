\section{Annotation Interface}

This is a brief introduction to our browser-based annotation platform, 
which we have built to better support our long-term data annotation and guarantee annotation quality. % (tested with Chrome and Sougou).
The web page is \url{http://url}.
%\url{http://hlt-service.suda.edu.cn/syn-dep-batch}. Please try.

The annotation interface is shown in Figure \ref{fig:anno-sys-interface-begin}. 
% 在每个词的最前面，我们给出该词所有可能的词性供标注者参考。同时，我们在标注任务的下方，针对不同词性，给出了相应例句。
At the front of each character, we give all the possible part-of-speech (POS) tags for the annotator to refer to. At the same time, we give the corresponding example sentences for different POS tags in the bottom of the labeling task. Meanwhile, to highlight selected characters to be annotated, the system marks the corresponding characters with red circles.

\caption{
After annotation: the characters are annotated with their heads and red circles disappear.
}
\label{fig:anno-sys-interface-finish}
\end{figure}

To annotate a dependency, annotators just need to first click the head character, and then click the modifier character, and finally select the relation label, as show in Figure \ref{fig:anno-sys-interface-select-label}.

Annotators can only annotate head characters for the selected characters, and must complete all selected tasks before submission. Once the head character is decided, the corresponding red circle disappear, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:anno-sys-interface-finish}.
Annotator may also cancel a dependency by right-click on the modifier character.

We provide a strict annotation guideline, and require annotators to study and follow it. 

The annotated results, before submission, should be a legal tree: 1) single-headed, 2) acyclic, 3) single-root. 


\section{Workflow Control}


We design a sophisticated workflow so that the data quality can be guaranteed through the platform and avoid further offline process of the annotated data.


First, the system dynamically assigns each task to two random annotators. 
If the two submissions are not the same (inconsistent dependency or relation label), a third expert annotator will compare them and decide a single answer. %Our annotation platform also provides 
%As a kind of feedback, % function. For example, 
%As a strategy of improvement
As a kind of feedback, the platform will return the answer to the annotator who makes mistakes and 
the annotator must correct his/her wrong submission accordingly for the sake of improvement. %  to the corresponding correct answers. 
If an annotator insists that the answer is wrong, he/she may click a complaint button %if the expert annotator is wrong, 
and the platform then distributes the task to a final senior expert. 
We find this procedure is extremely effective for quality control.
