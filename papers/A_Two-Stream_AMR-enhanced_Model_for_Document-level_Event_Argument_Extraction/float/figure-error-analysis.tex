    \textbf{Error analysis on RAMS dataset}. 
    The triggers are in \textbf{bold} with corresponding event types in green.
    The \underline{underlined} spans refer to golden arguments, with their roles in blue.
    The [bracketed] spans denote the predicted arguments, with their roles noted in red.
    We illustrate the number of different kinds of errors for Two-step and our \modelname, which has $275$ and $233$ errors in total, respectively.
    Compared with Two-step, \modelname decreases errors in most error categories, especially for \emph{Wrong Role} and \emph{Over-extract}.
