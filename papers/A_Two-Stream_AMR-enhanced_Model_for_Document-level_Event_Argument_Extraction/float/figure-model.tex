    \textbf{Overview of our \modelname}.
    Firstly, taking an entire document as input, \modelname first encodes the document by the two-stream encoding module, where the global and local encoders with different attention reception fields are used to capture the context in different scopes.
    Then the AMR-guided interaction module constructs global AMR graphs and local ones to stimulate the interactions among concepts in the document, especially those far away from each other, based on graph neural network.
    Next, the information fusion module fuses the two-stream representations, and also strengthens the boundary information through a boundary loss.
    Finally, the classification module makes predictions for candidate spans.
    For conciseness, we assume the document has three sentences, $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, and the event is triggered by $y_2$ with $[z_2, z_3]$ being a candidate argument span.
