Following~\citet{rams}, we formulate doc-level event argument extraction as follows.
We define that a document $\mathcal{D}$ consists of $N$ sentences, and a sentence is comprised of a sequence of words, i.e., $\mathcal{D}=\left \{ w_1, w_2, \dots, w_{\left | \mathcal{D} \right | } \right \}$, and $\mathrm{SEN}\left ( w_i \right ) \in \left [1, N\right ]$ refers to the sentence that $w_i$ belongs to.
We also define the event types set $\mathcal{E}$ and the corresponding argument roles set $\mathcal{R}_e$ for each event type $e\in\mathcal{E}$.
Then, given a document $\mathcal{D}$ and the trigger $t\in \mathcal{D}$ triggering the event type $e\in\mathcal{E}$, the task aims to detect all $(r,s)$ pairs for the event, where $r \in \mathcal{R}_e$ is an argument role for the event type $e$, and $s \subseteq  \mathcal{D}$ is a contiguous text span in the document.
