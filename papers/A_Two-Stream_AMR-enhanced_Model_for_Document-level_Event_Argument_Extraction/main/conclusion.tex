It is challenging to extract event arguments from a whole document, owing to the long-distance dependency between trigger and arguments over sentences and the distracting context.
To tackle these problems, we propose \textbf{T}wo-\textbf{S}tream \textbf{A}M\textbf{R}-enhanced extraction model (\textbf{\modelname}).
\modelname uses two-stream encoders to encode the document from different perspectives, followed by an AMR-guided interaction module to facilitate the document-level semantic interactions.
An auxiliary boundary loss is introduced to enhance the boundary information for spans.
Experiments on RAMS and WikiEvents datasets demonstrate that \modelname outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with $2.51$ and $5.13$ F1 improvements respectively, especially for cross-sentence argument extraction.
