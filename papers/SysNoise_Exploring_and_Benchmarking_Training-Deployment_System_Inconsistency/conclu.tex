\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces SysNoise, a harmful noise that frequently happens when the source training system switches to a disparate target system in deployments. We first identify and classify SysNoise based on the inference stage, and thereafter build a holistic benchmark and framework to quantitatively measure the impact of SysNoise on image classification, object detection, segmentation, and natural language processing tasks. Our large-scale experiments revealed that SysNoise is highly-influential and will cause model performance degeneration; additionally, common mitigations like data augmentation and adversarial training show limited effects on SysNoise.  

In the future, we will evaluate SysNoise on the real-world systems, and will continuously develop the benchmark to include more tasks. Our findings open a new research topic and we hope it will raise research attention to the performance and robustness of deep learning deployment systems.
