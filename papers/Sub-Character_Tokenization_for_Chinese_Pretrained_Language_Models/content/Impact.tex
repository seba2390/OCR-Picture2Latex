We expect our work to have a positive impact on the society. Firstly, we addressed the practical problem of handling input with real-world noises. Such noisy settings are very common in real-life applications. Our method, along with the evaluation framework, can help make language technologies more robust and reliable in real-world applications, especially for Chinese users. Secondly, we addressed the efficiency concern of large language models by significantly reducing both and training and inference time. This not only reduces the latency of these models in real-world applications, more importantly, helps reduce the environmental costs of using these large language models, moving further towards Green AI. All of our code and models are released with proper documentation in order to better facilitate the adoption of our work in a wide range of research and industrial applications.
