\section{Problem Description}\label{sec:problem}

Consider a multi-DoF robotic arm within a static and known workspace, of which the end-effector has state $\boldsymbol{r}$ such as its 6-D pose and gripper state.
Also, there are multiple objects of interest denoted by $\mathsf{O}=\{\mathsf{o}_1,\cdots,\mathsf{o}_J\}$. 
Each object is described by its state~$\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathsf{o}}$ such as its 6-D pose.

Moreover, there is a set of \emph{primitive} skills that enable the robot to manipulate these objects, denoted by $\mathsf{A}=\{\mathsf{a}_1,\mathsf{a}_2,\cdots,\mathsf{a}_H\}$.  
For each skill, a human user performs several kinesthetic  demonstrations on the robot.
Particularly, for skill $\mathsf{a}\in \mathsf{A}$, the set of objects involved is given by $\mathsf{O}_{\mathsf{a}} \subseteq \mathsf{O}$ and the set of demonstrations is given by $\boldsymbol{D}_{\mathsf{a}}=\{\mathsf{D}_1,\cdots, \mathsf{D}_{M_{\mathsf{a}}}\}$, where each demonstration $\mathsf{D}_m$ is a {timed} sequence of states $\mathbf{s}\in \mathbf{s}$ that consists of the end-effector state $\boldsymbol{r}$ and object states $\{\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathsf{o}}, \, \mathsf{o}\in \mathsf{O}_{\mathsf{a}}\}$, i.e.,
$\mathsf{D}_m = \big[\mathbf{s}_t\big]_{t=1}^{T_m} = \left[\big(\boldsymbol{r}_t, \,\{\boldsymbol{p}_{t,\mathsf{o}}, \, \mathsf{o}\in \mathsf{O}_{\mathsf{a}}\} \big)\right]_{t=1}^{T_m}$.
Via a combination of these skills, the objects can be manipulated to reach different states. 

We consider a generic manipulation \emph{task}, which however consists of many {instances}. 
Each problem instance is specified by an initial state~$\mathbf{s}_0$ and a set of desired goal states $\mathbf{s}_G$. 
A task is solved when the system state is changed from $\mathbf{s}_0$ to $\mathbf{s}_G$.
Then the problem statement is as follows:
\begin{problem}\label{main-problem}
Given a new task $(\mathbf{s}_0,\,\mathbf{s}_G)$, determine (i) the discrete sequence of skills; 
and (ii) the continuous robot trajectory to execute each skill. \hfill $\blacksquare$
\end{problem}

We are interested in solving complex manipulation tasks where the sequence of desired skills and the associated trajectories change significantly within different scenarios.
