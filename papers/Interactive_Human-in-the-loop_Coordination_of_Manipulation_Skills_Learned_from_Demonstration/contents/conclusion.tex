\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This work proposes a human-in-the-loop coordination framework for LfD skills that
constructs and learns a geometric task network on-the-fly from human instructions.
The resulting framework is data-efficient and intuitive even for non-technical operators.  
Future work involves the composition of various GTNs and interactive teaching.
