In this paper, we identify and propose a solution to an important but rarely studied problem: transferring knowledge between tasks with drastically different observation spaces where inter-task mappings are not available. 
We propose to learn a latent dynamics model in the source task and transfer the model to the target task to facilitate representation learning. Theoretical analysis and empirical study justify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
