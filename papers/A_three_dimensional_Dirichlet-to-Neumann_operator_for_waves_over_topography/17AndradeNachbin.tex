\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Surface water waves are considered propagating over highly variable non-smooth topographies. For this  three dimensional 
problem a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN)
operator is constructed  reducing the numerical modeling and evolution to the two dimensional free surface.  The
corresponding Fourier-type operator is defined through a matrix decomposition. The topographic component of the 
decomposition requires special care and a Galerkin method is provided accordingly. One dimensional numerical 
simulations, along the free surface, validate the DtN formulation in the presence of a large amplitude, 
rapidly varying topography.  An alternative, conformal mapping based, method is  used for benchmarking. A two dimensional
simulation in the presence of a Luneburg lens (a particular submerged mound) illustrates the accurate performance of the  
three dimensional DtN operator.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Water wave dynamics in coastal regions, where surface waves are affected by depth variations, is a problem of great 
interest from the environmental point of view as well as due to its mathematical (formulation, theory and computational)
diversity. It is a long  lasting source of problems, with still many challenges. 
The problems are very complex, in particular in the presence of a bottom 
topography. Some of these problems are related to the Euler (potential theory) equations, while others to 
its reduced models, such as the weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive Bousssinesq system. 
The topography may come into the problem 
in a geometric fashion
as a variable boundary or, as a variable coefficient (in an algebraic form).  
Inclusion of  topographic features, in either way, is a relevant physical ingredient of current research interest and has  been
addressed  from  the Analysis viewpoint, as well as regarding 
computational modeling and related issues. 

Non-local water wave formulations make use of the harmonic properties of the velocity potential. In incompressible and 
irrotational flows this has been know for quite some time, in particular in two dimensions. Boundary integral equations
and complex function theory, by the Cauchy  integral formula, have been widely used. The literature is abundant,
accessible and therefore
we will refrain from citing just a few authors. 
Nevertheless the papers cited herein are a  good sources of references. 
More recently non-local formulations through the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator
became popular, both theoretically and numerically. The operator collapses all information onto the free surface.
The dimension of the problem is reduced. For example, the dynamics in a three dimensional fluid body is reduced
to computing  only with information along the two dimensional free surface.  

The non-local operators here considered  arise in the form of Fourier integrals: 
\begin{equation}
F[f](x) = \int\!\!\! \int e^{ik(x-x^\prime)} w(\ka) f(x^\prime) dx^\prime dk.
\end{equation}  
The Fourier operator $F$  acts on $f$, where $w(\ka)$ is the Fourier multiplier (symbol).  If the multiplier
is a polynomial in $k$, then $F$ is a differential operator. 
Due to the presence of the topography in the present formulation, the symbol will be 
$x$-dependent. 

An early derivation is due to \citet{Paul1998}, where the author proposes a Fourier integral equation for the water wave problem. 
Milewski uses the two (linearly independent) hyperbolic functions for harmonically extending 
boundary data into the fluid domain.
By expanding the symbol  appropriately the Fourier integral, to leading order, characterizes a differential 
operator. Milewski then recovers the standard long-wave (asymptotic) equations such as the Benny-Luke, the 
Boussinesq, and the KdV equations. His models incorporate  topographical effects through 
variable coefficients and forcing terms. These approximations are valid when the topographical 
variations are slowly varying  with respect to the wave field.

Recently the non-local formulation proposed by \cite{AFM}  has called attention as an  
alternative water wave modeling. The authors 
derive a set of global relations that couple free surface equations together with Fourier components. The Fourier 
components expressed through hyperbolic functions, when expanded, given rise to differential operators defined
as powers of the wavenumber $k$ in Fourier space. Hereafter the formulation proposed in 
\cite{AFM} will be called the AFM formulation.
\citet{OliverasDeconinck} used the AFM formulation to compute periodic traveling wave solutions. 
Their work  represents one of the first steps towards the use of the AFM (non-local) equations
in the  numerical simulation of water waves.
They studied wave stability, showing that it is possible to solve the non-local equations accurately. 

The AFM formulation has been considered in other water wave problems, as for example by
\citet{AblowitzHaut} for internal waves and by \cite{AshtonFokas} for waves with vorticity.

\citet{VasanDeconinck} made a contribution in the context of time dependent AFM simulations, 
in the presence of a topography. Their goal was the recover the bottom profile 
from surface measurements. This task required  an accurate time dependent numerical modeling.
Long, small amplitude waves were used for the bottom reconstruction. 
The dispersion parameter $\mu$ (the ratio between wavelength $\lambda$ and depth $h$) was set to $0.016$ 
in most of the simulations.
Attention was paid on the number of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the bottom accurately. 
The smooth obstacles considered were wavy bottoms and Gaussian mounds, among others. Their amplitude 
ranged up to $25\%$ of the total depth of the fluid. 
In most cases the typical number of Fourier modes is about 12 for the bottom and around 60 for the wave. 
As  discussed in detail in \citet{VasanDeconinck}, the use of a large number of Fourier modes can become an issue, in 
particular in the presence of a topography and of moderate values of $\mu$.

A very detailed comparison between five different  
Dirichlet-to-Neumann formulations  is provided by \citet{WilkeningVasan}. 
They compare expansion methods against methods for solving the non-local equations directly. 
They focus on the two dimensional non-linear regime with a flat bottom.
Among others they consider the AFM-method as well as their dual formulation,
called the AFM$^*$-method. The formulation found in  \citet{Paul1998,CSNG} is namely an AFM$^*$-method. 
\citet{WilkeningVasan} propose the use of  arbitrary precision to deal with the ill-conditioned nature of the problem. 
Our formulation follows the line of \cite{Paul1998} (AFM$^*$ formulation) together with a Galerkin method,
leading to accurate results in the presence of highly variable topographies, including in three dimensions. 


Non-local equations in the presence of topography also appear in the work of \citet{CSNG}. The authors define the 
respective Fourier multiplier operators as will be briefly described.

Having in mind their work  
from \citet{CraigSulem}, they  show that the topographical contribution is given by an extra term in the
Fourier representation. 
For simplicity, consider the Fourier multiplier operator-notation in two dimensions, ignoring for a
moment the time-dependence of the potential:
\begin{equation}
\phi(x,z) = \int\!\!\! \int e^{ik(x-x^\prime)}\frac{\cosh(k(z+h))}{\cosh(kh)} q(x^\prime) dx^\prime dk\equiv
\frac{\cosh((z+h)D)}{\cosh(h D)} q(x),
\end{equation}  
where $D\equiv i\partial x$.  It is easy to see, by separation of variables,  that the Fourier integral 
representation of the potential  satisfies Laplace's equation in a two dimensional strip, of height  $h$, together
with the following boundary conditions: a 
homogeneous Neumann condition at the bottom $z=-h$ and a Dirichlet condition $\phi(x,0)=q(x)$ at the top
boundary $z=0$. 
In three dimensions the notation becomes $D= (D_1,D_2)^T\equiv i(\partial x,\partial y)^T$. In the presence of a 
bottom topography $z=-(h+H(\x))$ the Fourier operator has an additional term in order to account for  the presence
of the topography $H(\x), ~\x=(x,y)$. \citet{CSNG} present their ansatz  by expressing the velocity potential as
\begin{equation}
\phi(\x,z)=\frac{\cosh((z+h)|D|)}{\cosh(h|D|)} q(\x) + \sinh(z|D|)L(H) q(\x).
\label{CSNG}
\end{equation}
The Fourier operator  $L(H)$ is defined implicitly  (see equation (2.23) and Appendix in \cite{CSNG}),
 through  a relation which contains two, topography dependent, Fourier operators $A(H)$ and $B(H)$:
\begin{eqnarray} 
A(H) =  \sinh(H(\x)|D|)\sech(h|D|), ~ ~ ~C(H)= \cosh((H(\x)-h)|D|),\\
 \mbox{with}~ B(H)=C(H)^{-1} \nonumber.
\end{eqnarray}

In their appendix, assuming that the bottom topography is small with respect to the reference depth,  
\cite{CSNG} give a series expansion for the topographical operator. 
The authors comment, in the conclusions,  that {\it ``Preliminary numerical results appear in
\cite{GuyenneNicholls}. More in-depth numerical computations constitute a substantial contribution in their own right(...)."} 
\citet{GuyenneNicholls} considered  expansions for the wave and the bottom topography operators. 
Their model was used to simulate the shoaling of solitary waves propagating over inclined planes. High-frequency 
instabilities were reported and treated with a low-pass filter for the velocity potential and wave elevation functions.
However it is not clear what is exactly the source of the instability. 
As reported by the authors,  it could be due to the ill-possedness of the truncation process that arises 
in the wave expansion, as recently investigated by \citet{Ambrose}, or  it could be due to the topographic operator
component?

In the present work we focus on the topographic component of the Fourier operator
which  is computed numerically as a matrix decomposition,
along the lines mentioned above.  Our ansatz for the topographic component is different from that 
displayed in (\ref{CSNG}) and follows the simpler expression given by \cite{Paul1998}.  
We take into account highly variable non-smooth topographies, 
which inhibits the use of a series expansion. A physically-motivated Galerkin method
acts only on low frequencies of the topographic component of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator, keeping only modes that can indeed interact with the bottom variations. 
The velocity potential $\phi$ and the wave elevation $\eta$ are not filtered. 
Hence with the ingredients we considered the topographic-formulation, along the lines of \cite{Paul1998} and  \cite{CSNG}, 
performed very well for a range of nontrivial problems. These include large amplitude rapidly varying topographies, as well as
three dimensional landscapes, where the non-local formulation had not been tested before. 
Three dimensional simulations can be very time consuming and the Galerkin method played an important role. 

A recent work by \citet{Cathala} regards the analysis and two dimensional computations with the formulation provided by \cite{CSNG}. 
Cathala takes a second order expansion in both the wave  and the topographic operators. 

\citet{Cathala}  considers, in particular, the case of polygonal topographies: a submerged step that rises 
up to half the depth of the channel. He compares his result with that of \citet{Nachbin2003} and 
obtains a satisfactory comparison.
Based on conformal mapping, Nachbin considers a Boussinesq system in the presence of a polygonal topography. 



In another recent work,  \citet{VargasPanayotaros} use the series expansion of \citet{CSNG} and deduce a 
Whitham-Boussinesq model with topography. The numerical modeling is two dimensional.
Their approach simplifies the contribution of the topographic operators 
by introducing a simpler non-local equation. They show that their operator captures the right asymptotic behaviour 
for the high wavenumbers. Their numerical scheme also uses a Galerkin approximation similar to ours and is tested for
a smooth submerged Gaussian mound.

The references mentioned  base their numerical methods on  series expansions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. 
However as pointed out by \citet{CSNG}, when the topography profile is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ a Taylor expansion 
is not what one should seek. 

In summary, the technique here presented is validated 
for solving the nontrivial linear water wave problems in three dimensions. The method uses a non-local 
formulation that reduces the evolution system to a two dimensional surface. As our main 
goal, a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator
is constructed in the presence of large amplitude, non-smooth 
topographies retaining, along the two dimensional surface, information from the vertical flow structure.  
A Galerkin method in Fourier space is used to make the topographic component of the DtN operator
amenable to accurate computations. 

This article is organized as follows. In section 2 we  introduce the potential theory equations and the associated
elliptic boundary value problem for constructing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator over a flat bottom. 
Section 3 considers  the variable-depth non-local formulation and the associated decomposition for the 
three dimensional DtN operator.
Section 4 presents several water wave simulations in two and three dimensions. 
The conclusions are given in section 5.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have constructed a  Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator  for a three dimensional (surface) water wave problem in the 
presence of  highly variable, non-smooth, topographies.  The DtN operator captures the vertical structure of the flow and
allows the three dimensional problem to be reduced to a two dimensional surface. The few existing articles on the DtN 
formulation in the presence of topography consider mostly small amplitude, smooth bottom variations.  Due to memory and
numerical stability issues, the three dimensional (3D) problem had not been explored numerically. By using a Galerkin projection
onto the relevant modes that indeed interact with the topography, we have been able to exhibit several accurate simulations
in the presence of non-trivial bottom profiles. 

In particular we considered a circular submerged mound that plays the role of a Luneburg lens, known in optics. The mound
bends the wave front, through refraction, focusing the energy behind the lens.  Our 3D DtN  formulation captured quite accurately 
the focusing/refraction of the incident plane wave. Using an approximate ray theory for the dispersive (long) wave formulation
we showed that the focusing point is found with excellent accuracy.
