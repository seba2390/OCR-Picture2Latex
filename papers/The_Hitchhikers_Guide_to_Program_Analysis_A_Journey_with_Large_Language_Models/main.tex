\title{The Hitchhiker's Guide to Program Analysis: A Journey with Large Language Models}


\input{abbr}



%%
%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}


Static analysis is a widely used technique in software engineering for identifying and mitigating bugs. 
However, a significant hurdle lies in achieving a delicate balance between precision and scalability. 
\acp*{LLM} offer a promising alternative, as recent advances demonstrate remarkable capabilities in comprehending, generating, and even debugging code. Yet, the logic of bugs can be complex and require sophisticated reasoning and a large analysis scope spanning multiple functions. 
Therefore, at this point, LLMs are better used in an assistive role to complement static analysis. 
In this paper, we take a deep dive into the open space of LLM-assisted static analysis, using use-before-initialization (UBI) bugs as a case study. 
To this end, we develop \work, a fully automated framework that interfaces with both a static analysis tool and an LLM. By carefully designing the framework and the prompts, we are able to overcome a number of challenges, including bug-specific modeling, the large problem scope, the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, etc.
Tested in a real-world scenario analyzing nearly a thousand potential UBI bugs produced by static analysis, \work demonstrates a potent capability, showcasing a reasonable precision (50\%) and appears to have no missing bug. It even identified 13 previously unknown UBI bugs in the Linux kernel. 
%\work also underscores the untapped potential of LLMs in enhancing the precision and scalability of static analysis.
This research paves the way for new opportunities and methodologies in using LLMs for bug discovery in extensive, real-world datasets. 
%Committed to advancing the field, all work and experimental data will be released publicly, providing a fertile ground for further exploration at the intersection of AI and static program analysis.
