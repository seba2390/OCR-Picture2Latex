\section{Conclusion}
We mimic the complex fact-checking process in an automated framework, \model{}, that aggregates consistency signals and consensus from multi-modal evidence found on the Web, and the given \textbf{\textcolor{myOrange}{image}}-\textbf{\textcolor{myblue}{caption}} pairing. Our work significantly outperforms previous baselines and offers a new task and benchmark of multi-modal fact-checking, and an automated, inspectable tool to assist manual fact-checking.
