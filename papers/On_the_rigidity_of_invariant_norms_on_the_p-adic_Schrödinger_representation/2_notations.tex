$p$ is a prime number and we fix an algebraic closure $\Q_p^{al}$ of $\Q_p$.
The absolute value $\abs{}_p$ on $\Q_p$ extends uniquely to $\Q_p^{al}$ and we denote by $\C_p$ the completion of $\Q_p^{al}$ with respect to $\abs{}_p$.
The field $\C_p$ is a complete non-archimedean normed field and algebraically closed.
We denote by $\mathcal{O}_{\C_p}$ the set of elements $a\in\C_p$ with $\pabs{a}\leq 1$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[]$d$ - A fixed integer, $d\geq 1$.
    \item[]$\heis=\heis_{2d+1}(\Q_p)$ - The $2d+1$-dimensional Heisenberg group over $\Q_p$.
    \item[]$Sp_{2d}(\Q_p)$ - The $2d$-dimensional symplectic group.
    \item[]$\Grassmannian$ - The quotient space $P\backslash SL_{2d}(\Q_p)$ of right cosets of the Siegel parabolic $P$. 
    It can be realised as the Grassmannian of maximal isotropic subspaces of a $2d$-dimensional symplectic space.
    \item[]$\schw(X)$ - The space of locally constant and compactly supported functions on a totally disconnected topological space $X$.
    \item[]$\schw=\schw(\Q_p^d)$ - The space of locally constant and compactly supported functions on $\Q_p^d$.
    \item[]$\psi$ - a non-trivial smooth character $\psi:(\Q_p,+)\map \C_p^\times$.
    \item[]$\rho_\psi$ - the Schr√∂dinger representation of $\heis$ on $\schw$ with central character $\psi$.
    \end{itemize}
Assume that $V$ is a representation of a group $G$ over $\C_p$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[]$\Norms(V)^G$ - The set of norms on $V$ which are invariant under the action of $G$.
    \item[]$\Norms(V)_H^G$ - The set of homothety classes of $G$-invariant norms on $V$.
    \end{itemize}
