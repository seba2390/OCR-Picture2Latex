%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist follows the references.  Please
read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
\answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section 1.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
  \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
\end{itemize}
Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.
