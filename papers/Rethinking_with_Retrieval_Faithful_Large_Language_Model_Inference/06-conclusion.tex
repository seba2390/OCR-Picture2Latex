\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the proposed approach is a promising solution for utilizing external knowledge to assist LLMs. Unlike traditional methods, \NAME{} does not require additional training or fine-tuning, making it a lightweight and feasible option for LLMs. Through extensive experiments on three reasoning tasks using GPT-3, we have shown that \NAME{} is able to produce more faithful explanations and improve the performance of LLMs.  In the future, we plan to investigate various variations of \NAME{} to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency in augmenting LLMs with external knowledge. 

%Additionally, we intend to apply our proposal to a broader range of tasks using different LLMs.
