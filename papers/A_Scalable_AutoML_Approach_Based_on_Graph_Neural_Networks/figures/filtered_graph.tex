  \caption{Our {\GML} graph of the graph from Figure \ref{static_analysis}, where the abstracted ML pipeline is linked to a dataset node (highlighted in Orange). {\GML} contains at least 96\% less nodes and edges than the original graph while enhancing the overall quality of the graph generation process, as experimented in Section~\ref{sec:study}.  
  %This interconnection is essential to train the {\sysname} meta-learning model.
