Adversarial games show win rate (higher is better) and harm rate (lower is better) from the learning agent toward the independent agent. Cells are shaded green where performance exceeded Sympathy. Cells have bold text where intended considerate behaviour or comparable win rates were achieved, compared to Selfish run.}

Table \ref{table:win_harm_door} shows the Win Rate and Door Open rate for the two Assistive environments, as well as the Win Rate and Harm Rate (rate at which the learning agent harms the independent agent) for each of the adversarial experiments. Cells highlighted in green show where the EMOTE architecture or \emph{Benchmarks} had similar or better performance than the \emph{Sympathy} baseline. Cells with bold text indicate better or similar performance to the \emph{Selfish} baseline. 

In the Assistive environments, the \emph{E-Feature} and \emph{E-Image} EMOTE baselines result in high win and door open rates, producing similar or better results to the \emph{Sympathy} baseline, with it at times even outperforming the \emph{Benchmarks}. In adversarial environments, all harm rates were lower than the \emph{Selfish} baseline. \emph{E-Feature}, \emph{E-Image} and the \emph{Benchmarks} outperformed \emph{Sympathy} (state-of-the-art baseline) with a lower harm rate, and produced higher win rates. The \emph{Benchmarks} produced lower harm rates than EMOTE however. The win rates of other baselines compared to \emph{Selfish} were either similar (Adversarial 1) or lower (Adversarial 2).  Overall, EMOTE induced more considerate behaviours than \emph{Sympathy}.
%(harming agent As a result of this, the learning agent infers that how the independent agent behaves when the button status is active (when the learning agent has the ability to harm) is much the same as how itself feels when the independent agent can harm. The reverse is true for situations when the button status is inactive.
