In the adversarial environment, the harm rate of the sympathy, empathy (all versions) and benchmark models are lower than that of the selfish agent. Though the win rates were not as high as the selfish agent (however close), our approach was able to outperform the Sympathy baseline (where performance decreased over time). For the empathetic run where the button status was manually swapped, performance was better in terms of reducing the harm rate compared to the case of the modeled button. 
%(harming agent As a result of this, the learning agent infers that how the independent agent behaves when the button status is active (when the learning agent has the ability to harm) is much the same as how itself feels when the independent agent can harm. The reverse is true for situations when the button status is inactive.
