\section{Final Remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we studied the important problem of subspace skyline discovery over datasets with categorical attributes.
We first designed a data structure for organizing tuples in candidate skyline list that supports efficient dominance check operations. We then propose two algorithms ST-S and ST-P algorithms for answering subspace skyline queries for the case where precomputed indices are absent. Finally, we considered the existence of precomputed sorted lists and developed TA-SKY,
the first threshold style algorithm for skyline discovery. 
In addition to the theoretical analysis, our comprehensive set of experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirmed the superior performance of our algorithms.
