In this work, we presented a new UDA approach with a more realistic assumption that the subtype-wise conditional and label shifts widely exist, and can be adaptively aligned without the subtype label. We systematically investigate a flexible yet principled solution for the case with and without the prior knowledge of subtype numbers. Rather than the concise $k$-means, we further extend our framework with an online sub-graph scheme using the reliability-path, which can be scalable to many classes and subtypes with a few meta hyperparameters. The effectiveness of explicitly enforcing the subtype-aware compactness has been successfully demonstrated in the CHD transfer task.   


%Our alternatively updated dynamic memory stack and centroids module can be a practical solution to process the imbalanced and undersampled subtypes.
