	%\boldmath
	The correlations of multiple renewable power plants (RPPs) should be fully considered in the power system with very high penetration renewable power integration. This paper models the uncertainties, spatial correlation of multiple RPPs based on Copula theory and actual probability historical histograms by one-dimension distributions for economic dispatch (ED) problem. An efficient dynamic renewable power scenario generation method based on Gibbs sampling is proposed to generate renewable power scenarios considering the uncertainties, spatial correlation and variability (temporal correlation) of multiple RPPs, in which the sampling space complexity do not increase with the number of RPPs. Distribution-based and scenario-based methods are proposed and compared to solve the real-time ED problem with multiple RPPs. Results show that the proposed dynamic scenario generation method is much more consist with the actual renewable power. The proposed ED methods show better understanding for the uncertainties, spatial and temporal correlations of renewable power and more economical compared with the traditional ones.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper considers the uncertainties and correlations of multiple RPPs in real-time economic dispatch problems. We propose two methods, distribution-based and scenario-based dispatch models that take into account of system reserve and transmission congestion. We propose a scenario generation method that greatly reduces the required computational complexity and can accurately represent renewable power uncertainties, spatial correlation and variability. Results show that although the scenario-based RTED method has a better consideration in the effect of uncertainties and correlations on the system in theory, the discrete feature of scenarios after reduction greatly reduces the effect. Compared with other RTED models, the proposed methods show better economy by capturing renewable power uncertainties, spatial correlation and variability.
