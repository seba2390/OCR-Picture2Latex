%The context
%{\it ``Almost all combinatorial questions can be reformulated as either a matching or a covering problem of a hypergraph''.}  
%This sentence is a quote from a 2-sentence abstract from a rigorous 92-page  mathematical article.
We consider {\em instances of bipartite  graphs}  and a number of asymptotic performance experiments in three projects: 
(1) top movie lists, %given databases of movies and viewers, 
(2) maximum matchings, and 
(3) minimum set covers.
Experiments are designed to measure the asymptotic runtime performance of abstract data types (ADTs) in three programming languages: Java, \R{}, and C++.
%
The outcomes of these experiments may be surprising.
%
In project (1), the best ADT in \R{} consistently outperforms all ADTs in public domain Java libraries, including the library from Google. 
The largest movie list has $2^{20}$ titles.
%
In project (2), the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implementation in \R{} significantly outperforms Java.
The hardest instance has 88452 rows and 729 columns.
%
In project (3),  
a stochastic version of a greedy algorithm 
in R can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art stochastic
solver in C++ on instances with 
$num\_rows \ge 300$ and $num\_columns \ge 3000$. 
%As outlined in the Appendix, this paper represents the first phase of a master class {\tt rBed} project, 
%designed to introduce students to computational experiments that include questions such as 
%(1): is the experiment precise so that the results are reproducible?, and 
%(2): is the experiment accurate, so that the results approach the true values?
