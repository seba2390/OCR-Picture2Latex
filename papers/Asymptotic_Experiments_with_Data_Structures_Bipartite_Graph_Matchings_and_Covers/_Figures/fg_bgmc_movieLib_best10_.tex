\caption{
These two plots relate results for the largest movie list with $2^{20}$ titles.
The plot (a) depicts the frequency of top 10 movies watched. For example, the movie with index 1 has been watched 9 times, movies with indices 2-9 have been watched 8 times, etc. 
\\
The plot (b) counts the total number of movies watched. For example, 385128 movies have been watched only once (index = 1), 75 movies have been watched 7 times (index = 7), only one movie has been watched 9 times (index = 9).
