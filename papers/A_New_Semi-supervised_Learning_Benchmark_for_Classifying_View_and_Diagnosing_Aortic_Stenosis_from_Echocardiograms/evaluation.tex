% \paragraph{Performance metrics.} Throughout this paper, we consider several task-appropriate performance metrics.

%Throughout this paper, for the 3-way view and 3-way diagnosis tasks, we consider \emph{balanced accuracy} as our primary performance metric of interest. This is important because standard accuracy numbers do not adequately reflect performance on tasks with \emph{imbalance}, as our tasks have. For example, on our view classification test set, the ``Other'' category is far more common, representing over 80\% of all images. Trivally guessing ``Other'' for every image would thus reach over 80\% accuracy, but only 33.3\% balanced accuracy.

% Later, for patient-level diagnosis, we also consider FPR at TPR 99\%. 

%% Other 4559-5027 = 4800 = 0.84
%% PLAX   624-646  =  640 = 0.11
%% PSAX   172-212  =  200 = 0.37
