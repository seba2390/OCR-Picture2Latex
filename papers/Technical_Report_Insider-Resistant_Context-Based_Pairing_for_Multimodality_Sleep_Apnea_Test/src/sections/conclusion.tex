We presented SIENNA, a novel insider-resistant context-based pairing scheme for multi-modality OSA screening systems. By merging fuzzy commitment, friendly jamming, and JADE-ICA, SIENNA leverages the unique patterns of a person's breathing dynamics for secure pairing with the presence of co-located attackers. We formally analyzed the security of SIENNA according to the attacker's knowledge of the extracted binary sequence. Our results show that the combination of fuzzy commitment, friendly jamming, and JADE-ICA in SIENNA can protect the security key during the pairing process against an attacker equipped with complete knowledge of the context information, and is robust within a noisy at-home environment with multiple persons. In the future, we plan to further optimize SIENNA in terms of power consumption and execution time.
