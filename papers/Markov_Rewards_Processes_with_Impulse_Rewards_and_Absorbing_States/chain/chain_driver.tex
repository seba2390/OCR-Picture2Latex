\section{Markov Rewards Processes with Impulse Rewards and Absorbing States}
\label{sec:markov}

	We study the expected accumulated reward for a discrete-time Markov reward model with absorbing states. The rewards are impulse rewards, where a reward $\rew{i}{j}$ is accumulated when transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$.  We derive an explicit, single-letter expression for the expected accumulated reward as the number of time steps $n \to \infty$.
