\caption{\textbf{Sweeping sampling schedule.} Schedules expressed as a sequence of integers which are numbers of steps assigned to one-third of the diffusion process. 130-60-60 implies consuming more steps near $t=0$. Modifying the sampling schedule can slightly improve performance, but does not exceed our improvement. %Even doubling sampling steps of the baseline is inferior to our result.
