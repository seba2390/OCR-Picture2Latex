\section{Implementation}
\rev{\tool{}\footnote{Source code available at \url{https://github.com/KeriYuu/Wakey-Wakey}.} was implemented as a client/server web application.
The front end was built with \texttt{Vue} for user interactions.
The computational framework for generating kinetic typography was implemented in Python.
An automatic generation takes around 300ms/frame (CPU: Intel i7 4.9 GHz).
The \texttt{Flask} framework is used to handle the messaging between the front end and the back end.
