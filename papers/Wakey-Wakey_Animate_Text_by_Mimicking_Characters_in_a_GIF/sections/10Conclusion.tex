\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we explore the opportunity to create expressive kinetic typography based on a driving GIF with character motions.
Based on the unique characteristics of text, we propose a framework that adapts existing motion transfer models to the vector domain.
Specifically, we animate text based on their control points predefined in font specification.
To mimic the motion while maintaining fair legibility, the by-frame positions of each control point are regularized by the extracted motion key point in the driving GIF and neighboring control points.
We also introduce an interaction module that allows human-computer collaboration, where humans can steer the intermediate results and guide the generation of kinetic typography.
Based on the framework, we developed a mixed-initiative authoring tool and a browser widget featuring automatic generation.
A questionnaire study (N=33) initially validated the effectiveness of our approach.
Participants generally recognized that the results were animated in a desirable manner, both aesthetically pleasing and semantically resonant.
Moreover, we evaluated the novel transfer-based kinetic typography tools by organizing a workshop (N=20) with both general users and professional designers.
People were positive about the interactive system and showed interest in employing our tools for various scenarios.
