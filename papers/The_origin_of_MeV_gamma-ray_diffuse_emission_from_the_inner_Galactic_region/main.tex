%%% Intro
%MeV gap? Feedback on Galaxy evolution? approved COSI?
The MeV gamma-ray domain is the only unexplored window among recent multiwavelength observations in astrophysics, often referred to as the ``MeV gap''.
One of the open issues in MeV gamma-ray astrophysics is the origin of diffuse emission from the inner Galactic region.
%Investigation of this diffuse emission covers several important facets, including the Galactic diffuse emission from low-energy (sub-GeV) \acp{cr}, individual MeV gamma-ray objects, and/or new populations of MeV gamma-ray radiation originated from dark matter or neutrinos.
%Thus, the study of the MeV gamma-ray diffuse emission would have a lot of influence on these broad topics, especially in the next decade when some missions will give us a new insight into the MeV gap.
%
%%% COMPTEL excess
The Imaging Compton Telescope \comptel\ onboard the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) reported the detection of diffuse emission of 10$^{-2}$ \Mflux\ in 1--30 MeV from the inner Galactic region with $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15\degr$ \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011,strong_diffuse_1996}.
%This measurement revealed that the emission was actually diffuse, also confirmed by OSSE \citep{strong_diffuse_1996}, and consistent with the result of COS-B \citep{strong_radial_1988}.
%The \comptel\ diffuse emission was calculated as follows. The gamma-ray intensity model consisted of \ac{gde} (i.e., radiation from interactions of \acp{cr} with gas and photon fields), source (only Crab), and an isotropic term. The instrumental background, which dominated the detected gamma-ray events, was implemented with a fixed spectral shape \citep{strong_diffuse_1994}. The overall fit was performed by combining the gamma-ray intensity model weighted by the response function and the instrumental background. Based on the best-fit parameters of \ac{gde}, the aforementioned diffuse emission was estimated.
This emission was derived by considering the instrumental background and \ac{cgb}, thus it would contain \ac{gde} and unresolved sources.
%There are several results of the \comptel\ diffuse emission obtained with different models, data (observation phase), and size of the inner Galactic region \citep{strong_diffuse_1994,strong_diffuse_1996,strong_diffuse_2004,bouchet_diffuse_2011}, and the latest one with $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15\degr$ \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011} is presented in this proceeding.
Recently, the inner Galactic diffuse emission has been confirmed by other observations such as \spi\ \cite{siegert_diffuse_2022} and the electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the balloon mission of SMILE-2$+$ \cite{takada_first_2022}.

The origin of the inner Galactic diffuse emission has been in active debate. 
If the \ac{gde} model to account for the diffuse emission by \lat\ \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012} is extrapolated to the MeV energy range, 
there is an apparent excess component (e.g., \cite{strong_diffuse_2004}), which is commonly referred to as the \comptel\ excess.
There are several scenarios for reproducing the \comptel\ excess:
(1) Individual MeV gamma-ray sources should be taken into consideration. 
%Only the Crab was considered when calculating the \comptel\ emission, although \comptel\ detected 25 steady sources \citep{Schonfelder2000}. Furthermore, sources which were not resolved by \comptel\ would also have a fraction of the contribution. 
(2) There are non-negligible uncertainties on the model of \ac{gde}, since it has a lot of unconstrained parameters (e.g., photon field densities, \ac{cr} source distribution, \ac{cr} injection spectra, and propagation mechanism).
Enhancement of one or more of these parameters can make \ac{gde} higher to reach the \comptel\ excess \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011}.
(3) New populations, such as annihilation or decay of dark matter \citep{boddy_indirect_2015} and/or cascaded gamma rays accompanying cosmic neutrinos \citep{fang_tev_2022}, might be present.

The origin of the inner Galactic diffuse emission by \comptel\ has been in active debate. 
%%% Fermi diffuse
%Almost two decades since its discovery, an all-sky gamma-ray survey by \lat\ unveiled the detailed spectroscopy of the diffuse emission in the GeV energy band. It revealed that the diffuse emission observed by \lat\ was fairly explained by a combination of the \ac{gde}, resolved GeV gamma-ray sources, and extragalactic gamma-ray background (i.e., \ac{cgb}) \citep{ackermann_fermi_2012}. Note that some locally characteristic radiation, such as the \fermi\ bubble and the Galactic center excess, still remain elusive \citep{su_giant_2010,ackermann_fermi_2017,murgia_fermilat_2020}.
If the \ac{gde} model of \lat\ is extrapolated to the MeV energy range, 
there is an apparent excess component to account for the \comptel\ emission (e.g., \citealt{strong_diffuse_2004}), which is commonly referred to as the \comptel\ excess.
There are several scenarios for reproducing the \comptel\ excess:

(2) There are non-negligible % (more than a factor of few)
uncertainties on the model of \ac{gde}, since it has a lot of unconstrained parameters (e.g., photon field densities, \ac{cr} source distribution, \ac{cr} injection spectra, and propagation mechanism).
Enhancement of one or more of these parameters can make \ac{gde} higher to reach the \comptel\ excess \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011}.
%(3) \ac{cgb} might not be fully subtracted.
(3) New populations, such as annihilation or decay of dark matter \citep{boddy_indirect_2015,christy_indirect_2022,Binder_2022} and/or cascaded gamma rays accompanying cosmic neutrinos \citep{fang_tev_2022}, might be present.

%%% updates since COMPTEL
We address a few updates on observations of the MeV gamma-ray diffuse emission since \comptel.
\integral-SPI measured a spectrum of the diffuse emission in 0.02–2.4 MeV, which comprised a continuum component and four gamma-ray lines (i.e., positron annihilation, $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe lines) \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011}.
The continuum component is consistent with the emission by \comptel\ in the overlapping energy range of 1–2.4 MeV, as shown in \figref{fig:size}.
\cite{bouchet_diffuse_2011} argued that the diffuse emission by \integral-SPI can be roughly reproduced by the standard model of \ac{gde}.
The fit, however, became much improved if they increased the normalization of the primary \ac{cr} electron spectrum or the interstellar radiation field in the Galactic bulge or a large Galactic CR halo.
The latest result of the 0.5--8 MeV observation by \integral-SPI was presented in \cite{siegert_diffuse_2022}.
Using the new analysis with the lower level of signal-to-noise ratio, they confirmed that the obtained diffuse emission showed a mismatch of a factor of 2–3 in normalization with respect to the baseline model of \ac{gde}.
The \spi\ spectra are also illustrated in \figref{fig:size}.
%This may arise from enhanced target photon densities and/or electron source spectra, slightly modified diffusion properties, or an unresolved population of MeV gamma-ray sources.
Besides \spi, the electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the balloon mission of SMILE-2$+$ retrieved a gamma-ray lightcurve %\textcolor{blue}{YI: gamma-ray map?}
in 0.15–2.1 MeV during flight, showing enhanced gamma rays when it was pointing at the vicinity of the Galactic center \citep{takada_first_2022}.

The inner Galactic diffuse emission in MeV}

\subsection{MeV gamma-ray sources}
\label{sec:sources}

%%% Summary of \bat\ and \lat\ cross-match. (Tsuji+ 2021)
Although the previous studies (e.g., \cite{strong_diffuse_1996,orlando_imprints_2018,siegert_diffuse_2022}) proposed that the \comptel\ excess would be attributed by radiation from individual unresolved sources,
the quantitative estimation has not been done yet.
We estimate this source contribution from a MeV gamma-ray source catalog in \cite{tsuji_cross-match_2021}, which presented a crossmatching between the 105-month \bat\ \citep{Bird2016} and 10-yr \lat\ (4FGL-DR2) \cite{4fgldr2} catalogs, resulting in 156 point-like and 31 extended crossmatched sources.
%Note that among them, 136 point sources and 15 extended sources are firmly matched (i.e., the hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission are originated from the same source), and 16 sources were actually detected by \comptel\ \citep{tsuji_cross-match_2021}.
These crossmatched sources, which are both hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emitters, are prominent sources in the MeV gamma-ray sky.
%
%%% source breakdown 
Among them,
19 point sources and 14 extended sources are located in the inner Galactic region with $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15\degr$.
%The point sources compose three blazars, three pulsars, one X-ray binary (RX J1826.2$-$1450), Galactic center (Sgr A$^\star$), one globular cluster (ESO 520$-$27), four unidentified sources, and six false matches\footnote{Falsely matched sources indicate spatially crossmatched sources, but the hard X-ray (\bat) and gamma-ray (\lat) sources are different origins \citep{tsuji_cross-match_2021}.}. 
%The extended sources are six PNWe, two SNRs, four spp\footnote{Sources that are candidates of SNR or PNW.}, an unidentified source, and a false match.


%%% Fitting Model
We jointly fit the \acp{sed} of \bat\ in 14--195 keV and \lat\ in 50 MeV--300 GeV.
%We adopt a log-parabola model first.  The log-parabola model can be applied to most of the sources, in particular blazars like \acp{fsrq} or pulsars, of which the MeV gamma-ray radiation is originated from a single electron population.
%We find that nine sources (one pulsar, three false-matched sources, one globular cluster, one unidentified, Galactic center, one PWN, and one spp) cannot be well fitted by the log-parabola model, inferred from a large reduced chi-squared of $>$10. For these sources, we adopt a two-component model, which is a superposition of the models in the \bat\ and \lat\ catalogs.
%Additionally, we also use the same two-component model for \rxj, because it is a \ac{snr}, of which the X-ray and gamma-ray emission do not originate from the same process. Likewise, a choice of the fitting model may cause uncertainty on the source flux.
For the fitting model, we adopt log-parabola or two-component models, depending on the sources. The two-component model is a superposition of the models in the \bat\ and \lat\ catalogs.
%We checked that the choice of the fitting model (i.e., log-parabola or broken power-law models) does not have a large effect on the undermentioned result.
%
%%% Contribution to COMPTEL excess
Based on the best-fit model %\revise{
determined by the minimum $\chi^2$, we estimate spectra in the MeV gamma-ray energy range, sum up all the spectra of the 33 sources in the inner Galactic region, and divide it by the region size.
The result of the accumulated source spectrum is shown in \figref{fig:model}.
The contribution of all crossmatched sources to the \comptel\ excess is about 10\%. 
%The result is shown in \figref{fig:model}.
%The contribution of all crossmatched sources to the \comptel\ excess is about 10\%. 
%and the ratio of the point sources to the extended sources is roughly 1–1.5.
%It should be noted that if we select only the firmly matched sources in the inner Galactic region (nine point-like and 12 extended sources), the total source contribution is reduced to 60--80\% of the spectrum shown in \figref{fig:model}.
See \cite{tsuji_2022} for details.


%%% unmatched sources
Besides the crossmatched sources in \cite{tsuji_cross-match_2021}, there exist many unmatched sources that would have a significant contribution accumulatively.
In the region with $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15\degr$, there are 152 \bat\ and 708 \lat\ sources, where the crossmatched sources are excluded.
%We assume that 
These unmatched sources (860 in total) would be fainter than $10^{-12}$ \flux\ in the MeV energy band since they are not detected by \bat\ or \lat, with the sensitivity being approximately 10$^{-12}$~\flux.
%Then, 
%\revise{
If we assume each unmatched source has a flux of  $10^{-12}$ \flux,
the accumulative source flux is $\sim 10^{-3}$ \Mflux, 
which should be considered as an upper limit.
This upper limit flux of the unmatched sources is roughly comparable to that of the crossmatched sources.
Combined with the crossmatched sources, the contribution of the sources is $\sim$20\% of the \comptel\ excess (\figref{fig:model}).
%Compared with the GeV gamma-ray source component by \lat\ \citep{ackermann_fermi_2012} in the region with $|\ell| \leq 80\degr$ and $|b| \leq 10\degr$, our source spectrum is roughly in agreement within a factor of $\sim$2 at 200 MeV.
%Detailed modeling of the unmatched sources will be presented in a future publication.




\subsection{Galactic diffuse emission}
\label{sec:gde}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% GALPROP
To evaluate \acf{gde}, we make use of \galprop\ (version 54 of WebRun), which is designed to calculate astrophysics of \acp{cr} (i.e., propagation and energy loss) and photon emissions in the radio to gamma-ray energy bands \citep{porter_high-energy_2017}.
%%% Models in the literature.
%In this proceeding, we consider three models of \ac{gde} in the literature: one model from \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012} and two models from \cite{orlando_imprints_2018} 
%%% Ackermann+ 2012
%These models are constructed to be reconciled with the gamma-ray observations by \lat\ and the observed \ac{cr} spectra by several \ac{cr} experiments.
%%% Orlando
%Using the results of the latest \ac{cr} measurements with \voyager, \cite{orlando_imprints_2018} modified the \ac{gde} models in the literature, especially the injection parameters of electrons and propagation parameters.
%%%
In this proceeding, we use the \ac{gde} models in the literature \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012,orlando_imprints_2018}, which are developed to be consistent with the \ac{cr} observations by AMS-02 (and \voyager) and the gamma-ray observations by \lat.
A baseline model of 
$^{\rm S}S ^{\rm Z}4 ^{\rm R}20 ^{\rm T}150 ^{\rm C}5$\footnote{This model assumes that the source distribution of \acp{cr} is SNRs, the Galactic disk is characterized by the height of $z=$4 kpc and the galactocentric radius of $R=$20 kpc, and $T_s$=150 K and $E(B-V) = 5 $ mag cut is adopted for determining the gas-to-dust ratio (see \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012} for details).} 
is selected as a representative of the models in \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012} and referred to as Model~1. 
From \cite{orlando_imprints_2018}, we adopt the DRE (i.e., diffusion and re-acceleration) and DRELowV (modified DRE\footnote{
%\revise{
DRE model with some modifications on parameters of diffusion and particle injection in order to reproduce the \ac{cr} measurements \cite{orlando_imprints_2018}.}) models, hereafter referred to as Model 2 and Model~3, respectively.

%%% Compare GDE Model 1-3
Since GDE below $\sim$100 MeV is dominated by the \ac{ic} component, the difference in Models 1--3 arises from \ac{cr} electrons in 0.1--1 GeV.
Models 2 and 3 are respectively the highest and lowest with the difference of a factor of a few, and Model 1 is in the middle of them.
%Model~2 almost can reach the \comptel\ emission, while it is slightly lower than the flux at the lower energy bins. 
Although there is such uncertainty on the \ac{gde} models, $\gtrsim$30\% of the \comptel\ excess is contributed by GDE.

\if0
%%% Example of DGE SED
%\figref{fig:fig1} shows \ac{gde} spectra of Model 1--3.
The \ac{gde} spectra of Model~1, shown in \figref{fig:fig1}, consist of three components of radiation: \ac{ic} scattering, Bremsstrahlung, and pion-decay radiation.
In the energy channel of \comptel, \ac{ic} is dominant, while Bremsstrahlung is subdominant because of ionization loss of electrons at the lower energy, and the hadronic component is less effective due to the pion bump.
The \ac{ic} scattering in the MeV gamma-ray range is attributed to sub-GeV electrons that up-scatter seed photon fields of optical, infrared, and \ac{cmb}.


%%% Compare GDE Model 1-3
\figref{fig:fig1} also compares the aforementioned GDE models, Models 1--3.
Since GDE below $\sim$100 MeV is dominated by the \ac{ic} component, the difference in Models 1--3 arises from \ac{cr} electrons in 0.1–1 GeV (\figref{fig:cr} in Appendix \ref{sec:gde_appendix}).
Models 2 and 3 are respectively the highest and lowest with the difference of a factor of few, and Model 1 is in the middle of them.
Model~2 almost can reach to the \comptel\ emission, while it is slightly lower than the flux at the lower energy bins. This trend is the same for the diffuse emission measured in the different sizes in \figref{fig:size} (Appendix \ref{sec:region_appendix}).
Although there is such uncertainty on the \ac{gde} models, $\gtrsim$30\% of the \comptel\ excess is contributed by GDE.

\figref{fig:model} compares the \comptel\ data points and our models with the three different models of \ac{gde}.
We show the spectrum of MeV gamma-ray sources, \ac{gde} Models~1--3, and the combined spectra of these two components.
It should be noted that this direct comparison did not take into account energy dispersion, which may have a significant effect on the result, as described in the data analysis of \spi\ \citep{strong_gamma-ray_2005}.
%The issue might be large in the \comptel\ data due to its property of functioning as a Compton telescope. Applying the energy response function, however, is beyond the scope of this study, and it is currently impossible because the \comptel\ response is not available. Although a small ($\sim 1\sigma$) difference between the data points of \comptel\ and the models might not be counted as an excess unless the energy dispersion is adequately considered, 
%In the following, we report the results of the direct comparison between the data and the models.
%
%%% Comments on each result.
We find that the combination of \ac{gde} and the sources can roughly reproduce the \comptel\ excess:
the entire spectrum can be sufficiently explained with Model~2 (\figref{fig:model} upper right), and
the lowest and highest energy bins of the \comptel\ data can be reproduced with Model~1 (\figref{fig:model} upper left).
Model~3 (\figref{fig:model} lower left) is slightly lower than the \comptel\ excess.


%%% Region dependence
\if0
The inner Galactic diffuse emission is roughly $10^{-2}$ \Mflux\ for all the previous studies,
however the extracted region is different;
$|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15\degr$ in \cite{bouchet_diffuse_2011}, $|\ell| \leq 60\degr$ and $|b| \leq 10\degr$ in \cite{strong_diffuse_2004}, $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 5\degr$ in \cite{strong_comptel_1999}, $|\ell| \leq 45.7\degr$ and $|b| \leq 45.7\degr$ in \cite{siegert_diffuse_2022}, as illustrated in \figref{fig:size}.
This region difference is crucial for calculating the model.
The trend in \figref{fig:model} is similar if we adopt for the region with  $|\ell| \leq 60\degr$ and $|b| \leq 10\degr$ or  $|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 5\degr$ (see Appendix \ref{sec:region_appendix} for the results with the different regions).
In the region with $|\ell| \leq 45.7\degr$ and $|b| \leq 45.7\degr$, the model fails to reproduce the emission since it is extended to the high-latitude region, where \ac{gde} becomes faint and the number of sources decreases.

The power-law spectral index is $s \sim -1.9$ ($dN/dE \propto E^s$) for the \comptel\ excess.
%, while it is harder with  $s=-1.39$ for the latest measurement of the \spi\ emission in the region extended to the higher latitude \citep{siegert_diffuse_2022}.
\figref{fig:model} shows that the spectrum of the accumulated sources is almost flat in the SED with a spectral index of $s \sim -2$.
Since the \ac{gde} models have $s \sim -1.5$, the MeV gamma-ray sources should play an important role in reproducing the observed spectrum by \comptel\ with $s \sim -1.9$.
More precise measurements of the spectrum of each source will enable constraining the accumulative source spectrum, which in turn will be useful to determine the \ac{gde} spectrum, especially the index of the primary electrons responsible for the \ac{ic} radiation.


%%% Uncertainty of GDE
Since the dominant component in the energy range of the \comptel\ excess is \ac{gde}, the uncertainty of \ac{gde} prevents us from reaching a robust conclusion.
%The uncertainty of \ac{gde} arises from (1) the amount of \ac{cr} electrons and (2) the photon fields being up-scattered by the electrons. 
%%% CR electron
The uncertainty arises from the amount of \ac{cr} electrons.
The CR electrons in 100--1000 MeV, which produce 1--30 MeV photons via \ac{ic} scattering, are different by a factor of $\sim$4, depending on the models. 
To distinguish these models is important in the perspective of \ac{cr} feedback on galaxy evolution:
\acp{cr} can produce a non-thermal pressure gradient and enhance the degree of ionization in molecular clouds, significantly affecting a star-forming activity
(e.g., \cite{hopkins_first_2021}). 
%%% photon fields
The density of the photon fields across the Galaxy is not well constrained, which also makes the \ac{gde} model somewhat uncertain in the MeV gamma-ray band.
If we assume that the interstellar radiation field is locally enhanced, such as in the Galactic bulge or a large Galactic CR halo, \ac{gde} in the inner Galactic region is increased enough to reach the flux level of the \comptel\ excess \citep{bouchet_diffuse_2011}.

%\comment{move this subsection to Discussion section?}

%%% COMPTEL excess includes CGB or not?
%In this section, 
%In addition to the sources and \ac{gde} (\secref{sec:sources} and \secref{sec:gde}) as primary components that must be accounted for the \comptel\ excess, we discuss how much it would be affected by uncertainty of subtraction of \ac{cgb} as a secondary component.
Here, we discuss the uncertainty on the subtraction of \ac{cgb}.
When calculating the \comptel\ emission, there is an isotropic term, $I_B$, in Equation (1) in \cite{strong_diffuse_1994,strong_diffuse_1996}, which likely corresponds to \ac{cgb}.
Later, \cite{strong_comptel_1999,strong_diffuse_2004,bouchet_diffuse_2011} presented the \comptel\ diffuse emission with \ac{cgb} being removed, as the base level (i.e., the zero-flux level) was set to the high-latitude sky.
We need to be cautious, however, of the treatment of the isotropic term: 
First, since the isotropic term is a term with only the normalization being free, the spectral shape of \ac{cgb} was not taken into account. 
Second, the uncertainty of the background subtraction might be included in the isotropic term, although the uncertainty of the overall fit was dominated by systematic errors, estimated to be of order of $\sim$25\%  \citep{strong_diffuse_1994}. 
Therefore, there might be a possibility that the isotropic term could not completely represent \ac{cgb}.


%%% CGB
\ac{cgb} in the MeV gamma-ray band derived from \comptel\ \citep{weidenspointner_cosmic_2000,kappadath_total_1997,
kappadath_measurement_1998} is reproduced by a broken power-law model:
\begin{equation}
    I(E) = 2.2 \times 10^{-4} \left(\frac{E}{3~\mathrm{MeV}} \right)^{-\Gamma} ~  (\mathrm{MeV ~ cm}^2 ~\mathrm{s ~ sr})^{-1} , 
    %% case
    %    \left\{
    %\begin{array}{ll}
    % 2.2 \times 10^{-4} \left(\frac{E}{3~\mathrm{MeV}} \right)^{-3.3}  (E \leq 3~\mathrm{keV}) \\
    %E^{-*}  (E> 3~\mathrm{keV}) \\
    %\end{array} \right.
    \label{eq:CGB}
\end{equation}
where the spectral slope $\Gamma$ is 3.3 for $E \leq 3$ MeV and 2 for $E > 3$ MeV.
This is roughly comparable with the observation of the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) \citep{watanabe_mev_2000}. 
%%% uncertainty of CGB subtraction
A fraction of CGB (\eqref{eq:CGB}) to the \comptel\ excess is approximately 20\%, except for the lowest energy bin of which the fraction is 60\%.
Since this fraction at the higher energy bins is smaller than the systematic uncertainty of 25\%, the \comptel\ data points include the uncertainty of the subtraction of CGB.
\fi


%%% other scenarios
%Although more investigation is necessary to reveal whether there indeed is an excess in the inner Galactic diffuse emission in the MeV gamma-ray energy band, we address the other scenarios besides \ac{gde}, the sources, and \ac{cgb}.
As indicated by Model~3, we would need additional component(s) to reconcile with the \comptel\ emission.
Possible explanations are low-mass ($\lesssim$280 MeV) annihilating dark matter coupling to first-generation quarks \citep{boddy_indirect_2015} and/or 
cascaded gamma rays accompanying cosmic neutrinos \citep{fang_tev_2022},
which would open up a new window for these studies.

This section presents predicted MeV gamma-ray all-sky maps, which would be useful for observation strategies of future missions.
The all-sky map comprises three components: sources, \acf{gde}, and \acf{cgb}.
%%% source
The source map (\figref{fig:allsky}b) consists of 187 crossmatched sources in \cite{tsuji_cross-match_2021}. 
The flux is estimated by fitting the \bat\ and \lat\ \acp{sed} by log-parabola or tow-component models, as mentioned in \secref{sec:sources}.
The extended sources are illustrated as point sources here, but this will be improved in the future work.
%%% Galactic diffuse
The \ac{gde} map (\figref{fig:allsky}c) makes use of Model~1 \cite{ackermann_fermi_2012} described in \secref{sec:gde}.
%%% CGB
For the \ac{cgb} map (\figref{fig:allsky}d), we assume the spectrum in the literature \cite{weidenspointner_cosmic_2000} and the isotropic distribution.


The 1--10 MeV all-sky maps of each component and the total are illustrated in \figref{fig:allsky}.
\ac{gde} is dominant in the low-latitude sky, while it is dominated by \ac{cgb} at the higher latitude.
The flux of \ac{gde} and \ac{cgb} are respectively 0.18--15 and 3.0 in units of $10^{-12}$~\flux,
and 147 sources have flux larger than these values at each location.
Our model predicts that there are 123 and 174 sources with the flux in 1--10 MeV being larger than $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-12}$ \flux, respectively.
These sources would be good targets for future missions \cite{COSI_SMEX,fleischhack_amego-x_2021,Aramaki2020,takada_first_2022}.
%These maps would be helpful for developing a strategy to maximize scientific outcomes of future missions \cite{COSI_SMEX,fleischhack_amego-x_2021,Aramaki2020,takada_first_2022}.

%\comment{describe how many sources} In the inner Galactic region ($|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15$\degr), our source model predicts that there are 5, 26, and 28 sources with the flux in 1--10 MeV being larger than $10^{-10}$, $10^{-11}$, and $10^{-12}$ \flux, respectively.

%\section{Summary} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Future mission. 
\if0
In order to have an advanced understanding of the inner Galactic diffuse emission, observations with much better performance (i.e., greater angular resolution and larger effective area) are desired. 
Such observations have not been achieved in the two decades since \comptel.
There are several ongoing or planned projects of the MeV gamma-ray observation,
such as COSI-SMEX \citep{COSI_SMEX} to be launched as a satellite in 2026,
e-ASTROGAM \citep{eASTROGAM2018}, AMEGO-X \citep{fleischhack_amego-x_2021}, GRAMS \citep{Aramaki2020}, SMILE-3 \citep{takada_first_2022}, GECCO \citep{moiseev_new_2021}, and a CubeSat for MeV observations (MeVCube) \citep{lucchetta_introducing_2022}.
With these future missions, we need to resolve the individual MeV gamma-ray sources first.
In the inner Galactic region ($|\ell| \leq 30\degr$ and $|b| \leq 15$\degr), our source model predicts that there are 5, 26, and 28 sources with the flux in 1--10 MeV being larger than
$10^{-10}$, $10^{-11}$, and $10^{-12}$ \flux, respectively.
%In the inner Galactic region ($|\ell| \leq 60\degr$ and $|b| \leq 10$\degr), our source model predicts that there are 8, 32, and 36 sources with the flux in 1–10 MeV being larger than $10^{-10}$, $10^{-11}$, and $10^{-12}$ \flux, respectively.
These sources can be detectable by the observatory whose sensitivity is improved by 1--2 orders of magnitude from \comptel.
After subtracting the source contribution and \ac{cgb}, we can constrain \ac{gde} with higher accuracy, %, combined with the cosmic-ray, GeV gamma-ray, and synchrotron radio data.
then we can clarify the presence of the \comptel\ excess.
\fi


%\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\if0
We elaborated on models consisting of MeV gamma-ray objects, resulting in $\sim$20\% contribution to the inner Galactic diffuse emission. Combined with \ac{gde}, the \comptel\ emission can be roughly reproduced. 
We also produced and provided preliminary MeV gamma-ray all-sky maps, consisting of the sources, \ac{gde}, and \ac{cgb}.
These maps would be helpful for developing a strategy to maximize scientific outcomes of future missions \cite{COSI_SMEX,fleischhack_amego-x_2021,Aramaki2020,takada_first_2022}.
\fi


\if0
To clarify the origin of the \comptel\ excess, we elaborated on models consisting of MeV gamma-ray objects and \ac{gde}.
The crossmatched sources (both the hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emitters) have contributions of $\sim$10\% to the \comptel\ diffuse emission, and the contribution of the unmatched sources  (either of the hard X-ray or GeV gamma-ray emitters) is also at the same level. 
Although the most uncertain component of \ac{gde} prevents us from a robust conclusion, we found that the combination of all the components can roughly reproduce the \comptel\ excess, except for the \ac{gde} model with the smallest flux. 
With future missions \cite{COSI_SMEX,eASTROGAM2018,fleischhack_amego-x_2021,Aramaki2020,takada_first_2022,moiseev_new_2021,lucchetta_introducing_2022}, 
we would be able to discriminate between the \ac{gde} models, enabling us to determine the amount of low-energy \ac{cr} electrons and characterize their role in the galaxy evolution, and confirm the existence of the \comptel\ excess, opening up a new window for dark matter or neutrinos if it exists.
