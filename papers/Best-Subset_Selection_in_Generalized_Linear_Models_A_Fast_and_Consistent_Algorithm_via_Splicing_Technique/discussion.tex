\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion-and-discussion}

In this paper, we look for algorithms for the best-subset selection problem in GLM that will be useful to statisticians and practitioners.
We devise novel algorithms to pursue high-quality sparse solutions iteratively, and thus,
circumvent the enumeration of all possible subsets.
More importantly, under mild assumptions, we establish best-subset-screening guarantees and polynomial computational complexity for our algorithms in a high-probability sense.
Our research on logistic regression, Poisson regression, and multi-response regression shows that,
equipped with efficient implementation,
the ABESS algorithm has excellent computational and statistical properties.
The ABESS algorithms are packaged in an openly shared R/Python package abess \citep{zhu-abess-arxiv} that can be used by data scientists worldwide.
% More importantly, the proof technique utilized in this paper can be directly applied to
% more sophisticated scenarios like group variable selection \citep{meierGroupLassoLogistic2008, zhangCertifiablyPolynomialAlgorithm2021}.

% Furthermore, our proposal can be applied to causal inference.
% One of the limitation of our approach is the potential violation of Condition~\ref{con:bound-variance}.
% For example, Condition~\ref{con:bound-variance} might violate if the response come from Poisson distributions.
Several intriguing directions should be investigated further. 
One of our future directions is to apply our algorithmic ideas to a broader range of convex optimization problems
