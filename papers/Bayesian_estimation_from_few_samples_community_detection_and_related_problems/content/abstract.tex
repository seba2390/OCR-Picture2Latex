We propose an efficient meta-algorithm for Bayesian estimation problems that is based on low-degree polynomials, semidefinite programming, and tensor decomposition.
The algorithm is inspired by recent lower bound constructions for sum-of-squares and related to the method of moments.
Our focus is on sample complexity bounds that are as tight as possible (up to additive lower-order terms) and often achieve statistical thresholds or conjectured computational thresholds.

Our algorithm recovers the best known bounds for community detection in the sparse stochastic block model, a widely-studied class of estimation problems for community detection in graphs.
We obtain the first recovery guarantees for the mixed-membership stochastic block model (Airoldi et el.) in constant average degree graphs---up to what we conjecture to be the computational threshold for this model.
%
We show that our algorithm exhibits a sharp computational threshold for the stochastic block model with multiple communities beyond the Kesten--Stigum bound---giving evidence that this task may require exponential time.

The basic strategy of our algorithm is strikingly simple:
we compute the best-possible low-degree approximation for the moments of the posterior distribution of the parameters and use a robust tensor decomposition algorithm to recover the parameters from these approximate posterior moments.
