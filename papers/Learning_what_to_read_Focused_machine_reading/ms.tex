% Author information can be set in various styles:
% For several authors from the same institution:
% \author{Author 1 \and ... \and Author n \\
%         Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% if the names do not fit well on one line use
%         Author 1 \\ {\bf Author 2} \\ ... \\ {\bf Author n} \\
% For authors from different institutions:
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \And  ... \And
%         Author n \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% To start a seperate ``row'' of authors use \AND, as in

%         \AND
%         Author 2 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line \And
%         Author 3 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% If the title and author information does not fit in the area allocated,
% place \setlength\titlebox{<new height>} right after
% at the top, where <new height> can be something larger than 2.25in

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recent efforts in bioinformatics have achieved tremendous progress in the machine reading of biomedical literature, and the assembly of the extracted biochemical interactions into large-scale models such as protein signaling pathways. 
However, batch machine reading of literature at today's scale (PubMed alone indexes over 1 million papers per year) is unfeasible due to both cost and processing overhead. In this work,
we introduce a focused reading approach to guide the machine reading of biomedical literature towards {\em what} literature should be read to answer a biomedical query as efficiently as possible. We introduce a family of algorithms for focused reading, including an intuitive, strong baseline, and a second approach which uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that learns when to explore (widen the search) or exploit (narrow it). 
We demonstrate that the RL approach is capable of answering more queries than the  baseline, while being more efficient, i.e., reading fewer documents.


%Machine reading of large document corpora is expensive.
%{\em Focused reading} incrementally and efficiently searches for information in a document corpus.
%We present a first family of algorithms for focused reading.  
%We develop a reinforcement learning framework for learning better focused reading policies.
%We demonstrate that the reinforcement learning approach finds more information than a strong baseline, while reading fewer documents.
% \todo{Must be much punchier.}
