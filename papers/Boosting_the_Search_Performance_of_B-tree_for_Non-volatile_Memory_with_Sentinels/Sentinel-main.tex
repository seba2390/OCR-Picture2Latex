\begin{abstract}
The next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) is striding into computer systems as a new tier 
as it incorporates both DRAM's byte-addressability and disk's persistency.
Researchers and practitioners have considered building {\em persistent memory} 
by placing NVM on the memory bus for CPU to directly load and store data.
As a result, cache-friendly data structures have been developed for NVM.
One of them is the prevalent B+-tree. State-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees
mainly focus on the optimization of write operations (insertion and deletion).
However, search is of vital importance for B+-tree.
Not only search-intensive workloads benefit from an optimized search, but
insertion and deletion also rely on a preceding search operation to proceed.
In this paper, we attentively study a sorted B+-tree node that spans over
contiguous cache lines. 
Such cache lines
exhibit a monotonically increasing trend and searching a target key across them
can be accelerated by estimating a range the key falls into.
To do so, we construct a probing {\em Sentinel Array} in which a sentinel stands for
each cache line of B+-tree node. Checking the Sentinel Array 
avoids scanning unnecessary cache lines and hence
significantly reduces cache misses for a search.
A quantitative evaluation shows that
using Sentinel Arrays boosts the search performance of state-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees
by up to 48.4\% while the cost of maintaining of Sentinel Array is low.
