\section{Conclusion}
Search is of primary importance for B+-tree. In this paper, we revisited the search operation of in-NVM B+-tree with sorted nodes and found that the search performance is mainly affected by read amplification and cache misses. As a result, we proposed to use a sentinel to stand for each cache line of a sorted node. Before checking the actual array of KV pairs, a search operation first goes through the probing Sentinel Array to determine which cache line the target key would reside in. As the Sentinel Array is much smaller than the actual array of KV pairs, the number of cache misses is significantly reduced. Extensive experiments confirm that using sentinels significantly boosts the search performance of state-of-the-art B+-trees developed for NVM, especially with larger nodes.
