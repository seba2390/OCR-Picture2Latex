\textbf{APPENDIX C: \text{7:2} MEAN MOTION RESONANCE}\\ \label{appendix:resonant_asteroids}

Mean motion resonances (MMRs) with Jupiter are known to influence the orbital evolution of the objects associated with the Taurid Complex. In particular, the 7:2 MMR is responsible for the formation of a resonant branch of meteoroids, that increases the level of activity of the Taurid meteor shower when approaching Earth. The resonant branch may also include large NEAs, of order a few hundred meters to 1 km in size, that are protected from dynamical diffusion by the resonance over long periods of time. 

Since the 7:2 MMR may play an important role on the evolution of the TC members investigated, we determined the proportion of objects in our sample that were likely trapped in the resonance during several millennia. To that end, for each body integrated, we computed the value of the resonant argument $\sigma$ as described in \cite{Asher1991}:  

\begin{equation}
\sigma =  7\lambda_J - 2\lambda - 5\varpi
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_J$ is the mean longitude of Jupiter, and $\lambda$ and $\varpi$ the mean longitude and  longitude of perihelion of the body integrated. If the body evolves inside the resonance, the resonant angle $\sigma$ librates around 0, with an amplitude between 0 and 180$\degree$. If the amplitude of the oscillations is low, the object is strongly trapped into the resonance. The top panel of figure \ref{fig:example_resonant} illustrates the case of a body not evolving into the 7:2 MMR (i.e., comet 2P/Encke), while the bottom panel represents the evolution of an object strongly trapped in the resonance (namely 2005 UY6). 

For each body in our sample, we analyzed the evolution of the resonant argument $\sigma$ for every clone created from the body's nominal orbit. We then determined the percentage of clones trapped into the 7:2 MMR over time. Figure \ref{fig:percent_resonant} presents the percentage of resonant clones of each body integrated over the past and future 20 000 years. For clarity reasons, the objects with the highest percentage of resonant clones are represented in color, while objects with less than 20\% of the clones evolving in the 7:2 MMR most of the time are drawn in grey.

	\label{fig:example_resonant}
\end{figure}

From this figure, we see that NEAs 2005 UY6, 2015 TX24, 2005 TF50, 2019 UN12, 2003 UL3 and 2005 UR have at least 50\% of their clones trapped into the resonance during several thousand of years. In particular, most of the clones of 2005 UY6, 2015 TX24, 2005 TF50 and 2019 UN12 stay in the resonance during the whole integration period. In a lower extent, about 20\% of the clones of 2019 AN12, 2019 RV3 and 2020 JV remained in the resonance during the integration period. The recently observed NEA 2019 BJ1 clearly evolves in the 7:2 MMR at the current epoch, but its number of resonant clones decreases significantly after 5000 years of integration. 

In figure \ref{fig:percent_fireballs}, we present the results of the same analysis applied to the fireballs investigated in Section 5. As expected, all the fireballs except the comparator Southern Taurid EN241015\_185031 evolved in the 7:2 MMR at the epoch of observation in 2015. During the backward integration, the percentage of resonant clones decreases regularly for most of the fireballs, reaching a minimum of about 30\% resonant clones around 10 000 BCE. We therefore conclude that all the fireballs remained inside or close to the 7:2 MMR during the integration period, confirming their membership in the Taurid Swarm Complex.
