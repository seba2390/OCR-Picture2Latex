    The \ESMT problem takes as input a set $\mathcal P$ of points in the Euclidean plane and finds the minimum length network interconnecting all the points of $\mathcal P$. In this paper, in continuation to the works of~\cite{du1987steiner} and ~\cite{weng1995steiner}, we study \ESMT when $\mathcal P$ is formed by the vertices of a pair of regular, concentric and parallel $n$-gons. 
    %Previously, Du, Hwang, and Weng~\cite{du1987steiner} studied the structures of Steiner Minimal Trees of simple regular polygons. Weng and Booth~\cite{weng1995steiner} studied the structures of the Steiner Minimal Trees of regular polygons and their centre. As it is easy to algorithmically compute the Steiner Minimal Tree for a small number of points, our main focus would be on the configurations where the individual polygons have at least $13$ vertices. 
    We restrict our attention to the cases where the two polygons are not very close to each other. In such cases, we show that \ESMT is polynomial-time solvable, and we describe an explicit structure of a Euclidean Steiner minimal tree for $\mathcal P$.
    %We finally show that there is a Steiner Minimal Tree of a pair of concentric, parallel, regular $n$-gons following a particular kind of topology under the aforementioned setting. 
    %Although it is known that the Euclidean Steiner Minimal tree problem does not admit fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS) for general point settings, there exists a FPTAS for convex point sets. We analyze where the problem stops giving a FPTAS in the transition from a convex point set to any arbitrary point set. This transition can be characterized using the number of points inside the convex hull of the point set as a parameter. 
    
    We also consider point sets $\mathcal P$ of size $n$ where the number of input points not on the convex hull of $\mathcal P$ is $f(n) \leq n$. We give an exact algorithm with running time $2^{\OO(f(n)\log n)}$ for such input point sets $\mathcal P$. Note that when $f(n) = \OO(\frac{n}{\log n})$, our algorithm runs in single-exponential time, and when $f(n) = o(n)$ the running time is $2^{o(n\log n)}$ which is better than the known algorithm in~\cite{hwang1992steiner}. 
    
    We know that no FPTAS exists for \ESMT unless \pnp~\cite{garey1977complexity}. On the other hand FPTASes exist for \ESMT on convex point sets~\cite{scott1988convexity}. In this paper, we show that if the number of input points in $\mathcal P$ not belonging to the convex hull of $\mathcal P$ is $\OO(\log n)$, then an FPTAS exists for \ESMT. In contrast, we show that for any $\epsilon \in (0,1]$, when there are $\Omega(n^{\epsilon})$ points not belonging to the convex hull of the input set, then no FPTAS can exist for \ESMT unless \pnp. 
    %Our final result includes an FPTAS for $\OO(\log n)$ points inside the convex hull and ruling out the existence of any FPTAS when the number of points inside the convex hull is $\Omega(n^\epsilon)$ for all $\epsilon \in (0,1)$.
