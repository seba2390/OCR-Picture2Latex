\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose Flow-Packet Hybrid Traffic Classification (FPHTC), which enables low-complexity but highly accurate packet-based classification at a network router. In FPHTC, a sophisticated flow-based classifier
residing outside the router uses high-dimensional flow-level features to achieve high classification accuracy, while a routing policy designer generates a simple routing policy for the router based on a small number of packet-level features, utilizing the knowledge of the flow-based classifier. We discuss routing policy updates in an online setting, which keeps FPHTC robust towards traffic pattern change over time. Our experimental results confirms that the learned knowledge from the flow-based classifier can substantially improve the performance of the routing policy.
