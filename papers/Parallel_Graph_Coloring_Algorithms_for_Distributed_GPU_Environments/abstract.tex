Graph coloring is often used in parallelizing scientific computations that run in distributed and multi-GPU environments; it identifies sets of independent data that can be updated in parallel. 
Many algorithms exist for graph coloring on a single GPU or in distributed memory, but to the best of our knowledge, hybrid MPI+GPU algorithms have been unexplored until this work.
We present several MPI+GPU coloring approaches based on the distributed coloring algorithms of 
Gebremedhin et al. %~\cite{IAB:bozdaug2008framework}
%\todo{not sure about citations in abstracts -- I always avoid them to keep the abstract standalone, but maybe Karen/Erik have differing opinions} 
%KDD I usual err on the side of over-citing, but I'm OK with this style
and the shared-memory algorithms of 
Deveci et al. %~\cite{IAB:deveci2016parallel}.
The on-node parallel coloring uses implementations in 
KokkosKernels, %~\cite{IAB:edwards2014kokkos} 
 which provide parallelization for both multicore CPUs and GPUs.
We further extend our approaches to compute distance-2 and partial distance-2
colorings, giving the first known distributed, multi-GPU algorithm for these problems.
In addition, we propose a novel heuristic to reduce communication for recoloring in distributed graph coloring. 
Our experiments show that our approaches operate efficiently on inputs too large to fit on a single GPU and scale up to graphs with 76.7 billion edges running on 128 GPUs.
%We observe that our implementations give average speedups of 3.79x for distance-1 coloring and 9x for Distance-2 coloring on 128 GPUs relative to a single GPU.
%\todo{KDD: this last result is doesn't sound great, and explaining why it is good is more nuanced than we can explain in an abstract; I propose we skip the last sentence in the abstract.}
