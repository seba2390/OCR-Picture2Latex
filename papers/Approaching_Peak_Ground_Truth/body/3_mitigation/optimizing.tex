\subsection{Optimizing Metric Choice}
\label{sec:metric_selection}
Apart from annotation inaccuracies, \eac{PGT} significantly depends on the metrics' ability to capture \eac{RWMP}.
Maier-Hein, Reinke, and others \citep{reinke2021common, maier2022metrics, reinke2022metrics, REINKE2021710} provide guidelines for tailoring the metric selection around the underlying \emph{real-world} problem.
% According to Kelly is also crucial for a successful translation of \eac{ML} models into clinical practice. \citep{Kelly2019}.
In the absence of situation-specific similarity metrics, a popular mitigation strategy represents optimizing multiple metrics at the same time.
Challenge organizers also frequently adopt this strategy \citep{maier2018rankings}.
Similarly, for the training of semantic segmentation models, compound loss functions, such as combining soft Dice loss with binary cross-entropy loss,  have become increasingly popular \citep{isensee2021nnu,kofler2021we}.
