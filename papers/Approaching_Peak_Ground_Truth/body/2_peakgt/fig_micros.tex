Dependency on thresholding in light sheet fluorescence microscopy -- slices depicting human neurons from the public \emph{SHANEL} dataset \citep{zhao2020cellular} at different thresholds.
\emph{Left}: the neurons at a low threshold.
\emph{Middle}: the neurons at a medium threshold overlayed with the annotation of the expert neurobiologist.
Colors represent the instances (neurons).
\emph{Right}: the neurons at a high threshold.
Depending on the arbitrary intensity threshold setting, the objects appear in varying sizes.
This effect is particularly pronounced in light sheet microscopy, as the illumination is perpendicular to the objective.
Consequently, the annotations can appear on the full spectrum from \emph{over-} to \emph{under-segmented}.
Notably, only one of the neurons encircled in \emph{magenta} and \emph{lime} is annotated, while neither appears in the \emph{left} image.
This illustrates the subjectivity of human-curated \emph{labels} and thus the discrepancy between \emph{annotations} and \emph{ground truth}.
