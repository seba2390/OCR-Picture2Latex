\section{Peak Ground Truth}
\label{sec:peakgt}
The term \eacf{PGT} is inspired by \emph{Peak Oil} \cite{hubbert1949energy}.
In this section, we explain the theoretical foundation of \eac{PGT}, propose means to quantitatively approximate it, and demonstrate its relevance across various \eac{ML} data sets.
