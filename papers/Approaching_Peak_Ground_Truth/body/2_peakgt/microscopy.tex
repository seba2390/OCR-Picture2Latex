These are particularly pronounced in light microscopy.
In fluorescence microscopy, objects appear smaller or larger in size depending on the setting of the threshold intensity; cf. \Cref{fig:micros}.
Consequently, the volumes of the resulting annotations are a function of the threshold setting.
Furthermore, thresholding stands in complex interaction with biological parameters, such as the quality of the applied clearing, the tissue's autofluorescence, or fluorophore amplification \citep{cai2019panoptic}.


It is important to note that comparable issues arise for other imaging techniques.
For instance, \emph{Magnetic Resonance} or \emph{Computed Tomography} images frequently suffer from artifacts induced due to motion, field inhomogeneity, etc.
This should be taken into account when interpreting volumetric measures, such as the popular \eac{DSC}.
