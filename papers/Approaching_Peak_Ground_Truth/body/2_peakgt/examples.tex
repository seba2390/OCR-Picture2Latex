\subsection{Practical examples}
Annotation inaccuracies are common in \eac{ML} data sets, such as \emph{COCO, ImageNet, RTE-1, BraTS} or \emph{ChestX-ray8} \citep{Ma_2022_CVPR,Yun_2021_CVPR,pmlr-v119-shankar20c,beyer2020we,klebanov2010some,kofler2021we,wang2017chestx}.
Bio-medical imaging techniques often contain modality-specific artifacts overshadowing the annotation process.
