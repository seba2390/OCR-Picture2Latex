Maier-Hein et al.\ \citep{maier2018rankings} revealed that challenge rankings heavily depend on the choice of evaluation metrics.
Further, Kofler et al.\ \citep{kofler2021we} found that established similarity metrics only moderately correlate with expert perception regarding glioma segmentation of BraTS algorithms.
Similarly, Reinke et al.\ \citep{reinke2021common} illustrate limitations of image processing metrics.
Taha et al.\ \citep{taha2015metrics} analyze the properties of 20 segmentation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting the most appropriate ones for a given task.
Building upon that, Radsch et al.\ \citep{radsch2022labeling} point out that the labeling instructions also matter.
Continuing this trend, in 2020, the \href{http://www.https://qubiq.grand-challenge.org}{QUBIQ Challenge} was hosted for the first time providing participants with multiple reference annotations to reflect variance in the labeling process.
