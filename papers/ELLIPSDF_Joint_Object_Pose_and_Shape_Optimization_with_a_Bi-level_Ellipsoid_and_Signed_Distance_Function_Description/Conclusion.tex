\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work proposes ELLIPSDF, which a novel semantic mapping approach for RGB-D sensors using a compact, shared latent representation for a bi-level object model to achieve joint pose and shape optimizaiton. Evaluation results on large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELLIPSDF compared with other approaches.  
A future research direction is to integrate ELLIPSDF into the pose graph optimization for key-frame based SLAM.
