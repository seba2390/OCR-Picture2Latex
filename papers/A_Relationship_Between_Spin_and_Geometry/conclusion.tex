\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we demonstrated the incompatibility of the Clifford algebra with arbitrary non-relativistic spin structures, and defined a family of generalised Clifford-like algebras which support arbitrary spin structures. To do this, we presented a novel algebraic derivation for the structure of the Lie algebra $\sopq$, without the need to appeal to the theory of differential geometry or Lie groups. We also defined an even more general Clifford-like algebra with no spin structure at all, which underpins the structure of the arbitrary spin Clifford-like algebras. In so doing, we explicated the geometric structure of the spin algebras, and showed that they each define a unique non-commutative geometry on Euclidean three-space. We found that this structure induces a spin-dependence on the measured notions of area and volume, and compared these new arbitrary spin algebras with existing models of arbitrary spin. Some applications and avenues for further enquiry were discussed.
