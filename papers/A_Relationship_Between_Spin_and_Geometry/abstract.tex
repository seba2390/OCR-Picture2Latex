    In a recent paper, algebraic descriptions for all non-relativistic spins were derived by elementary means directly from the Lie algebra $\specialorthogonalliealgebra{3}$, and a connection between spin and the geometry of Euclidean three-space was drawn. However, the details of this relationship and the extent to which it can be developed by elementary means were not expounded. In this paper, we will reveal the geometric content of the spin algebras by realising them within a novel, generalised form of Clifford-like algebra. In so doing, we will demonstrate a natural connection between spin and non-commutative geometry, and discuss the impact of this on the measurement of hypervolumes and on quantum mechanics.
