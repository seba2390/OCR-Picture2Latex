\section{Notation}

\noindent
Let $P = \{p_1, \ldots, p_m\}$ be a set of processors defining the
current state of the system. Processor $p_1$ is the \emph{head}, Processor
$p_m$ is the \emph{tail}.  We say that $p_i < p_j$ iff $p_i$ is upstream
from (closer to the head than) $p_j$.  We note that during some advanced
operations of the system, processors can change order within the ring.  
However, our notation is intended to help analyze instantaneous states 
of the system, so after alterations to the ring of processors, we will 
always refer to the head as $p_1$, the tail as $p_m$, and the $i$th
processor is $p_i$.


We now define some notation to describe the instantaneous state of the 
Graph $G$ stored by the system.
The current vertex set is defined as $V(G) = \{v_1, \ldots, v_n\}$.
Let $B_v$ be the set of \emph{primitive building blocks} 
$B_v = {b_i : i \le n}$, where $b_i \in B_v$ is another name for $v_i$.  We
also define a set $B  = B_v \cup \{b_i : i > n\}$ representing the 
name space for building blocks and local components in the system.

Let $V(b_i) \subseteq V(G)$ be the set of graph vertices 
encapsulated by building block $b_i$, and
let $\prec$ be a relation defined such that $b_i \prec b_j$ 
iff $V(b_i) \subset V(b_j)$.  Thus:
\[ V(b_j) = \cup_{b_i \prec b_j} V(b_i). \]

Building block $b_i$ is created by and resides in exactly one processor,
which we call $\alpha(b_i)$. By convention, $\alpha(b_i) = \infty$ if
$b_i$ does not exist in the system.  We now define a \emph{relabing function}
$R_j : B_v \rightarrow B$ which returns the name of the local component in
Processor $p_j$ that encapsulates a primitive building block $b_v$:

\begin{equation}
R_j(b_v) = \begin{cases}
         b_v & \text{if $p_j < \alpha(b_v)$} \\
         b_i & \text{if $b_v \prec b_i$ and $\alpha(b_v) = p_j$} \\
         R_{j-1}(b_v) & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
