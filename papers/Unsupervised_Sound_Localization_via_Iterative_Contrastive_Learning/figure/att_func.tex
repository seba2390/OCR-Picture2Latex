     \caption{\textbf{Learning co-attention of audio-visual features as a cue for binaural audio prediction.} For each audio component (out of $u \times t$) in the spectorgram, we perform correlation between it and the observe visual feature, which identifies the corresponding spatial region(s) of interest. With left and right weighting functions applied, the left-right audio-visual relationship can be derived and guide the learning of left-right audio difference in our framework.}
