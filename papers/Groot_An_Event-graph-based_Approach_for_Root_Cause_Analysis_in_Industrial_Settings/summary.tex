\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented our work around root cause analysis (RCA) in industrial settings. To tackle three major RCA challenges (complexities of operation, system scale, and monitoring), we have proposed a novel event-graph-based approach named  \system that constructs a real-time causality graph for allowing adaptive customization. 
%instead of a traditional dependency graph between applications, and allows adaptive customizations. 
%We have implemented our approach as an RCA tool named \system. 
\system can handle diversified anomalies and activities from the system under analysis and is extensible to different approaches of anomaly detection or RCA. We have integrated \system into eBay's large-scale distributed system  containing more than \textbf{5,000} microservices. Our evaluation of \system on a data set consisting of 952 real production incidents shows that \system achieves high accuracy and efficiency across different scenarios and also largely outperforms  baseline graph-based approaches. We also share the lessons learned from deploying and adopting \system in production environments.
