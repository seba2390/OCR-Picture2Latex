\begin{abstract}

For large-scale distributed systems, it is crucial to efficiently diagnose the root causes of incidents to maintain high system availability. The recent development of microservice architecture brings three major challenges (i.e., complexities of operation, system scale, and monitoring) to root cause analysis (RCA) in industrial settings. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we present \system, an event-graph-based approach for RCA. \system constructs a real-time causality graph based on events that summarize various types of metrics, logs, and activities in the system under analysis. Moreover, to incorporate domain knowledge from site reliability engineering (SRE) engineers, \system can be customized with user-defined events and domain-specific rules. Currently, \system supports RCA among \textit{5,000} real production services and is actively used by the SRE teams in eBay, a global e-commerce system serving more than \textit{159 million} active buyers per year. Over 15 months, we collect a data set containing labeled root causes of 952 real production incidents for evaluation. The evaluation results show that \system is able to achieve 95\% top-3 accuracy and 78\% top-1 accuracy. To share our experience in deploying and adopting RCA in industrial settings, we conduct a survey to show that users of \system find it helpful and easy to use. We also share the lessons learned from deploying and adopting \system to solve RCA problems in production environments.

% Groot firstly construct application run-time application dependency graph; then connects "events" such as developer activities, and distributed low-level monitoring events generated by real-time anomaly detection models; and do root cause analysis at the event level on a dynamic event graph.
