Dear Editors,
\vspace{12pt}

Included is our manuscript entitled \textbf{Evoking empathy with visually impaired people through an augmented reality embodiment experience}, authored by Renan Guarese, Emma Jane Pretty, Dr. Haytham Fayek, Dr. Ron van Schyndel and Prof. Fabio Zambetta, for your consideration for publication at IEEE VR 2023.
\vspace{1pt}

In this experimental paper, we propose a multi-sensory Augmented Reality (AR) experience that allows sighted users to embody having a visual impairment whilst using assistive technologies. We survey both sighted, and blind and visually impaired (BVI) participants on sighted people's empathy towards the BVI community and explore the differences. A subset of the sighted participants also participated in the aforementioned embodiment of difference experience using AR, to which their empathy was measured again. This work demonstrates the need for empathy-evoking experiences to reduce stigma, and encourage the development of assistive technologies to further support the BVI community.

We believe that this work lies within the scope of IEEE VR 2023 and is of high interest to its attendees and subsequent readers.
\vspace{12pt}

We would like to advise that this manuscript has not been published or accepted for publication, nor is it under editorial review elsewhere; it is the result of our original work. All authors have accepted the contents of the manuscript and its submission to the venue. Excluding references and appendices, the main body of text is approximately 6 double-columned pages long.
\vspace{12pt}

We look forward to your favourable consideration.
\vspace{12pt}

Thank you.
