\section{Introducing SEPSIS: A novel corpus on \ul{lies of omission}}
\label{sec:introduction}
\vspace{-1.5mm}
We are delighted to introduce the \textbf{SEPSIS} corpus (\textbf{S}p\textbf{E}culation o\textbf{P}inion bia\textbf{S} d\textbf{I}\textbf{S}tortion), explicitly curated for \emph{lies of omission}. This novel resource will significantly enhance the study and analysis of deceptive communication by focusing on the deliberate exclusion of information. Figure \ref{fig:sepsis} offers a concise visual depiction that effectively summarizes the categorization we present in the SEPSIS. 
%We take great pride in presenting the SEPSIS corpus (SpEculation oPinion biaS dIStortion), a pioneering corpus specifically dedicated to lies of omission. This novel resource will enrich the study and analysis of deceptive communication by honing in on the deliberate omission of information.
%Figure ~\ref{fig:sepsis} provides a visual representation that succinctly summarizes the innovative categorization we have developed for the creation of SEPSIS. This novel categorization scheme plays a crucial role in organizing and classifying the corpus, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the lies of omission. 
%In the subsequent paragraphs, we outline scientific questions that serve as motivations for our research. We elucidate how the pursuit of these questions has influenced the development of our annotation schema, which plays a fundamental role in the design of our research framework.
In the subsequent paragraphs, we present a collection of scientific inquiries along with their corresponding answers, which serve as the driving force behind our research. Furthermore, we delve into the influence of these questions on the development of our annotation schema, which lays the groundwork for our research framework.

 %\ac{citations needed} 
there exist 42 well-defined dialogue acts. Following extensive deliberation and analysis, we have reached the conclusion that individuals often utilize dialogue acts such as \emph{speculation, opinion, bias, and distortions} when engaging in deceptive behavior. 
%Through rigorous discussion and debate, we derived a conclusion that dialogue acts commonly employed by individuals when they engage in deceptive behavior are \emph{speculation, opinion, bias, and distortions}. 
%These acts serve as figurative dialogue acts utilized by individuals to conceal their lies through encryption \cite{elaad2003effects} while they want to drop some information.
These dialogue acts function as figurative communication techniques employed by individuals to mask their deceit through encryption \cite{elaad2003effects}, particularly when they desire to disclose certain information selectively.}

\textbf{\ul{What has been omitted?}} In the study of lies of omission, it is crucial to determine what information has been deliberately omitted. To address this, we draw inspiration from journalism, where the use of the 5W framework is common. The 5W framework consists of the questions \textit{who, what, when, where, and why} which are considered fundamental in information gathering and problem-solving. These questions are frequently utilized in journalism and police investigations \cite{10.2307/1023893, stofer2009sports, silverman, su2019study, smarts_2017,article_2023}. As an example:

\textbf{\ul{What is the vulnerability of the uttered lie?}} In the realm of deception research, it is of utmost importance to comprehend and quantify the susceptibility of lies. One approach involves categorizing lies into different colors, namely \emph{black, red, white, and gray} \cite{ratliff2011behavioral,depaulo2004many}. Each color represents a distinct type of lie with varying levels of vulnerability, as detailed below:

\section{SEPSIS: Data Sources, Annotation, and Agreement}
\vspace{-1mm}  
At the outset, we engaged in the crowd annotation of 5,000 sentences through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), employing four layers of deception. Subsequently, we applied data augmentation techniques as detailed in section ~\ref{sec:data_augmentation}, culminating in a total of 8,76,784 data points.

\subsection{Data Sources}
\vspace{-0.5mm}  

\input{table/kappa_score_3d}
In terms of data sources, we have identified two distinct categories of interest. The first category focuses on the presence of omissions in factual data, specifically news data. The second category examines the involvement of omissions in fake news data. To address these categories, we have selected data sources from two prominent outlets: (a) Times of India \cite{timesofindia} Twitter handle, the renowned news agency in India, and (b) Information Security and Object Technology (ISOT) fake news dataset \cite{ISOTFakeNewsDataset}. More information on these sources can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:data sources}. A detailed analysis of the SEPSIS corpus and the results can be found in Appendix \ref{sec: data analysis}.
%Data acquisition is done primarily from two sources Times of India \cite{} which is a popular Indian media house and a popular fake news data set. \cite{}. It is a compilation of several thousand fake news and truthful articles, obtained from different legitimate news sites and sites flagged as unreliable by \emph{"Politifact.com"}. From this dataset a sample of 2605 datapoint is taken from the one that is flagged as fake news.

\subsection{Data Annotation}
\vspace{-1mm}  
% For annotation we chose to utilize the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service. This platform offers a quick and cost-effective solution for annotating large-scale datasets, although it is important to acknowledge its susceptibility to errors.
We have chosen to leverage the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service for annotation purposes, which provides a rapid and cost-effective solution for annotating large-scale datasets, albeit acknowledging its susceptibility to errors. To ensure the annotation quality, we implemented rigorous checks and measures throughout the entire annotation process. The dataset was annotated at the sentence level using a multi-class annotation approach, allowing each individual feature to be assigned multiple categories during the annotation process. For instance, a statement could be tagged as both speculative and sounding factual, recognizing the possibility for it to either be a verifiable fact or contain speculative elements that satisfy both possibilities. A comprehensive account of the overall annotation process is provided in Appendix \ref{sec: data cleaning}. Notably, during the initial layer of annotation, if a particular text appeared to be factual, we refrained from annotating the specific type, intent, and influence of the lie since it was treated as a fact.

\subsection{Inter Annotator Agreement and Quality}
\label{sec:iaa_score}
To ensure quality control in the AMT annotations, we performed in-house annotation on 1000 data points. This in-house dataset was utilized to assess the quality of annotations provided by individual annotators. Based on this assessment, we selected the appropriate set of annotators on the AMT platform. For the annotation task on AMT, we offered a compensation of \$1 for each sentence annotation across all the four layers.

We obtained four annotations per sentence and subsequently consolidated the data using an improved voting technique, as suggested in \cite{hovy-etal-2013-learning}, which has been empirically shown to outperform majority voting. To assess the level of agreement in the annotated corpus, we also calculated the Cohen Kappa score \cite{cohen1960coefficient}. Since there are multiple categories for a given sentence, we report class-wise agreement scores. The overall agreement score is presented in Table \ref{tab: Kappa score}. An overview of data points is presented in Table \ref{tab:SEPSIS_corpus}. To understand how features across these four layers are dependent on each other we present six heatmaps in Appendix \ref{sec: data analysis}.



%The comprehensive examination of various categories of lies reveals a complex and nuanced understanding, posing challenges in the annotation process. Consequently, the Lies of Omission category received relatively lower scores. Conversely, the intent of lie and color of lies categories proved comparatively more accessible for comprehension, interpretation, and detection, leading to higher scores in this layer. Taking into account the inherently subjective nature of the matter at hand, we deem our inter-annotation scores to be fairly commendable.

%\textcolor{red}{we need some text to describe what to take away from agreement scores.} \textcolor{green}{Is this okay?}

\begin{comment}
We addressed several issues in our dataset to improve the reliability of the annotations and reduce redundancies. Many data points were assigned the correct reason behind their choice but were assigned the wrong category. For example, certain statements were placed under the 'distortion' category, but the provided reason suggested their categorization to be 'speculation.' Additionally, we re-annotated several incomplete entries where annotators had entered the statement category but missed providing further information on the color of lies or intent of lies.
