In this work, we propose the notion of \textit{model re-engineering}, which re-engineers a trained DNN model to improve its reusability.
Based on the notion, we propose a search-based model re-engineering approach named \projectName, which can re-engineer a trained model by removing many irrelevant weights.
Extensive experiments with four representative CNN models on eight widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \projectName in reusing trained models as well as reducing reuse overhead and defect inheritance.
