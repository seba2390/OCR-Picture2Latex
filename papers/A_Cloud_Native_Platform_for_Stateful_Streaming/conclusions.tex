\section{Conclusion}

Cloud native Streams replaces the IBM Streams platform with Kubernetes. It
offloads life cycle management, scheduling, networking and fault tolerance to
Kubernetes. It does this by using Kubernetes as a state-management-service: all
important state is managed by Kubernetes, and its services react to state change
events delivered by Kubernetes. Those services implement the cloud native
patterns presented here: controllers, conductors, coordinators and the causal
chains formed by their interactions.  Other workloads can use these patterns to
implement their own cloud native platforms. We have also experimentally
demonstrated areas in which Kubernetes needs improvement to better serve as a
generic platform: performance in an oversubscribed cluster, networking latency,
garbage collector performance and pod recovery latency.
