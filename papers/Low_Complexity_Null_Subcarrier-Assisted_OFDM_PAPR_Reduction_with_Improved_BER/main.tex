In this letter, we propose a low complex data-null subcarrier switching-based peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, which provides improved bit error rate. We perform the switching between the data and null subcarriers in such a way that distance between any two switched-null subcarriers remains constant. This method can achieve up to 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain and shed the system complexity by more than 98\% of the conventional systems, with a slight compromise of the PAPR reduction capability.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{rthogonal} frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been seen as a robust signal processing technique due to its high spectral-efficiency and immunity to intersymbol interference in multi-path fading.  Inspired by these advantages, a number of wireless system standards, such as IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.22 and so on, have adopted OFDM as their physical layer (PHY) technology. Its inclusion in the forthcoming fifth generation (5G) wireless system, however, faces great challenges from the other candidate PHY technologies due to its low energy efficiency caused by high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High PAPR occurs when several sinusoids get added coherently in inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) at a particular instant. The resulting peaks which exceed the operating region of a power amplifier (PA) cause nonlinear distortion at the output of the PA. This nonlinearity causes bit error rate (BER) degradation in-band and out-of-band (OOB) interferences.

There are a plethora of solutions~\cite{IEEEhowto:rahmat}, which have been proposed to solve the longstanding problem. Most of the solutions are spectrally-inefficient because a certain portion of available bandwidth is allocated for this purpose, thereby reducing system throughput. Very few works have been done to date to devise PAPR reduction scheme without compromising spectral-efficiency. Among those, the recently proposed null subcarrier-assisted PAPR reduction scheme~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1} has drawn a considerable attention of the researchers. In such schemes, some of the null subcarriers are used as a tool to reduce PAPR; the positions of certain number of null-subcarriers are switched with all data subcarriers iteratively and the combination that provides the lowest PAPR is transmitted. Instead of sending any side information (SI) to let the receiver know the locations of the switched null-subcarriers, a blind null-detection is carried out at the receiver based on the zero-energy property of the null subcarriers. This technique reduces PAPR significantly, requires no SI, and causes no loss of orthogonality like the well-known clipping technique. However, it suffers from its extremely high computational complexity and poor BER at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to inaccurate switched-null detection accuracy. To reduce its prohibitively high computational overhead, few works are done~\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir1} -\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir3}. All these methods can shed a significant part of overall complexity. The resulting remaining complexity is, however, still very high compared to the other existing PAPR reduction techniques. To reduce the complexity, the authors of the original method~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1} propose a technique in~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong2}, where the main attractive feature of null subcarrier-assited technique~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong2}, no SI requirement, is sacrificed. Such an attempt makes this technique unattractive because the other existing SI-required techniques can reduce more PAPR with much lower computational complexity. In addition to the high computational complexity, the poor switched-null detection of the blind method escalates BER. To the best of our knowledge, no work has yet been done to address this problem. 

In this letter, our goal is to find an efficient switching technique, which will reduce the system complexity in one hand and improve BER on the other hand. In this endeavour, we propose a new low-complex null subcarrier-assisted PAPR reduction scheme which improves BER dramatically.  We propose to switch the positions of the data and null subcarriers in such a way that distance between any two consecutive switched-null subcarriers can be kept constant. This sheds more than 98\% computational burden of the original method~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1}. At the receiver, we use this property in addition to the conventional zero-energy property of null subcarriers for efficient detection of switched-null subcarriers. This increases detection accuracy rate, thereby improving the BER performance.

This letter is organized as follows. Describing the conventional null subcarrier-assisted PAPR reduction scheme in Section II, the proposed scheme is given in Section III. Section IV provides an evaluation of the proposed method and a comparison with the existing schemes. A conclusion is drawn in Section V. 

\section{Conventional Null subcarrier based PAPR Reduction}


In wireless system standards like WiMax (IEEE 802.16) and wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11), a small percentage of the available subcarriers are placed at the center and both sides of data subcarriers. Such subcarriers are called null subcarriers. They carry no information and are employed to form spectrum and reduce OOB radiation. In the implementation of OFDM, they are allocated zero-energy (that is, zero is assigned to the null subcarriers instead of unity energy of phase shift keying (PSK) for example) in the frequency domain. At the receiver, the frequency domain null subcarriers are separated depending on their known locations. 

According to \cite{IEEEhowto:Li}, it is tolerable to use some of the null subcarriers for other purposes. Inspired by this, a null subcarrier-assisted PAPR reduction scheme is proposed in~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1}. To show how this technique works, let us consider two sets: $D$ of length $N_d$ and $G$ of length $N_g$, which consist of indices of the data and null subcarriers, respectively, and $N=N_d+N_g$; the indices are in an ascending order. If the inner-most $P$, which is an even integer, out of $N_g$ null-subcarriers are selected for switching with $P$ unknown data subcarriers, the set $G_s=\{g_{s1},g_{s2},...,g_{sP}\}$   contains the indices of the $P$ pre-selected null-subcarriers. The $P$ out of $N_d$ data subcarriers for interchanging positions with the $P$ pre-selected null subcarriers can be selected in $N_d \choose P$ $=\frac{N_d!}{P!(N_d-P)!}$ different ways. Suppose that the set $D_s=\{d_{s1},d_{s2},...,d_{sp}\}$    contains the indices of the $P$ data subcarriers selected to be switched in an ascending order. Switching between the data and pre-selected null subcarriers is done in $N_d \choose P$ times and PAPR of each data and null subcarrier combination is computed; the combination which provides the lowest PAPR is selected for transmission.  The switching between the data and null subcarriers is done in such a way that if    $d_{sm}<d_{s(m+1)}$, then $g_{sm}<g_{s(m+1)}$, we will call this constraint as switching constraint in the rest of this paper. Using this switching constraint and zero-energy property of the null subcarriers, the de-switching is performed at the receiver without any kind of SI. 

\section{Proposed Scheme}
In this letter, we propose a null subcarrier based new blind PAPR reduction scheme to improve BER and computational complexity of the method proposed in [1]. Instead of swapping the positions of randomly-selected data subcarriers with the pre-selected set of null subcarriers, we plan to interchange the positions of these two kinds of subcarriers in a predetermined manner so that an equidistance property can be maintained, where the equidistance property is a characteristic of having a constant distance between any two consecutive switched-null subcarriers. This constant distance is defined by $R=\frac{N_d}{P}$. Usually, $\frac{N_g}{2}$  and $\frac{N_g}{2}-1$ out of $N_g$ null subcarriers are placed to the left and right of the data sequence, respectively, and the rest one is placed at the center of it. Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1} shows the subcarrier arrangement and switching procedure between the data and null subcarriers, where the double arrows indicate the data and null subcarriers between which switching will be done in this phase of switching. The conventional arrangement of subcarriers is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}(a) for $P=2$. The inner-most $P$ (with $\frac{P}{2}$ from each side) null subcarriers are selected for switching. The first phase of switching is done using the following rule: for any positive integer  $K\leq \frac{P}{2}$ , the $N-N_d-\frac{N_g}{2}-(\frac{P}{2}-K)$–th subcarsubrier is switched with the $\frac{N_g}{2}+\frac{(K-1)N_d}{P}+1$-th subcarrier, and when $K>\frac{P}{2}$, the switching is done between the $N-(\frac{N_g}{2}-1)+(K-\frac{P}{2})$-th and $\frac{N_g}{2}+\frac{(K-1)N_d}{P}+2$-th subcarriers. In the second phase of switching (see Fig.~~\ref{fig:fig1}(b)), each switched-null subcarrier swaps its position with the data subcarrier located just to right. The resulting combination of the data and null subcarriers is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}(c); in this phase, the switching is done following the rule used in the second phase, that is, the switched-null subcarrier with an index $m$ interchanges its position with the data subcarrier having the index $m+1$. This process of switching continues until the index of the last switched-null subcarrier is less than $N-\frac{N_g}{2}-1$ or the allowable maximum iteration is met. PAPR of the time-domain version of each of these combinations is computed, and the combination which provides the lowest PAPR is selected for transmission.

\end{figure}


   We shall now discuss the null detection technique. All conventional blind data-null subcarrier switching based systems~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1,IEEEhowto:sabbir1,IEEEhowto:sabbir2,IEEEhowto:sabbir3,IEEEhowto:wong2} use the same null detection technique, which can be described as follows. As mentioned before, zero is assigned to null subcarriers in the frequency domain by the transmitter~\cite{IEEEhowto:Li}. At the receiver, the null detection is carried out in the frequency-domain signal.  In case of a noise free channel, the subcarriers which have zero energy are identified as the switched-null subcarriers. Since noise free channels are not available in practice, all subcarriers have some energy. Thus, the switched-null subcarriers possess noise power. For this reason, the $P$ subcarriers out of $D$ set carrying the $P$ lowest power are considered as the switched-null subcarriers. Upon detection, the de-switching is done with the switched-data subcarriers using the switching constraint (i.e., if $d_{sm}<d_{s(m+1)}$, then $g_{sm}<g_{s(m+1)}$). The detection accuracy is, however, very low, which results in extremely poor BER.
   
   
   To improve the detection accuracy, we will use the equidistance property in addition to the zero-energy property. The received time-domain signal is first converted to its corresponding frequency-domain version applying fast Fourier transform (FFT). The proposed switched-null subcarriers detection method is applied on this signal. Since all the switched-null subcarriers are placed in the data subcarriers maintaining a predefined distance from each other, firstly all possible sets of switched-null subcarriers' indices are generated. Let us consider a matrix $S$ of dimension $R\times P$, where each element of $S$ is defined in the following way:
 \begin{equation*}\label{eq.1}
  S_{i,j}=
  \begin{cases}
  u_i+nR & \text{for  $0<n<\frac{P}{2}$}\\
  u_i+nR+1 & \text{for $P/2\leq n \leq P$}
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
 where $U=[u_1\;u_2\;u_3\;.\;.\;.\;u_R]^T=[\frac{N_g}{2}+1\;\frac{N_g}{2}+2\;\frac{N_g}{2}+3\;.\;.\;.\;\frac{N_g}{2}+R]^T$, and $n$ is an integer ranging from 0 to $P-1$. Each row of $S$ represents a candidate set for indices of the switched-null subcarriers. For each candidate set (i.e., each row of $S$), the total power of the subcarriers whose indices are contained in that specific row of $S_i$ is computed. The candidate set which provides the lowest total power among these $R$ sets of candidates is selected as the set of indices of the true switched-null subcarriers. Then the de-switching between the switched-null and data subcarriers is done in the usual manner using the switching constraint.

\section{Performance Evaluation}
Performance of the proposed system will be analysed in terms of PAPR reduction capability, computational complexity and BER. While the computational complexity will be evaluated analytically, the rest two will be evaluated through simulations. The simulation parameters are as follows: 52 data subcarriers out of 64 total subcarriers like \cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir3}, 12 null-subcarriers, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation, and four times oversampling. Every simulation result is taken sending $10^4$ OFDM symbols.

   A comparison of complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of PAPRs of the proposed system to that of the conventional null subcarrier-based PAPR reduction system~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1} and the original OFDM is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}. It is clear that the PAPR reduction capability of the proposed system is very close to that of the conventional one; while PAPR of less than 0.1\% of the transmitted symbols of the original OFDM exceeds 10.37 dB, the PAPR for the conventional and proposed systems are 9.11 dB and 9.23 dB, respectively, at the same CCDF level; that is, the proposed system degrades 9.5\% of the PAPR reduction capability of the conventional null subcarrier-based PAPR reduction scheme. At CCDF level of $10^{-2}$, this degradation goes down to 7.7\%.

   The BER of a null subcarrier-assisted blind PAPR reduction system largely depends on the switched-null subcarriers detection accuracy at the receiver. Every wrong detection results in wrong de-switching between the switched-data and null subcarriers, which ends up BER degradation. The switched-null subcarrier detection comparison between the conventional null subcarrier assisted PAPR reduction scheme and proposed one over additive white Gaussian noise channel in different SNR cases is given in Table 1. As is seen, the proposed system far outperforms the conventional one in detecting switched null subcarriers. For instance, the accuracies of the conventional systems are 0.7\% and 0\% for $P=$2 and 4, respectively, at 0 dB SNR. In contrast, the corresponding detection accuracies of the proposed system are about 20\% and 51\%. While the detection accuracy of the conventional system degrades with the increase of the switched-null subcarriers, a reverse relation is observed for the proposed system; an outstanding improvement is found with larger number of switched-null subcarriers.
   
   The effect of the pilot detection accuracy on the BER is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig3}. To reveal how much BER degradation the blind PAPR reduction system itself is responsible for, no PA is included in the transmitter. Fig.~\ref{fig3} reveals that the improvement in switched-null subcarriers detection causes better BER. For $P=4$ and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation, while a target BER of $10^{-3}$ can be achieved by the conventional systems at 11.85 dB SNR (which is about 6 dB higher than that of the original OFDM), the proposed one can reach the target with 6.1 dB (only 0.2 dB higher than that of the original OFDM). For QPSK modulation, the proposed system does not cause SNR loss to achieve the target BER for any value of $P$. The conventional systems, however, require 1.3 and 1.7 dB more SNR for $P=2$ and $4$, respectively, for the same target BER.

\includegraphics[trim = 12mm 10mm 5mm 10mm,width=3.75in]{fig3}
\caption{BER performance comparison.}

\label{fig3}
\end{figure}


   We will now evaluate the computational complexity of the proposed system in comparison to the conventional ones. The number of IFFT operations, PAPR calculations at the transmitter and null subcarrier detection at the receiver contribute a staple part of the total complexity of the system. For this reason, the complexities contributed by these three tasks are considered here and the tasks whose complexities are common for all the methods are not considered. We compare the complexity of our proposed scheme with that of the data-null subcarrier switching based methods which do not require SI (e.g., original method~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1} and Ahmed et. al.~\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir2}). The number of IFFT operations required by the original method~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1} and our proposed one are $N_d \choose P$ and $R$, respectively. The generalized formula for the maximum number of required IFFT operations, $M_s$, in~\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir2} is derived as follows: 
   \begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
   M_s&=R+(2R-1)+(3R-2)+(4R-3)+\;.\;.\;.\;\\
   & \quad +[PR-(P-1)]\\
    & =\left(\frac{P^2}{2}+\frac{P}{2}\right)R-\left(\frac{P^2}{2}-\frac{P}{2}\right)\\
    & =\frac{P}{2}[(P+1)R-P+1]
   \end{split}
   \end{equation*}

   
\begin{table}[]
\centering
\caption{Computational Complexity Comparison}
\label{tabl2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Scheme & No. of additions & No. of multiplications \\ \hline
Original & $N_d \choose P$$(Q+4N-1)$ & $N_d \choose P$$\frac{Q+8N+2}{2}$ \\ \hline
Ahmed et. al. & $M_s(Q+4N-1)$ & $\frac{M_s(Q+8N+2)}{2}$ \\ \hline
Proposed & $R(Q+4N-1)+\frac{(4R-2P^{-1}+1)}{2P}$ & $\frac{R(Q+8N+2)}{2}+N_d$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

    Each $N$-points IFFT operation requires $\frac{N}{2}log_2(N)$ multiplications and $Nlog_2(N)$ additions. Suppose that $Q=Nlog_2(N)$. The number of additions and multiplications required in the computation of PAPR of OFDM data block of length $N$ are $4N-1$ and $4N+1$, respectively. The null detection operation of the proposed system is slightly more complex than the other methods. The required number of additions and multiplications in the detection process of the proposed system are $\frac{(4R-2P^{-1}+1)}{2P}$ and $N_d$, respectively.  A comparative complexity of the original method~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong1}, Ahmed et.~al.~\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir2}, and proposed method is given in Table~\ref{tabl2}. For $P=2$, while the maximum number of additions and multiplications needed in the original method are 847314 and 595374, respectively, the corresponding numbers are 16640 and 11726 for our proposed system, with 98.04\% and 98.03\% reduction of the total additions and multiplications, respectively. It is worth noting that the complexity of our proposed system is 66.10\% lower than that of the system presented by Ahmed et.~al.~\cite{IEEEhowto:sabbir2}.
    
    In the system like~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong2}, the no-SI advantage is compromised to reduce the system complexity and improve BER. If we consider our proposed data-null switching scheme in 'non-blind' scenario, it remains more spectrally efficient compared to~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong2}. If $P$ data-null subcarriers switchings are done, the indices of the $P$ switched null subcarriers are needed to send as SI in~\cite{IEEEhowto:wong2}. For a system of $N$ total subcarriers, the number of bits needed to send as SI becomes $Plog_2(N)$. In contrast, the non-blind scenario of the proposed system requires to send only $log_2(N)$ bits irrespective of the number of data-null switchings; this is due to the fact that since the equidistance property is maintained, only the index of the first switched null subcarriers are required to send to the receiver and all indices of the subsequent switched null subcarriers can be derived from this received index at the receiver using the equidistance property.

\section{Conclusion}
 Due to the high complexity and poor BER of the conventional data-null subcarrier switching based PAPR reduction systems, we propose an improved PAPR reduction scheme, with low computational overhead, which can decrease such effects dramatically. Compromising only 9.5\% of the PAPR reduction capability at $10^{-3}$ CCDF level, our system reduces the system complexity by more than 98\% and achieves up to 3 dB SNR gain.
