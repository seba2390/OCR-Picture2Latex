We introduced a model that learns active learning algorithms end-to-end. Our goal was to move away from engineered selection heuristics towards strategies learned directly from data. Our model leverages labeled instances from different but related tasks to learn a selection strategy for the task at hand, while simultaneously adapting its representation of the data and its prediction function.
We evaluated the model on ``active'' variants of one-shot learning tasks for Omniglot, demonstrating that its policy approaches an optimistic performance estimate. On a cold-start collaborative filtering task derived from MovieLens, the model outperforms several baselines and shows promise for application in more realistic settings.
