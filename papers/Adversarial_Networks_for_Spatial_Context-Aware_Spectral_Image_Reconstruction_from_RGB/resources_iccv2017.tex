When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
	\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
	{myfile.eps}
	\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2in} \rule{0.9\linewidth}{0pt}}
   %\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{egfigure.eps}
\end{center}
   \caption{Example of caption.  It is set in Roman so that mathematics
   (always set in Roman: $B \sin A = A \sin B$) may be included without an
   ugly clash.}
\label{fig:long}
\label{fig:onecol}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure*}
	\begin{center}
		\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2in} \rule{.9\linewidth}{0pt}}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Example of a short caption, which should be centered.}
	\label{fig:short}
\end{figure*}

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
			\hline
			Method & Frobnability \\
			\hline\hline
			Theirs & Frumpy \\
			Yours & Frobbly \\
			Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
	\verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
Frobnication has been trendy lately.
It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.
