Like Newton famously said, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants" I have come so far only with the guidance and support of all my well-wishers. I want to thank them and dedicate my thesis to each and every one of them.

First and foremost, I am grateful to Prof. K. Madhava Krishna for giving me an opportunity to explore and learn robotics at the Robotics Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad. Only because of that opportunity I had got a fundamental perspective on how to contribute to research. I am equally grateful to Dr. Spandan Roy for guiding me and supporting me to initiate my research and carry it on. Also, the love and support from my family in all the decisions that I have made are incomparable.

I am fortunate to have had great friends who have pushed me beyond my comfort zone and take research seriously. I am in debt to the trust that Hari Krishnan and Vikram Kumar have had in me while starting a new humanoid robotics team at SRM University. I belong to the community of roboticists only because the doors of SRM Team Humanoid opened for me. I am glad that I have met and been in contact with Aditya Sripada for all our technical and philosophical discussions.

I am thankful to Robotics Research Center (RRC), which welcomed me with open arms. The valuable mentoring by Gourav Kumar has given me a comprehensive overview of aerial robotics. Not to forget the significant partnership with Suraj in coursework and research that has helped me complete my degree in time. I thank everyone in RRC for the acceptance, inspiration and motivation you have given me from the beginning.

Finally, I have to thank the institute for providing a platform to aspiring minds to take up the dream of becoming a researcher and developing themselves in the process.

Thank you all.
