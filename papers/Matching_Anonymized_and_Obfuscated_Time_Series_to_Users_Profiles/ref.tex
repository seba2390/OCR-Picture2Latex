	ABSTRACT="The popularity of mobile devices and location-based services (LBS) have
	created great concerns regarding the location privacy of users of such
	devices and services. Anonymization is a common technique that is often
	being used to protect the location privacy of LBS users. In this paper, we
	provide a general information theoretic definition for location privacy. In
	particular, we define perfect location privacy. We show that under certain
	conditions, perfect privacy is achieved if the pseudonyms of users is
	changed after o(N^(2/r?1)) observations by the adversary, where N is the
	number of users and r is the number of sub-regions or locations.

	ABSTRACT="The popularity of mobile devices and location-based services (LBS) have
	created great concerns regarding the location privacy of users of such
	devices and services. Anonymization is a common technique that is often
	being used to protect the location privacy of LBS users. In this paper, we
	provide a general information theoretic definition for location privacy. In
	particular, we define perfect location privacy. We show that under certain
	conditions, perfect privacy is achieved if the pseudonyms of users is
	changed after o(N^(2/r?1)) observations by the adversary, where N is the
	number of users and r is the number of sub-regions or locations.

ABSTRACT="The popularity of mobile devices and location-based services (LBS) have
created great concerns regarding the location privacy of users of such
devices and services. Anonymization is a common technique that is often
being used to protect the location privacy of LBS users. In this paper, we
provide a general information theoretic definition for location privacy. In
particular, we define perfect location privacy. We show that under certain
conditions, perfect privacy is achieved if the pseudonyms of users is
changed after o(N^(2/r?1)) observations by the adversary, where N is the
number of users and r is the number of sub-regions or locations.
