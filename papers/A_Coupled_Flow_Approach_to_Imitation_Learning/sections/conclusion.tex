\section{Conclusion}
We presented CFIL, a unique approach to imitation learning based on the coupling of a pair of flows. CFIL introduced many novelties including its estimator for the log ratio, its smoothing and regularization and more generally its employment of flows, while we also performed a unique analysis using BC graphs and raised concerns about trends in relevant literature. Crucially, CFIL was empirically shown to outperform state-of-the-art baselines in a variety of settings with only a single expert trajectory. A future work could include coupled flows for general ratio estimation.
