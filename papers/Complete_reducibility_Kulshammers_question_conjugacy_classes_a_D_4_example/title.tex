\begin{abstract}
Let $k$ be a nonperfect separably closed field. Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $k$. We study rationality problems for Serre's notion of complete reducibility of subgroups of $G$. In particular, we present a new example of subgroup $H$ of $G$ of type $D_4$ in characteristic $2$ such that $H$ is $G$-completely reducible but not $G$-completely reducible over $k$ (or vice versa). This is new: all known such examples are for $G$ of exceptional type. We also find a new counterexample for K\"ulshammer's question on representations of finite groups for $G$ of type $D_4$. A problem concerning the number of conjugacy classes is also considered. The notion of nonseparable subgroups plays a crucial role in all our constructions.
