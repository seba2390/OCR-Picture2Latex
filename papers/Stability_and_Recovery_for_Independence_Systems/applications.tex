\section{Applications}\label{sec:applications}

Here we will see many problems \cite{peng2016approximate} that fall into the framework of $p$-extendible systems and thus, we directly have recovery results on their stable instances. Some of the problems might be hard, like Weighted Independent Set, whereas others may be easy (i.e. in $P$), having exact algorithms, however the greedy is extremely simple and fast compared to those.
