\section{Appendix}
In this supplementary material, we present various details omitted from the main text due to lack of space, including a proof of Thm~\ref{thm:thm}, a detailed analysis of the time complexity of the various modules in the training and prediction pipelines of \alg, details of the datasets and evaluation metrics used in the experiments, further clarifications about how some ablation experiments were carried out, as well as additional experimental results including a subjective comparison of the prediction quality of \alg and various competitors on handpicked recommendation examples.
