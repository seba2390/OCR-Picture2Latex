\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
\label{sup:eval}
Performance was evaluated using precision@$k$ and nDCG@$k$ metrics. Performance was also evaluated using propensity scored metrics, namely propensity scored precision@$k$ and nDCG@$k$ (with $k$ = 1, 3 and 5) for extreme classification. The propensity scoring model and values available on The Extreme Classification Repository~\citep{XMLRepo} were used for the publicly available datasets. For the proprietary datasets, the method outlined in \cite{Jain16} was used. For a predicted score vector $\hat{\mathbf{y}} \in R^L$ and ground truth label vector $\mathbf{y} \in \{0, 1\}^L$, the metrics are defined below. In the following, $p_l$ is propensity score of the label $l$ as proposed in~\citep{Jain16}.
\begin{flalign}
P@k&= \frac{1}{k} {\sum_{l \in rank_k(\hat{\mathbf{y}})}} y_l &
PSP@k&= \frac{1}{k} {\sum_{l \in rank_k(\hat{\mathbf{y}})}} \frac{y_l}{p_l} & \nonumber\\
DCG@k&= \frac{1}{k} {\sum_{l \in rank_k(\hat{\mathbf{y}})}} \frac{y_l}{\log(l+1)} \nonumber
& PSDCG@k&= \frac{1}{k} {\sum_{l \in rank_k(\hat{\mathbf{y}})}} \frac{y_l}{p_l \log(l+1)} & \nonumber\\
nDCG@k&= \frac{DCG@k}{\sum_{l=1}^{\min(k, ||\mathbf{y}||_0)} \frac{1}{\log(l +1) }} \nonumber
 &
PSnDCG@k&= \frac{PSDCG@k}{\sum_{l=1}^{k} \frac{1}{\log l +1 }} &\nonumber,
\end{flalign}
