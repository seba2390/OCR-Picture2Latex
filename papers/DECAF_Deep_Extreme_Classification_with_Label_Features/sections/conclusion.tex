\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
This paper demonstrated the impact of incorporating label metadata in the form of label text in offering significant performance gains on several product-to-product recommendation tasks. It proposed the \alg algorithm that uses a frugal architecture, as well as a scalable prediction pipeline, to offer predictions that are up to 2-6\% more accurate, as well as an order of magnitude faster, as compared to leading deep learning-based XML algorithms. \alg offers millisecond-level prediction times on a CPU making it suitable for real-time applications such as product-to-product recommendation tasks. Future directions of work include incorporating other forms of label metadata such as label-correlation graphs, as well as diverse embedding architectures.
