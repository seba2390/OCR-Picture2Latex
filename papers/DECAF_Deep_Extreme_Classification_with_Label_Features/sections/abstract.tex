Extreme multi-label classification (XML) involves tagging a data point with its most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set, with several applications such as product-to-product recommendation with millions of products. Although leading XML algorithms scale to millions of labels, they largely ignore label metadata such as textual descriptions of the labels. On the other hand, classical techniques that can utilize label metadata via representation learning using deep networks struggle in extreme settings. This paper develops the \alg algorithm that addresses these challenges by learning models enriched by label metadata that jointly learn model parameters and feature representations using deep networks and offer accurate classification at the scale of millions of labels. \alg makes specific contributions to model architecture design, initialization, and training, enabling it to offer up to 2-6$\%$ more accurate prediction than leading extreme classifiers on publicly available benchmark product-to-product recommendation datasets, such as LF-AmazonTitles-1.3M. At the same time, \alg was found to be up to 22$\times$ faster at inference than leading deep extreme classifiers, which makes it suitable for real-time applications that require predictions within a few milliseconds. The code for \alg is available at the following URL \newline \code.
