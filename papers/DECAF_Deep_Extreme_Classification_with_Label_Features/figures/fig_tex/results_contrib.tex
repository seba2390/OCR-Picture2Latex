    \caption{Quantile analysis of gains offered by \alg in terms of contribution to P@5. The label set was divided into 5 equi-voluminous bins with increasing label frequency. Quantiles increase in mean label frequency from left to right. \alg consistently outperforms other methods on all bins with the difference in accuracy being more prominent on bins containing data-scarce tail labels (e.g. bin 5).}
