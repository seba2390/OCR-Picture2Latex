    \caption{\alg's predictions on selected test points. Document and label names ending in ``$\dots$'' were abbreviated due to lack of space. Please refer to Table~12 in the \suppl for the complete table. Predictions in black and a non-bold/non-italic font were a part of the ground truth. Those in bold italics were part of the ground truth but never seen with other the ground truth labels in the training set i.e. had no common training points. Predictions in light gray were not a part of the ground truth. \alg's exploits label metadata to discover semantically correlated labels.}
