\begin{abstract}
Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese characters contains rich semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of Chinese characters. The typical method to utilize the glyph features is by incorporating them into the character embedding space. Inspired by previous methods, we innovatively propose a Chinese pre-trained representation model named as GlyphCRM, which abandons the ID-based character embedding method yet solely based on sequential character images. We render each character into a binary grayscale image and design two-channel position feature maps for it. Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network, namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information. Meanwhile, we feed the glyph features extracted from each layer of the HanGlyph module into the underlying Transformer blocks by skip-connection method to fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module can obtain a sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. Extensive experimental results indicate that GlyphCRM substantially outperforms the previous BERT-based state-of-the-art model on 9 fine-tuning tasks, and it has strong transferability and generalization on specialized fields and low-resource tasks. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the realms of well-established representation of Chinese texts.

%Typical methods generally incorporate the glyph features of Chinese characters into the character embedding space to enhance their representations.

%Previous works indicate that the glyph of Chinese character contains rich semantic information and has the potential to enhance the representation of Chinese characters. Typical methods generally incorporate the glyph features of Chinese characters into the ID-based character embedding space to enhance their representations. In this paper, different with them, we innovatively propose a multi-modal Chinese pre-trained representation model named as GlyphCRM, as its input is exclusively on character images. Formally, we first design a two-layer residual convolutional neural network, namely HanGlyph to generate the initial glyph representation of Chinese characters, and subsequently adopt multiple bidirectional encoder Transformer blocks as the superstructure to capture the context-sensitive information. Meanwhile, we fed the glyph features extracted from the HanGlyph module into the underlying Transformer blocks to fully exploit the glyph features of Chinese characters. As the HanGlyph module can obtain the sufficient glyph representation of any Chinese character, the long-standing out-of-vocabulary problem could be effectively solved. We compare our proposed model with BERT, which were pre-trained on the same large-scale Chinese corpus, on a wide range of Chinese natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Extensive experimental results indicate that the performance of GlyphCRM substantially outperforms previous BERT-based state-of-the-art method on 9 fine-tuning tasks and it converges faster during pre-training compared with BERT. We hope this work could spark further research beyond the realms of well established representation of Chinese characters.
