%In longitudinal studies with binary responses, the primary focus is on the temporal evolution of the probability of positive response. Traditional solutions attempt the problem under the generalized mixed effects modeling framework, which is restrictive due to the assumptions on the expectation and covariance structure of the binary responses. We tackle the problem from a functional data analysis perspective, treating the observations for each subject as realizations from subject-specific stochastic processes at the measured times. We assume the stochastic processes have binomial marginal distributions. Leveraging the logits representation, we can model the discrete space processes through continuous space processes, whose mean and covariance kernel are nonparametrically and simultaneously through a Gaussian process prior and an Inverse-Wishart process prior, respectively. These prior assumptions result in flexible inference for the evolution and correlation of binary responses, while allowing for borrowing of strength across subjects. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic data examples and an analysis of college studentsâ€™ mental health status data.

Longitudinal studies with binary or ordinal responses are widely encountered in 
various disciplines, where the primary focus is on the temporal evolution of the 
probability of each response category. Traditional approaches build from  
the generalized mixed effects modeling framework. Even amplified with nonparametric 
priors placed on the fixed or random effects, such models are restrictive due to the 
implied assumptions on the marginal expectation and covariance structure of the responses. 
We tackle the problem from a functional data analysis perspective, treating the 
observations for each subject as realizations from subject-specific stochastic processes 
at the measured times. %The primary designs of our proposed model focus on the 
We develop the methodology focusing initially on binary responses, for which we assume 
the stochastic processes have Binomial marginal distributions. Leveraging the logits 
representation, we model the discrete space processes through sequences of continuous 
space processes. We utilize a hierarchical framework to model the mean and covariance 
kernel of the continuous space processes nonparametrically and simultaneously through 
a Gaussian process prior and an Inverse-Wishart process prior, respectively. The prior 
structure results in flexible inference for the evolution and correlation of binary 
responses, while allowing for borrowing of strength across all subjects. The modeling 
approach can be naturally extended to ordinal responses. Here, the continuation-ratio 
logits factorization of the multinomial distribution is key for efficient modeling 
and inference, including a practical way of dealing with unbalanced longitudinal data. 
The methodology is illustrated with synthetic data examples and an analysis of 
college students' mental health status data.

%Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that, in comparison with alternative methods, the proposed Bayesian approach achieves better accuracy in both the probability response curves and covariance structure estimates.
