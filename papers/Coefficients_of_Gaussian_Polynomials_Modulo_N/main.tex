\begin{abstract}
Let $\qbinom{n}{k}$ be a $q$-binomial coefficient. Stanley conjectured that the function $f_{k}(n) = \#\left\{\alpha : [q^{\alpha}] \left[{n \atop k}\right]_q  \equiv R \pmod{N}\right\}$ is quasipolynomial for $N$ prime. We prove this for any integer $N$ and obtain an expression for the generating function $F_{k}(x)$ for $f_{k}(n)$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The $q$-analogue of the binomial coefficient is typically denoted $\qbinom{n}{k}$ and is defined by the rational expression 
\[\qbinom{n}{k} = \frac{[n]!}{[n-k]![k]!},\]
where $[n]! = \prod_{i=1}^{n}{(1-q^i)/(1-q)}$. These are polynomials with degree $k(n-k)$.

These polynomials appear in combinatorics and have connections to the theory of symmetric polynomials as well as representation theory. In particular, an important characterization is that they enumerate the Grassmannian $\mathbf{Gr}(k , \F_q^n)$:

\begin{theorem}\label{11}
The number of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $\F_q^n$ is $\qbinom{n}{k}$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent For a proof see, for example, \cite{stanley}. While $q$-binomial coefficients are common objects in combinatorics, recent works such as \cite{kronecker} or \cite{stanley2} have sparked additional interest in these objects and their coefficients.

In this paper, we investigate the behavior of these coefficients modulo some positive integer $N\in \N$. One motivation for this is the classical Lucas' theorem:
\begin{theorem}[Lucas' Theorem] For $p$ prime, let $n,k\in \N$ have base $p$ expansions $n = \sum_{i\ge 0}{n_i p^i}, k =\sum_{i\ge 0}{k_i p^i}$. Then
\[\binom{n}{k} \equiv \prod_{i\ge 0}{\binom{n_i}{k_i}} \pmod{p}.\]
\label{12}
\end{theorem}

\noindent By fixing $k$, the values of $\binom{n}{k} \pmod{p}$ can be shown to form a repeating sequence related to the base $p$ expansion of $k$. This extends to modulo $N$, as seen by the following corollary from \cite{kwongbinom}:

\begin{theorem}[Kwong \cite{kwongbinom}]
Let the prime factorization of $N$ be given by $\prod{p_i^{e_i}}$ for primes $p_i$. Then $\binom{n}{k}$ is purely periodic modulo $N$ for fixed $k$, with period
\[P = \prod{p_i^{e_i+b_i-1}},\]
where $b_i\in \N$, $p_i^{b_i-1}<k<p_i^{b_i}$.
\label{13}
\end{theorem}

\noindent Here, the term purely periodic means that a sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \N}$ has $x_{n}=x_{n+Q}$ for some $Q$ and all $n\in \N$. The $q$-binomial coefficients are an example of a ``$q$-analogue", in the sense that $\lim_{q\to 1}\qbinom{n}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$. As a result, it is reasonable to expect similar structured behavior modulo $p$ or even with general composites in the coefficients of $\qbinom{n}{k}$, since this shows $\binom{n}{k} = \lim_{q\to 1}{\qbinom{n}{k}}=\sum_{i\ge 0}{[q^i]\qbinom{n}{k}}$. Here, $[q^i]f(q)$ denotes the coefficient of $q^i$ in $f$.

We prove and generalize Conjecture \ref{16}, that the ``residue counting" function for these coefficients is a \textit{quasipolynomial}. From \cite{stanley}, we have the following definition of a quasipolynomial function:

\begin{definition}
A function $f: \N \to \mathbb{C}$ is \textit{quasipolynomial} with degree $d$ if
\[f(n) = c_d(n)n^d + c_{d-1}(n)n^{d-1} + \ldots + c_0(n)\]
where each $c_i(n)$ is a periodic function with integer period and $c_d(n)$ is not identically $0$. We call $Q$ a \textit{quasiperiod} of $f$ if it is a common period of all $c_i(n)$. Note that $Q$ is not unique, since $kQ$ is a quasiperiod for $k\in \N$.
\label{14}
\end{definition}

\noindent Equivalently, we can say $f(n)=P_i(n)$ for $n \equiv i \pmod{Q}$ where $P_i \in \Z[x]$. In order to state the main result (Theorem \ref{19}), we make the following definitions.

\begin{definition}
For a natural number $N$ that we call the \textit{modulus}, $R \in \Z/N \Z$, and $k \in \N$, we define
\[f_{k}(n) = \#\set{\alpha : [q^{\alpha}] \qbinom{n}{k}  \equiv R \pmod{N}}.\]
This function counts the number of coefficients congruent to $R$ modulo $N$.
\label{15}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
From \cite{kparts}, we see that $p_{\le k}(n)$, the number of partitions of $n$ with at most $k$ parts, is also an example of a quasipolynomial function.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Define $\pi_N(k)$ as the minimal period of $p_{\le k}(n)$ modulo $N$.
\label{17}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}

Define $\pi'_N(k)$ as follows:
\[\pi'_N(k) = \pi'_N(k-1)\lcm \left(N,\frac{\pi_N(k)}{\pi_N(k-1)}\right). \]
We set $\pi'_N(1)=1$.
\label{18}
\end{definition}

\noindent This definition makes it so that $N\mid \frac{\pi'_N(k)}{\pi'_N(k-1)}$ for $k>1$. Stanley originally conjectured the following in \cite{stanley3}:

\begin{conjecture}[Stanley \cite{stanley3}]
The function $f_{k}$ is quasipolynomial for $N$ prime.
\label{16}
\end{conjecture}

\noindent The following theorem, which generalizes Conjecture \ref{16}, is the main result of this paper. This is shown in Sections 3 and 4.

\begin{theorem}
For a modulus $N$, the function $f_{k}(n)$ is quasipolynomial, with a quasiperiod $\pi'_{N}(k)$ and degree one.
\label{19}
\end{theorem}

\noindent The idea will be to formulate an equivalent restatement in Theorem \ref{main}, which makes a more direct statement about the structure of the coefficients modulo $N$. In Section 5, we investigate the structure of the generating function
\[F_{k}(x) = \sum_{n\ge k}{f_{k}(n)x^n}.\]
In section 6, we investigate some asymptotics of the proven quasiperiod and conjectured minimal quasiperiod.

\section[Coefficients of low degree terms]{Coefficients of low degree terms in $\qbinom{n}{k}$}

We first try to understand the behavior of the coefficient of $q^i$ in $\qbinom{n}{k}$ for small $i$. The following result is well-known and follows from the identity $\sum_{i\ge 0}{p(n,k,i)q^i} = \qbinom{n+k}{k}$, where $p(n,k,i)$ denotes the number of partitions $\lambda \vdash i$ with at most $k$ parts and maximal part $\le n$. 

\begin{lemma}
 \label{21}
Let $n_0 , k\in \N$ be arbitrary, and $n \geq n_0 + k$. Then for $0 \leq i < n_0$, we have $[q^i]\qbinom{n}{k} = p_{\leq k}(i)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
A similar result is true for the last $n_0$ coefficients by the symmetry of the $q$-binomial coefficients.
\end{remark}
This warrants an investigation of the function $p_{\le k}(i)$ modulo $N$. The following theorem from \cite{NijWilf} shows that it is purely periodic, and determines the minimal period for primes. Then in \cite{kwongpart}, this is extended to prime powers. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, understanding the behavior of $p_{\le k}(i)$ modulo prime powers is sufficient to understand its behavior modulo $N$.

\begin{theorem}[Kwong]
For a prime power $p^e$, fix a set $S=\set{s_0, s_1, \ldots s_l}$ with entries in $\mathbb{N}$. Let $p(n;S)$ be given by the generating function
\[P(x;S) \eqdef \prod_{s\in S}{\frac{1}{1-x^s}} = \sum_{n\ge 0}{p(n;S)x^n},\]
hence $p(n;S)$ is the number of partitions $\lambda$ with parts in $S$ and $|\lambda |=n$. Then $p(*;S)$ is purely periodic modulo $p^e$, with minimal period 
\[\pi_{p^e}(S) = p^{b_p(S)+e-1} L_p(S)\] 
where $b_p(S)$ is the smallest integer such that 
\[p^{b_p(S)} \ge \sum_{s\in S}{p^{\nu_p(s)}}\]
where $\nu_p(s)$ is the $p$-adic valuation of $s$ and $L_p(S)\eqdef \textup{lcm}(S)/p^{\nu_p(\textup{lcm}(S))}$ is the $p$-free part of $\textup{lcm}(S)$.
\label{22}
\end{theorem}
For a more detailed discussion, see \cite{kwongpart}. Lemma \ref{21} then shows that for $n_0$ sufficiently large, the first $n_0$ coefficients of $\qbinom{n}{k}$ for $n-k\ge n_0$ will follow a repeating pattern of period $\pi_{p^e}(k)=p^{b_p([k])+e-1} L_p([k])$ modulo $p^e$. Here, $[k] \eqdef \set{1,2,\ldots k}$.

It is worth noting that the statement is slightly incorrect: the theorem does not hold in the trivial case $k=1$ where $\pi_N(k)=1$. However, there seem to be no other errors otherwise with the proof. Fortunately, this case is simple and can be ignored. From now on, we have $k\ge 2$.

\begin{definition}
Fix $k$, a modulus $N \in \N$, and $n > \pi_{N}(k)$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the sequence of the first $\pi_N(k)$ coefficients of $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ reduced mod $N$. It is given by $\mathcal{S} = (s_0, s_1, \ldots s_{\pi_{N}-1})$, where
$s_\alpha \equiv  [q^\alpha]\qbinom{n+k}{k} \pmod{N}$.

\label{buf}
\end{definition}

Theorem \ref{22} and Lemma \ref{21} show that $\mathcal{S}$ determines the periodic sequence $p_{\le k}(i)$ modulo $N$.

\begin{example}
One example of this sequence for $N=2$ and $k=3$ is shown in Figure \ref{table}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}

 \begin{tabular}{|c c c c c c c c c c c c|} 
 \hline
 $s_0$ & $s_1$ & $s_2$ & $s_3$ & $s_4$ & $s_5$ & $s_6$ & $s_7$ & $s_8$ & $s_9$ & $s_{10}$ & $s_{11}$  \\ [0.5ex]

 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Values of $\mathcal{S}$ modulo $2$.}
\label{table}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\end{example}

Next, we study $\mathcal{S}$ for prime powers $p^e$ as the modulus. The generating function of $p_{\le k}(n)$ is given by
\[P_{\le k}(q) \eqdef \sum_{n\ge 0}{p_{\le k}(n)q^n} = \frac{1}{\prod_{i\in[k]}{1-q^i}}.\]

\begin{lemma} $\textup{lcm}([k]) \mid \pi_{p^e}(k) $.
\label{24}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem 2.2, it suffices to show that $b_p([k]) \ge \nu_p(\text{lcm}([k]))$. We can then see
\[p^{b_p([k])} \ge \sum_{i\in[k]}{p^{\nu_p(i)}} \ge p^{\max_{i \in [k]}{\nu_p(i)}} = p^{\nu_p(\text{lcm}([k])}.\]
Taking logs, the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Define the operator $\Delta_{Q} : \Z[[q]] \rightarrow \Z[[q]]$ for $Q \in \N$ via the formula \begin{align*}
    (\Delta_{Q} F)(q)
    &= F(q) - q^{Q} F(q) \\
    &= \sum_{n\ge 0}{f(n)q^n} - \sum_{n\ge Q}{f(n-Q)q^n},
\end{align*}
This can be viewed as an analogue of the finite difference operator ($\Delta$, as in \cite{stanley} \S 1.9) acting on formal power series.
\label{25}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Consider the generating function $F(q) = \frac{q}{(1-q)^2} = \sum_{i\ge 0}{iq^i}$. Suppose we want to calculate $\Delta_5 F(q)$: then we have
\begin{align*}
\Delta_5 F(q) &= \frac{q}{(1-q)^2}-\frac{q^6}{(1-q)^2} \\
&= \frac{5q^5}{1-q}+(4q^4+3q^3+2q^2+1q).
\end{align*}
This demonstrates a key aspect of the $\Delta_Q$ operator: the lowest $Q$ monomials  remain unchanged, while the rest of the sequence can be viewed as a union of $Q$ subsequences with the traditional finite difference operator applied.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem}\label{26}
Fix $n,k$. Consider the sequence $\mathcal{S}$ where we take coefficients modulo $N=p^e$. Then $s_{\card{\mathcal{S}}-1}, \ldots s_{\card{\mathcal{S}}-\binom{k+1}{2}+1}$ are all $0$ modulo $N$, and $s_i = (-1)^{k+1} s_{\pi_N(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}-i}$ for $\pi_N(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}-i\ge 0$ and $i\ge 0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The main idea behind this result is to exploit the simple form of the generating function $P_{\le k}(q)$. We can re-write it as follows, letting $Q := \pi_{p^e}(k)$:
\[P_{\le k}(q) = \frac{1}{\prod_{i\in[k]}{1-q^i}} = \frac{\gamma(q)}{(1-q^{Q})^k}, \tag{1}\]
where we can obtain
\[\gamma(q) = \frac{(1-q^{Q})^k}{\prod_{i\in[k]}{1-q^i}} = \prod_{d \mid Q}{\Phi_d(q)^{f(d)}} \tag{2}\]
where $f(d) =k-\#\{i \in [k] : d \mid i\} \ge 0$ and $\Phi_d$ denotes the $d$th cyclotomic polynomial. To show (2), note that $f(d)$ accounts for every factor in the denominator, and is bounded below by $0$. This follows from Lemma \ref{24} and the fact that each cyclotomic factor of the denominator can appear at most $k$ times (at most once for each factor $(1-q^i)$). Thus we conclude that $\gamma(q) \in \Z[q]$ and that $\deg \gamma(q) = kQ - \binom{k+1}{2}$. Using $\Delta_Q$ as in Definition \ref{25}, we obtain
\[ \Delta_{Q}^k P_{\le k}(q) = \gamma(q).\]
Using the fact that $P_{\le k}(q)$ can be written as $P_{\le k}(q) \equiv \frac{\gamma_0(q)}{1-q^{Q}} \pmod{p^e}$ for some unique $\gamma_0(q)$ with $\deg \gamma_0 < Q$ by Theorem \ref{22}, we can see that $\Delta_{Q} P_{\le k}(q) \equiv \gamma_0(q) \pmod{p^e}$. It follows from this that 
\[\Delta_{Q}^{k} P_{\le k}(q) \equiv \sum_{i\ge 0}{(-1)^i\binom{k-1}{i} \gamma_0(q) q^{Q i}} \pmod{p^e},\]
using the formula for $\Delta^k f(n)$ from \cite{stanley} in \S 1.9. This is straightforward to verify using induction. Thus, for $r \in \Z / Q \Z$ we have
\[[q^{r+Q(k-1)}]\gamma(q) \equiv (-1)^{k-1}[q^r]\gamma(q) \pmod{p^e}.\]
Knowing that $\deg \gamma = kQ - \binom{k+1}{2}$, there must be $\binom{k+1}{2}-1$ zeroes at the end of $\mathcal{S}$. Furthermore, the polynomial $\gamma(q)$ can be shown to be symmetric using (2) and the symmetry of the cyclotomic polynomials (this is only true for $\Phi_d$ when $d>1$, but $d=1$ is not an issue as $f(1)=0$). Referring to Figure \ref{sym}, this shows the symmetry of $\mathcal{S}$ when the trailing zeroes are ignored: by the symmetry of $\gamma(q)$, the elements with label $i$ in Figure \ref{sym} are equal. These are also identical instances of $\mathcal{S}$ without the trailing zeroes up to sign, so $\set{s_{0}, \ldots s_{\card{\mathcal{S}}-\binom{k+1}{2}}}$ is symmetric or ``anti-symmetric" about its center. Precisely, this says that $s_i = (-1)^{k+1} s_{\pi_N(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}-i}$.

\end{proof}

These ideas can be generalized using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.


\begin{lemma}
\label{27}
Partitions with at most $k$ parts are purely periodic modulo $N$ for all $N \in \N$, with period
\[ \pi_N(k) = \underset{p|N}{\lcm}{\bra{\pi_{p^{\nu_p(N)}}(k)}}.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
Theorem \ref{26} also holds for $\mathcal{S}$ for arbitrary moduli $N$.
\label{28}
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
Let $k\ge 0$ and $N$ be odd.  If $k$ is odd and $\textup{gcd}\bra{\frac{\pi_N(k+1)}{\pi_N(k)}, N}>1$, then we have
\[\frac{\pi_N(k+1)}{\pi_N(k)}\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}.\]
Otherwise we have the stronger result $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$.
\label{29}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, we prove this for when $k$ is even. We have two cases. First, suppose $\frac{\pi_N(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}+1}{2}\not \in \Z$. This means there exists a ``central" element that is self-inverse ($x=-x$ mod $N$) in $\mathcal{S}$ by Corollary \ref{28}. Since $N$ is odd it is $0$ mod $N$. Using Corollary \ref{28} we pair all other terms in $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}$ in zero-sum pairs.

Otherwise, $\frac{\pi_N(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}+1}{2}\in \Z$. There is no central entry, and pairing via Corollary \ref{28} suffices to show $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)} \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$.


For $k$ odd, we use a different method since $(-1)^{k+1}=1$. We have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k+1)\Z}{p_{\le k+1}(i)-p_{\le k}(i)} &\equiv \sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k+1)\Z}{p_{=(k+1)}(i)} \pmod{N}\\
&\equiv \sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k+1)\Z}{p_{\le k+1}(i-(k+1))} \pmod{N}\\
&\equiv 0 \pmod{N}. \quad (\text{by even case, shift invariance})
\end{align*}
Thus, we obtain
\[\frac{\pi_N(k+1)}{\pi_N(k)}\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}\]
Unless $\text{gcd}\bra{\frac{\pi_N(k+1)}{\pi_N(k)}, N}>1$, the stronger statement  $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$ holds since $\frac{\pi_N(k+1)}{\pi_N(k)}$ would be invertible modulo $N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Suppose $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0\pmod{N}$ for odd $N$. Then the same holds for modulo $2N$ and $\pi_{2N}$ given $\frac{\pi_2(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}+1}{2}\in \Z$. \label{210}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Because $\pi_N(k)\mid \pi_{2N}(k)$, we get that $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_{2N}(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0\pmod{N}$. Next, consider the sum modulo $2$. We have $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_2(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)} \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, since modulo $2$ the symmetry relation in Theorem \ref{26} becomes $s_i \equiv - s_{\pi_2(k)-\binom{k+1}{2}-i}$ because $1\equiv -1$ modulo $2$ - hence, the reasoning in Theorem \ref{29} even $k$ applies to all $k$. Since $\pi_2(k) \mid \pi_{2N}(k)$, we see that
\[\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi_{2N}(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0\pmod{2}.\]
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this is $0$ modulo $2N$.
\end{proof}

\section[Decomposition into sections]{Decomposition of $\qbinom{n}{k}$}

In this section and the next, we exploit the results from Section 2 regarding the periodicity of $\mathcal{S}$ and the structure of $\mathcal{S}$ (as described by Theorem \ref{26}) in order to prove Theorem \ref{18}.

\begin{definition}
For a modulus $N$, we define the function $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ by
$$f_{k}(n) = \mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}\left( \frac{n-i}{\pi'_N(k)}\right),$$
if $n\equiv i \pmod{\pi'_N(k)}$.
\label{31}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The change of variables $n \mapsto \frac{n-i}{\pi'_{N}(k)}$ is used to simplify proofs.
\end{remark}
The aim is now to show that the functions $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ are linear, from which it follows by definition that $f_{k}$ is quasipolynomial. To do this, we will use the following general strategy:

\begin{itemize}
\item Partition the coefficients of $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ into different classes with periodic behavior.
\item Using the periodicity of the first $\pi_N(k)$ coefficients (by Lemma \ref{27}), inductively show that these sections are also periodic using a partition decomposition (Lemma \ref{34}).
\item Use this last fact to show that $n \mapsto n+\pi'_N(k)$ changes $f_{k}(n+r)$ a constant amount depending only on $r$.
\item Conclude $f_{k}$ is quasipolynomial, since the previous point shows $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ are linear.
\end{itemize}

We begin with the division of coefficients in $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ into different sections.

\begin{definition}
The $i$th \textit{section} of the $q$-binomial coefficient $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ is the sequence of coefficients denoted by $\mathsf{S}_i$ with $j$th term given by
\[p_{\le k}^{(i)}(j) = [q^{in+j}]\qbinom{n+k}{k},\]
where $j\in \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. As a special case, $\mathsf{S}_0$ is just a concatenation of copies of $\mathcal{S}$.
\label{32}
\end{definition}

Recall the identity
\[\sum_{i\ge 0}{p(n,k,i)q^i} = \qbinom{n+k}{k},\]
where $p(n,k,i)$ denotes the number of partitions $\lambda \vdash i$, with at most $k$ parts and maximal part $\le n$. 

This definition allows us to loosely determine a section by saying terms in the sequence contain the number of partitions which fit in a $n\times k$ box of size $|\lambda|=l$ for $l$ such that there exists a partition $\lambda \vdash l$ covering $i$ complete rows but no partition covering $i+1$ rows.

\begin{definition}
\label{33}
Let $X=(x_0, \ldots , x_{|X|-1})$ and $Y=(y_0, \ldots , y_{|Y|-1})$ be finite sequences. The concatenation operator $\oplus$ is defined as $X \oplus Y = (x_0, x_1, \ldots x_{|X|-1}, y_0, y_1, \ldots y_{|Y|-1}).$
\end{definition}
We then make the following decomposition of $\mathsf{S}_i$ that proves useful:
\[\mathsf{S}_i = \mathsf{B}_i^1 \oplus \mathsf{B}_i^2 \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathsf{B}_i^l \oplus \mathsf{R}_i,\]
where the $\mathsf{B}_i^j$ are $\pi'_N(k)$-length subsequences and $\mathsf{R}_i$ is the remainder after these $l=\floor{\frac{n}{\pi'_N(k)}}$ consecutive subsequences are removed from $\mathsf{S}_i$. Informally, if we regard $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ as a sequence ordered by the associated exponents of $q$, we can relate $X=\bigoplus_{i\in [k]}{\mathsf{S}_{i-1}}\oplus{(1)}$ to its corresponding $q$-binomial coefficient. Here, $(1)$ is just a sequence only containing $1$. We can index $X$ starting at $0$, obtaining
\[\qbinom{n+k}{k} = \sum_{x_i \in X}{x_i q^i}.\]
The net result of this decomposition is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sb}.

\section[Proving the main theorem]{Proving $f_{k}$ is quasipolynomial}

Using the definitions from Section 3, we investigate the structure of each individual section.

\begin{definition} Fix a $q$-binomial coefficient $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$. Let $\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}(j)$ be the set containing all pairs of partitions $(\lambda, \mu)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $|\lambda|+|\mu|=mn+j$.
\item $\lambda$ has at most $k$ parts each at most $n$, of which $i$ are equal to $n$.
\item $\mu$ has exactly $i$ parts.
\end{itemize}
\label{pbad}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Fix $n,m, k$. For $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ we have the following identity for the associated functions $p_{\le k}^{(m)}$:
\[p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) = p_{\le k}(mn+j)- \sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}.\] \label{34}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be the set of partitions counted by $p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j)$ and $S'$ be defined similarly for $p_{\le k}(mn+j)$. It is clear that $S\subseteq S'$, so we wish to show that $\sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}$ enumerates all of the additional partitions that ``leave the $n\times k$ box" or have some part greater than $n$. Consider Figure \ref{lemma} below.

\caption{Classification of partitions in $\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)$}
\label{lemma}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{lemma} depicts a pair $(\lambda, \mu) \in \mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)$. Here, $\lambda$ is represented by the shaded boxes inside the $n \times k$ box. The darker boxes depict the $i$ parts of $\lambda$ that are exactly $n$, while the lighter gray boxes below depict the part of $\lambda$ that can vary. Outside of the $n\times k$ boxes is $\mu$, with precisely $i$ parts. As labelled in the diagram, it is easy to see that $\lambda$ are enumerated by $p_{\le k-i}^{(m-i)}$ and $\mu$ are enumerated by $p_{=i}$.
Construct a partition $\Pi = \lambda+\mu$ via part-wise addition. This is counted in $S'$ by $p_{\le k}$ but not in $S$ since it \textit{must} leave the $n\times k$ box. Thus, sending $(\lambda,\mu) \in \bigcup_{i\in [m]}{\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}$ to $\Pi=\lambda+\mu$ is a map $\phi$ from $\bigcup_{i\in [m]}{\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}$ to $S'\setminus S$. We claim $\phi$ is a bijection. It is not too difficult to see that $\phi$ is an injection: if $\lambda+\mu = \lambda'+\mu'$ then $\mu$ and $\mu'$ have the same number of parts and from this it is evident $\mu=\mu', \lambda=\lambda'$.

Now we show $\phi$ is a surjection. Take a ``bad" partition $\Pi = \{\pi_1, \ldots , \pi_k\}$ with $|\Pi|=mn+j$ leaving the box. Such a partition must leave the box for the first $i$ rows for some $i\in [m]$ (we cannot have $i>m$, since $|\Pi| = mn+j\le (m+1)n$). Setting $\mu = \{\pi_\alpha - n : \pi_\alpha>n\}$ and $\lambda = \{ \pi_\alpha : \pi_\alpha \le n \} \cup \{n : \pi_\alpha>n\}$, we construct a pair $(\lambda, \mu)$. Both $\lambda,\mu$ satisfy the last two conditions of Definition \ref{pbad} due to the construction. The first condition $|\lambda|+|\mu|=mn+j$ is also satisfied, as
\[|\lambda|+|\mu|=\sum_{\pi_\alpha>n}{(\pi_\alpha-n)+n}+\sum_{\pi_\alpha\le n}{\pi_\alpha}=|\Pi|=mn+j.\]
Thus $(\lambda,\mu) \in \mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)$, and $\lambda+\mu=\Pi$.

Thus, we have a bijection $\phi$ from $\bigcup_{i\in [m]}{\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}$ to $S'\setminus S$, and it follows that 
\[\sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)}=|S'\setminus S|.\] \end{proof}

The following is a restatement of Theorem \ref{19} and is the main result. 
\begin{theorem}
Let $N\in \N$ be the modulus of $f_{k}$. Then $f_{k}$ is quasipolynomial, with quasiperiod $\pi_{N}'(k)$. Additionally, all $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ are linear functions. \label{main} \end{theorem} \begin{proof}

Let $Q \eqdef \pi_{N}'(k)$. To prove the claim, the central idea of the argument is to show that in the section $\mathsf{S}_i$ of $\qbinom{Ql+r+k}{k}$ we have $\mathsf{B}_i^1\equiv \mathsf{B}_i^2\equiv \ldots \equiv \mathsf{B}_i^l \pmod{N}$. From this fact, we make a simple argument that shows the claim. We use the $q$-binomial coefficient $\qbinom{n+k}{k}=\qbinom{Ql+k+r}{k}$ so that we can read off that $\mathsf{B}_i$ have length $Q$,  $\mathsf{R}_i$ has length $r$, and that $l$ is the number of $\mathsf{B}_i$ in the decomposition of $\mathsf{S}_i$.

To prove that $\mathsf{B}_i^1\equiv \mathsf{B}_i^2\equiv \ldots \equiv \mathsf{B}_i^l \pmod{N}$, we induct on the indices $m=1, 2, \ldots, k-1$ of the sections, holding $k$ fixed, and then induct on $k$.

In \S 2, we already showed that $\mathsf{S}_0$ has the aforementioned property for all $k$ by considering partitions with at most $k$ parts. One can also show that $\mathsf{B}_i^1=\mathsf{B}_i^2=\ldots = \mathsf{B}_i^l$ holds when $k=2$ by explicit computation of $p_{\le 2}(j)=\floor{\frac{j}{2}}+1.$ This establishes the base cases $m=*, k=2$ and $m=0, k=*$. 

We show the claim holds for $\mathsf{S}_m$ assuming it holds for $\mathsf{S}_{i}$ ($i<m$) and all smaller $k$. Using Lemma \ref{34}, we have for $j \in \mathbb{Z}/(Ql+r)\mathbb{Z}$,
\begin{align*}
p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) &\equiv p_{\le k}(j+mr)- \sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)} \\
&\equiv p_{\le k}(j+mr)-\sum_{i\in[m]}{\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}} \pmod{N} \tag{3} \\
\end{align*}
where $C_{i,m}(j) = |\lambda|+|\mu|-ni$ for $(\lambda, \mu) \in \mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)$ (or more explicitly $C_{i,m}(j)=(m-i)(Ql+r)+j$) and $\ell, \ell' \ge 0$. The functions $p_{=i}$ and $[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}$ count $\mu$ and $\lambda$ in $\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}$ respectively in (3). Note that
\[p_{=i}(\ell) = p_{\le i}(\ell-i),\]
an explicit bijection being given by taking $\tau \vdash n$ counted by $p_{=i}$ and decreasing each part by one. Thus, we see $p_{=i}$ has period $Q$ as $\pi_N(i) | \pi_N(k) | Q$. We claim that the map $j \mapsto j+Q$ leaves $p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j)$ unchanged modulo $N$, or that $p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j+Q)-p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$. Note here that $j+Q<n$, otherwise this statement does not make sense (so for example, $l \ge 1$ so we have a complete block $\mathsf{B}_i$). Since $p_{\le k}$ has period $\pi_N(k) \mid \pi'_N(k)$, the function $p_{\le k}$ will vanish in the difference. So it suffices to show that $\Delta:=\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j+Q)-\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$.

\begin{align*}\Delta &\equiv {\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j+Q)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}}-{\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}}\\
&\equiv \sum_{\substack{\ell+\ell' \equiv j \\ (\textup{mod } Q)}}{p_{\le k-i}^{(m-i)}(\ell)p_{=i}(\ell')}. \pmod{N} \tag{4}
\end{align*}
The final congruence requires some elaboration. Here, we observe that $\ell$ determines $\ell'$ entirely, and that $C_{i,m}(j+Q)-C_{i,m}(j)=Q$. Since $p_{=i}(\ell')$ has period $Q$ modulo $N$, we can add $Q$ to $\ell'$ to eliminate all terms except for $C_{i,m}(j)< \ell \le C_{i,m}(j+Q)$. The exact bounds for $\ell$ are unimportant, since $p_{=i}(0)=0$ and hence we can ignore terms where $\ell'\equiv 0 \pmod{Q}$ in the sum - thus, equivalently we have $C_{i,m}(j)\le \ell \le C_{i,m}(j+Q)$ or $C_{i,m}(j)\le \ell < C_{i,m}(j+Q)$. Hence, this corresponds to $p_{\le k-i}^{(m-i)}(\overline{\ell}):=[q^{(m-i)n+\overline{\ell}}]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}$ for $\overline{\ell}\in \Z/Q\Z$. Note that since $l\ge 1$, this stays within bounds for $\ell$ for $p_{\le k-i}^{(m-i)}(\ell)$.

In the final sum in (4), $\ell, \ell' \in \Z/Q\Z$. It follows immediately from the definition of $\pi'_N(k)$ that $\pi_{N}'(k)/\pi_{N}'(k-1) \in N\mathbb{Z}$. But note that $p_{\le k-i}^{(m-i)}$ and $p_{=i}$ have periods dividing $\pi_{N}'(k-1)$ as it is always true that $1\le i\le k-1$ for each sum, and hence residues modulo $N$ are repeated some multiple of $N$ times in the sum. Thus $p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j)$ is $Q$-periodic since the sum is $0$ modulo $N$, and by strong induction the same is true for each $\mathsf{S}_m$. This completes the induction.

Then $l \mapsto l+1$ simply adds on another identical period in each $\mathsf{S}_m$. Hence, we may write
\[\mathsf{S}_i = \mathsf{B}_i \oplus \mathsf{B}_i \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathsf{B}_i \oplus \mathsf{R}_i,\]
where the $\mathsf{B}_i$ are identical modulo $N$. For short, denote this $\mathsf{S}_i = \mathsf{B}_i^{\oplus l}\oplus\mathsf{R}_i$. More importantly, this indicates that  $f_{k}(Q(l+1)+r)-f_{k}(Ql+r)$ is a constant depending on $r$. Thus, we can write
\[f_{k}(n)=\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}\left(\frac{n-i}{Q}\right),\]
which is precisely what we wanted.
\end{proof}


The decomposition used in the Theorem \ref{main} also allows us to prove the following observation about a special case of $p_{\le k}^{(m)}$:

\begin{corollary}
The last $\binom{k+1-m}{2}-1$ entries of each component $\mathsf{B}_m^i$ of $\mathsf{S}_m$ are $0$ modulo $N$ for $\qbinom{\pi'_N(k)l+k}{k}$. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This is given for $m=0$ by Corollary \ref{28}, so let $m>0$. Similarly, $k=2$ is trivial. We proceed by strong induction on $k,m$. By Lemma \ref{34}, for $j \in \mathbb{Z}/\pi'_N(k)l\mathbb{Z}$ we have

\[p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) \equiv p_{\le k}(j)- \sum_{i\in[m]}{\#\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}}(j) \pmod{N}.\]
Noting that $\binom{a}{2} < \binom{b}{2}$ when $a<b$ we see for $j\in[\pi'_N(k) - \binom{k+1-m}{2}, \pi'_N(k)-1]$ that $p_{\le k}(j)\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$ by Corollary \ref{28}. Therefore, for such $j$ we have the simplified form
$p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) \equiv -\sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}(j)} \pmod{N}$. We wish to show $\sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}(j)} \equiv 0 \pmod{N}$ for such $j$. To do this, we use the expansion of $\#\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}(j)$ from the main theorem and exploit that $\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j+\pi'_N(k))\equiv \#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j) \pmod{N}$ to obtain
\begin{align*}
\#\mathcal{P}_{i,m}^{\textup{bad}}(j) &\equiv \sum_{\ell+\ell'=j}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')} \pmod{N} \\
&\equiv \sum_{\substack{\ell+\ell' \equiv j \\ (\textup{mod }\pi'_N(k))}}{p_{\le k-i}^{(0)}(\ell)p_{=i}(\ell')} \pmod{N}
\end{align*}
The final congruence is because the last $\binom{(k-i)+1}{2}-1 \ge \binom{k+1-m}{2}-1$ entries of $[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}$ are $0$ by Corollary \ref{28} and Lemma \ref{21} as $\ell < \pi'_N(k)$. All added terms in the summation will have $\ell, \ell'$ lie in the interval $[j, \pi'_N(k)-1]$ and our specifically chosen $j$ makes it so that each new term added must then be $0$ mod $N$. The final sum is $0$ modulo $N$ for the same reasons as in the main theorem, since $k-1\ge i\ge 1$ and hence as a function of $\ell$ the function $p_{\le k-i}^{(0)}(\ell)p_{=i}(\ell')$ has a period $P$ so $\pi'_N(k)/P\in N\Z$ by definition of $\pi'_N(k)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Using the symmetry of the $q$-binomial coefficients, we can show that a similar claim holds for the first entries of $\mathsf{B}_m^i$. Explicitly, the first $\binom{k+1-((k-1)-m)}{2}-1=\binom{m+2}{2}-1$ entries are $0$ modulo $N$.
\end{remark}

\section[The generating function]{The generating function of $f_{k}$}

The result from the previous section allows for the generating function for $f_{k}$ to be explicitly calculated.

\begin{theorem}
For a modulus $N \in \N$, we have
\[F_{k}(x) \eqdef \sum_{n\ge 0}{f_{k}(n)x^n} = \frac{1}{(1-x^{Q})^2}\sum_{i \in \Z/Q\Z}{(1-x^{Q})b_ix^i+m_ix^{Q+i}},\]
where $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ has constant term $b_i$ and slope $m_i$ and $Q=\pi'_N(k)$.
\label{41}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For simplicity, let $\mathcal{L}_i =\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$, and $Q=\pi'_N(k)$ as above. Then we let $F_{\mathcal{L}_i}(x) = \sum_{j\ge 0}{\mathcal{L}_i(j)x^{jQ + i}},$ so that
\[F_{k}(x) = \sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{F_{\mathcal{L}_i}(x)}.\]
Fortunately, each term is simple to find. We have
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{F_{\mathcal{L}_i}(x)} &= \sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{x^i \left(\sum_{j\ge 0}{b_ix^{jQ}}+\sum_{j\ge 0}{m_i j x^{jQ}} \right)}\\
&= \sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{x^i \left(\frac{b_i}{1-x^{Q}} + \frac{m_ix^{Q}}{(1-x^{Q})^2}\right)} \\ &=\frac{1}{(1-x^Q)^2}\sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{(1-x^{Q})b_ix^i+m_ix^{Q+i}}
\end{align*}
which proves the theorem.

\end{proof}

Letting $Q'=\pi'_N(k-1)$, it turns out that one can often rewrite this as 
\[F_{k}(x)=\frac{1}{(1-x^{Q})^2}\left(\sum_{i\in \Z/Q\Z}{(1-x^{Q})b_ix^i+\sum_{i\in \Z/Q'\Z}{m_ix^{Q+i}\frac{x^{Q}-1}{x^{Q'}-1}}}\right).\]
This stems from the fact that the slopes of the functions $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ often have a smaller period (in $i$, where $k,R$ are fixed) than the actual quasiperiod itself, namely $Q'$. This is formalized by Theorem \ref{period}, and an example is given in Figure \ref{illustration}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{counterexample.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{An illustration of Theorem \ref{period}.} This figure shows the slopes of the functions $\mathcal{L}_{4}^{(i)}$ when $N=5, R=1$. The horizontal axis is $i$, while the vertical axis is the slope. Notice that the slopes have a period that is half of the actual minimal quasiperiod (in this case, given by the function $\pi_5$) and $\pi_5(4)/\pi_5(3)=60/30=2,$ as claimed.}
\label{illustration}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\qbinom{n+k}{k}$ be a $q$-binomial coefficient where $n>\pi'_N(k)$ so that we have an entire block $\mathsf{B}_i$ in each section. Fix a pair $(k,N)$ such that $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi'_N(k)\Z}{p_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$ by Theorem \ref{29}. Then $\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi'_N(k)\Z}{p^{(m)}_{\le k}(i)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N}$.
\label{0sum}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We use Lemma \ref{34}. This yields, following the same expansion as in Theorem \ref{main},
\[p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) \equiv p_{\le k}(j+mn)-\sum_{i\in[m]}\left({\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}}\right) \pmod{N}.\]
Summing over $j\in \Z/\pi'_N(k)\Z$, by assumption the $p_{\le k}$ term disappears since $p_{\le k}$ has period $\pi_N(k)$. It suffices to show that
\[\sum_{j\in \Z/\pi'_N(k)\Z} {\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}} \equiv 0 \pmod{N}.\]
We can equivalently sum over $\ell$ and then $\ell'$ so that $\ell + \ell' \in [C_{i,m}(0),C_{i,m}(\pi'_N(k)-1)]$. Suppose that $\ell \le C_{i,m}(0)$. Observe that \[\sum_{j\in \Z/\pi'_N(k)\Z}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell'+j)}\equiv 0 \pmod{N},\]
since $[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}$ is fixed and $p_{=i}(\ell)$ is $p_{\le i}(\ell-i)$ and so this sum becomes $0$ by our assumption. 

We need to show that the sum of all terms $\ell>C_{i,m}(0)$ is zero. Our reformulation gives us a sum over $\ell$ and $\ell'$ so $\ell+\ell' \le C_{i,m}(\pi'_N(k)-1)$ and $\ell>C_{i,m}(0)$. Although we can ignore $\ell=C_{i,m}(0)$ because it have no contribution, we include it in the following calculation to make it simpler. We can observe that by the restrictions on $n$ that $[q^{\ell}]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}$ stays in the same section. Let $Q=\max(\pi'_N(k-i),\pi'_N(i))$. Each possible pairing $([q^{\ell}]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}, p_{=i}(\ell'))$ modulo $N$ is repeated a multiple of $\sum_{x\in[\pi'_N(k)/Q]}{x}=\frac{1}{2}(\pi'_N(k)/Q)(\pi'_N(k)/Q+1)$ times due to their respective periods. But since $N$ divides $\pi'_N(k)/Q$ ($i\le m \le k-1$) and $N$ is odd (the pairs in Theorem \ref{29} have odd $N$), this is a multiple of $N$ and hence the entire sum becomes $0$ modulo $N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Fix a pair $(k,N)$ such that
\[\sum_{i\in \Z/\pi'_N(k-1)\Z}{p_{\le k-1}(i)}\equiv 0. \pmod{N}\]
by Theorem \ref{29}. Then the slope of $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ is equal to that of $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i')}$ where $i' \equiv i+\pi'_N(k-1) \pmod{\pi'_N(k)}$.
\label{period} 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In order to prove the theorem, we actually make a deeper claim. Consider the $q$-binomial coefficients $\qbinom{n+k}{k}, \qbinom{\widetilde{n}+k}{k}$ where $\widetilde{n} = n+\pi'_N(k-1)$ and decompose the coefficients into $\mathsf{S}_i$ and $\widetilde{\mathsf{S}}_i$ respectively. Then when we make the decompositions $\mathsf{S}_i = \mathsf{B}_i^{\oplus l} \oplus \mathsf{R}_i$ and $\widetilde{\mathsf{S}}_i = \widetilde{\mathsf{B}}_i^{\oplus l} \oplus \widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_i$, we want to show that $\mathsf{B}_i$ is a cyclic shift of $\widetilde{\mathsf{B}}_i$. Since the main theorem implies that $\mathsf{B}_i$ is determined by the residue class of $n \pmod{\pi'_N(k)}$, it suffices to show this for $n$ sufficiently large.

Using Lemma \ref{34}, we have 
\[p_{\le k}^{(m)}(j) \equiv p_{\le k}(j+mn)-\sum_{i\in[m]}\left({\sum_{\ell+\ell' = C_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')}}\right) \pmod{N}\]
where $C_{i,m}(j) = (m-i)n+j$. Now we take $n \mapsto \widetilde{n}=n+\pi'_N(k-1)$ and obtain a function $\widetilde{p}_{\le k}^{(m)}(j)$ for $\widetilde{\mathsf{S}}_m$. If we take $j \mapsto \widetilde{j}=j+m\pi'_N(k-1)$, we claim that
\[p_{\le k}^{(m)}(\widetilde{j}) \equiv  \widetilde{p}^{(m)}_{\le k}(j) \pmod{N}.\]
This is equivalent to $\mathsf{B}_i$ being a cyclic shift of $\widetilde{\mathsf{B}}_i$. Here, we are implicitly taking $\tilde{j} \pmod{\pi'_N(k)}$ and treating $p_{\le k}^{(m)}$ as a periodic sequence - this avoids confusion with $\widetilde{\mathsf{R}}_i$, as the shift is within each block $\mathsf{B}_i \mapsto \widetilde{\mathsf{B}}_i$. Using Lemma \ref{34} again, we see this is equivalent to
\[p_{\le k}(\widetilde{j}+mn)-\sum_{i\in[m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(\widetilde{j})} \equiv p_{\le k}(j+m\widetilde{n})-\sum_{i\in[m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(j)} \pmod{N}.\]

As $\widetilde{j}+mn=j+m\widetilde{n}$, we need only consider the sums $\sum_{i\in [m]}{\#\mathcal{P}^{\textup{bad}}_{i,m}(\cdot)}$. We want to show that this is invariant modulo $N$ under $j \mapsto \widetilde{j}$ and $n\mapsto \widetilde{n}$. We get for individual terms (indexed by $i$) the difference
\[ \sum_{\ell+\ell' = {C}_{i,m}(\widetilde{j})}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')} - \sum_{\ell+\ell' = \widetilde{C}_{i,m}(j)}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')} \pmod{N} \]
where $\widetilde{C}_{i,m}(j) = (m-i)\widetilde{n}+j$, differing from $C_{i,m}(j)$ by a multiple of $\pi'_N(k-1)$. We claim that this is $0$ for $i>1$. Because $p_{=i}$ has period $\pi_N(i) \mid \pi'_N(k-1)$ and $\pi'_N(k-1)\mid {C}_{i,m}(\widetilde{j})-\widetilde{C}_{i,m}(j)$, we can add this quantity to $\ell'$ in the second sum (leaving it unchanged) to cancel terms. After this, we are left with
\[\sum_{\substack{\ell + \ell' = {C}_{i,m}(\widetilde{j}) \\ \ell > \widetilde{C}_{i,m}(j)}}{[q^\ell]\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i}p_{=i}(\ell')} \pmod{N}.\]
The difference is ${C}_{i,m}(\widetilde{j})-\widetilde{C}_{i,m}(j)=i\pi'_N(k-1)$. For $k-1>i>1$, recall the division of residues in $\qbinom{n+(k-i)}{k-i} \pmod{N}$ - the blocks have size $\pi'_N(k-i) = \text{len}(\mathsf{B_\bullet})$ in each section. For $n$ sufficiently large, we can keep all $\ell$ in the same section as $n=\text{len}(\mathsf{S}_\bullet)$ and $i\pi'_N(k-1)$ is independent of $n$. Note also that $\pi'_N(i)$ is a period of $p_{=i}$. As $\pi'_N(k-1)/\pi'_N(k-i), \pi'_N(k-1)/\pi'_N(i)\in N\Z$ for $1<i<k-1$, this implies the entire sum is $0$ because we repeat each period a multiple of $N$ times and either $\pi'_N(i) \mid \pi'_N(k-i)$ or the other way around. At $i=k-1$, the $q$-binomial coefficient has all coefficients $1$ so this becomes $0$ by the restrictions on $(k,N)$. For $i=1$, $p_{=1}(\ell')=1$ and the sum is $0$ again by the restrictions on $(k,N)$ and Theorem \ref{0sum}, since $n$ is large enough that the $\ell$ values stay in the same section and we just sum over a period $i$ times.

Thus, for sufficiently large $n$ we have $p_{\le k}^{(m)}(\widetilde{j}) = \widetilde{p}^{(m)}_{\le k}(j)$. We conclude that $\widetilde{\mathsf{B}}_i$ is a cyclic shift of $\mathsf{B}_i$ and the result follows since the slopes of $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ depend only on the number of occurrences of the residue $R$ in each $\mathsf{B}_i$ (which clearly is the same under a cyclic shift).
\end{proof}

\section{Asymptotics for the quasiperiod}
Given the complex nature of the definition for $\pi'_N(k)$ it is worth investigating asymptotics to understand how quickly $f_{k}(n)$ and its generating function grow in complexity. First we investigate asymptotics for $\pi_p(k)$ for each prime $p$. We have the expansion
\[\pi_p(k) = p^{b_p([k])} L_p([k]),\]
where $b_p([k])$ and $L_p([k])$ are as previously defined in Theorem \ref{22}. Note that $\text{lcm}([k]) = e^{\psi(k)}$ where $\psi(k)$ is the Chebyshev function. Let \[\Pi(k) \eqdef \sum_{i\in[k]}{p^{\nu_p(i)}}.\]
We first consider the asymptotics of this function in Lemma \ref{51}.

\begin{lemma}\[\Pi(k) = \sum_{i\in[k]}{p^{\nu_p(i)}} \sim \frac{p-1}{p}k\log_p(k).\]
\label{51}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This can be done by observing that $\sum_{i\in[k]}{p^{\nu_p(i)}} = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor \log_p(k) \rfloor}{\#V_{i,p} p^i}$, where $V_{i,p} = \{ j | j\in[k],  \nu_p(j) = i\}$. Now we can take $\#V_{i,p} = \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^{i+1}} \right\rfloor$, yielding
\[\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor \log_p(k) \rfloor}{\#V_{i,p} p^i} = \sum_{i\ge 0}{ \left( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i}\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^{i+1}} \right\rfloor \right)p^i} \sim  (p-1) \left(\sum_{i\ge 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right\rfloor p^{i-1}}\right).\]
We now want to show $\sum_{i\ge 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right\rfloor p^{i-1}} \sim \frac{k\log_p(k)}{p}$ for large $k$. That is, we want to show that $\lim_{k \to \infty}{\frac{k\log_p(k)}{\sum_{i\ge 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right\rfloor p^{i}}}} = 1$. We obtain upper and lower bounds for the limit via $\frac{k}{p^i}\ge \lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \rfloor \ge \frac{k}{p^i}-1$, yielding the bounds
\[k\log_p(k) \ge \sum_{i\ge 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right\rfloor p^{i}} \ge k\bra{\log_p(k)-1-\frac{p}{p-1}}. \]
Upon dividing we see
\[\frac{k\log_p(k)}{\sum_{i\ge 1}{\left\lfloor \frac{k}{p^i} \right\rfloor p^{i}}} \le \frac{k\log_p(k)}{k(\log_p(k)-1-\frac{p}{p-1})} = 1+\frac{(1+\frac{p}{p-1})k}{k\log_p(k)-(1+\frac{p}{p-1})k}.\]
Thus, the limit is bounded above by 1. The lower bound clearly goes to 1, and we conclude that
\[\sum_{i\in[k]}{p^{\nu_p(i)}} \sim \frac{p-1}{p}k\log_p(k).\] 
\end{proof}

\noindent The following lemma will be useful in understanding $L_p([k])$.

\begin{lemma}
$\nu_p(\textup{lcm}([k])) = \lfloor \log_p(k)\rfloor$.
\label{52}
\end{lemma}

\noindent Now we can make an asymptotic analysis for the log of $\pi_p(k)$, since we have asymptotics relating to both components of $\pi_p(k)$.

\begin{theorem} We have
\begin{align*}
\log_p(\pi_p(k)) &\sim \log_p\log_p(k) + \frac{\psi(k)}{\ln p}.
\end{align*}
\label{53}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Using Lemma \ref{52}, we see
\[\pi_p(k) = p^{b_p([k])}L_p([k]) = \text{lcm}([k])p^{b_p([k]) - \lfloor \log_p(k) \rfloor}.\]
This can be simplified to 

\begin{align*} 
\log_p\pi_p(k) &= \frac{\psi(k)}{\ln p}+\bra{b_p([k]) - \lfloor \log_p(k) \rfloor} \\
&=\frac{\psi(k)}{\ln p}+\bra{\lceil \log_p\Pi(k) \rceil - \lfloor \log_p(k) \rfloor}.  \tag{5}
\end{align*}
We use Lemma \ref{51} to show $\log_p\Pi(k) \sim \log_p\left(\frac{p-1}{p}k\log_p(k) \right)$. Ignoring constant terms, we simplify this asymptotic to
\[\log_p\Pi(k) \sim \log_p\log_p(k)+\log_p(k),\]
and in the limit floors become irrelevant so the $\log_p(k)$ term is cancelled in (5), yielding the desired asymptotic.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
$\log_p\bra{\frac{\pi_p'(k)}{\pi_p(k)}} \sim k-\log_p(k)-\log_p\log_p(k)$
\label{54}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Note that
\[\frac{\pi'_p(k)}{\pi_p(k)} = p^{\#S_k},\]
where
\[S_k = \left\{i : i\le k, \frac{\pi_p(i)}{\pi_p(i-1)}\not \in p\mathbb{Z}\right\}.\]
The condition in $S_k$ can be re-written in terms of the p-adic valuation as $\nu_p(\pi_p(i)) = \nu_p(\pi_p(i-1))$. But this valuation is just $b_p([i])$, so we really have $\#S_k = k-b_p([k])$. Now we can write
\[\#S_k = k - \left\lceil \log_p \left( \Pi(k) \right)\right\rceil\]
where we already have an asymptotic formula for $\Pi(k)$. We can obtain
\[\#S_k \sim k - \log_p\left(\frac{p-1}{p}k\log_p(k)\right).\]
This implies that
\begin{align*}
\log_p \left( \frac{\pi'_p(k)}{\pi_p(k)} \right) &= \#S_k \\ 
&\sim k - \log_p\left(\frac{p-1}{p}k\log_p(k)\right).
\end{align*}
Ignoring constants in the above asymptotic, we obtain the desired asymptotic.
\end{proof}

By understanding $\pi_p$, we can easily derive formulas for $\pi'_p$ by simply accounting for a power of $p$ as above. That is,
\begin{align*}
\log_p \pi'_p(k) &\sim \log_p \pi_p(k) + k - \log_p(k) - \log_p \log_p(k)\\
&\sim \frac{\psi(k)}{\ln p}+k - \log_p(k),
\end{align*}
where we have already bounded $\pi_p$ via Theorem \ref{53}. The next task is to understand $\pi'_{p^e}(k)$. The lemma below yields an asymptotic estimate for $\log_p \pi'_{p^e}(k)$ through Theorem \ref{53} and Lemma \ref{54}.

\begin{lemma}
For prime powers of an odd prime, we have the formula 
\[\pi'_{p^e}(k) = p^{(k-1)(e-1)}\pi'_p(k). \tag{6}\]
For $p=2$, this is off by a constant factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ if $e>1$.
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} The idea behind this is to show $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j))\le 1$ for $j\ge 2$. This follows from $b_p([j+1])-b_p([j])\le 1$, so we prove this claim instead. Observe that $\Pi(j+1)-\Pi(j)\le j+1$. Let $p^i \le j$ be the largest prime power of $p$ less than or equal to $j$. But then 
\[\Pi(j+1) \le p^{b_p([j])} + j+1 \le p^{b_p([j])}+p^{i+1} \le p^{b_p([j])+1}.\]
Note that $b_p([j]) \ge i+1$, since $j\ge 2$ implies $\Pi(j)>p^i$. Then we conclude the final inequality from $p^{b_p([j])}+p^{i+1} = (1+p^{-\ell})p^{b_p([j])}$ for some $\ell \ge 0$, and $p\ge 1+p^{-\ell}$ as $p\ge 2$. It follows that $b_p([j+1])-b_p([j])\le 1$ and $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j))\le 1$ for $j\ge 2$.

Suppose we know $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j))\le 1$ at $j$. First consider the case when $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j)) = 1$. By definition 
\[\pi'_{p^e}(j+1) = \pi'_{p^e}(j) \lcm \left(p^e, \frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}\right)\]
since $\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j) = \pi_{p^e}(j+1)/\pi_{p^e}(j)$. In this case, to obtain $\pi'_{p^e}(j+1)$ we scale $\pi'_{p^e}(j)$ by $p^{e-1}$ in addition to scaling by $\frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}$. In the case where $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j)) = 0$, the very same reasoning shows we scale $\pi'_{p^e}(j)$ by $p^{e}$ in addition to scaling by $\frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}$. 

Using this, we can obtain the exact formula for $\pi'_{p^e}(k)$ recursively if we assume $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j))\le 1$ holds for $1\le j < k$ (we proved it for $j\ge 2$). In $k-1$ recursive steps, we arrive at $\pi'_{p^e}(1):=1$. Using the results above, we obtain 
\[\pi'_{p^e}(k) = \prod_{1\le j<k} p^{e-\nu_p\left(\frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}\right)} \frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}\]
by compactly summarizing the factors across the two cases $\nu_p\left(\frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}\right)=1$ and $0$. Since these are the only possibilities, when we pull out $p^{(e-1)(k-1)}$ we see that the factor which remains is $p^\ell (\prod_{1\le j < k}\frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)})$ where $\ell = \#\{j: 1\le j < k, \nu_p\left( \frac{\pi_p(j+1)}{\pi_p(j)}\right)=0\}$ is the number of times we have $p^e$ instead of $p^{e-1}$. Applying the same recursive computation in the $e=1$ case for $\pi'_p(k)$, this is $\pi'_p(k)$. Hence, assuming $\nu_p(\pi_p(j+1)/\pi_p(j))\le 1$ for all steps we obtain $\pi'_{p^e}(k) = p^{(k-1)(e-1)}\pi'_p(k)$.

For $p\neq 2$, we encounter no issues because we still have $\nu_p(\pi_p(2)/\pi_p(1))\le 1$, and so the exact formula holds. This is because $b_p([2])-b_p([1])=1-0=1$. For $p=2$ this does not hold, but our description of the recursive steps holds for all but the $j=1$ step where it is off by a constant factor, and so for $p=2$ the formula is off by a constant factor which is straighforward to compute.
\end{proof}

A useful consequence of this lemma is that
\[\nu_q(\pi'_{p^e}(k)) \sim \nu_q(p^{(k-1)(e-1)} \pi'_p(k))\]
for any prime $q$ since for odd primes these are equal and for $p=2$ they differ by a constant. Similarly, replacing $\nu_q$ with $\log_q$ or $\ln$ we have asymptotics for the logs.

We wish to use this result to understand the growth of $\ln \pi'_N(k)$. We can obtain a loose upper bound on $\ln \pi'_N(k) = \ln \lcm_{p\mid N}{\pi'_{p^{\nu_p(N)}}(k)}$ by taking the product of these asymptotics. However, we can do better. As $k\to \infty$, we simply need to identify which term has the largest power of $p$ associated to it for a given $p$. Set $\nu_q(N) = e_q$. For a prime $q\mid N$ not equal to $p$, we get \[\nu_p(\pi'_{q^{e_q}}(k)) \sim \nu_p\left(q^{(k-1)(e_q-1)} \pi'_q(k)\right)=\nu_p(\pi'_q(k)).\]
The last equality is because $\nu_p(q)=0$. We have $\nu_p(\pi'_q(k)) \sim \log_p(k)$ by Lemma \ref{52}. For $p$, we get
\[\nu_p\left(p^{(k-1)(e_p-1)}\pi'_p(k)\right)=\nu_p(\pi'_p(k)) + (k-1)(e_p-1).\]
Asymptotically, it is clear that this will quickly become dominant. We have
\[\nu_p \bra{\pi'_p(k)} \sim k-\log_p(k)-\log_p \log_p(k) + \log_p \Pi(k)\]
by Lemma \ref{54}, $\nu_p(\pi_p(k))=b_p([k])\sim \log_p \Pi_p(k)$, and that $\pi'_p(k)/\pi_p(k)$ is a power of $p$. Thus, using Lemma \ref{51} we see that only the $k$ is relevant for the asymptotic, so for $p\mid N$ we have $\nu_p(\pi'_N(k)) \sim \nu_p(\pi'_{p^{e_p}}(k)) \sim ke_p$. For primes $p\nmid N$, we get an overall contribution to $\ln \pi'_N(k)$ in the limit of $\ln(\lcm([k]))-\sum_{p \mid N}\ln k$, where the sum comes from Lemma \ref{52}. Putting these together, since the logs in the sum are dominated by other terms we have
\begin{align*}\ln \pi'_N(k) &\sim \sum_{p\mid N}{k e_p \ln p} + \psi(k) \\
&= k\ln N + \psi(k).
\end{align*}
Thus, we have proven the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
We have
\[\ln \pi'_N(k) \sim k\ln N + \psi(k).\]
\end{theorem}


\section{Conclusion and future directions}

We have shown that the function $f_{k}(n)$ is quasipolynomial modulo any $N \in \N$, from which an explicit formula for the generating function $F_{k}(x)$ follows. Additionally, the structure of the coefficients of $\qbinom{n}{k}$ has been described in terms of the sections $\mathsf{S}_i$ of that $q$-binomial coefficient, and the repeating period in each section has been shown to retain some of the properties of $\mathcal{S}$. 

A good future direction is to determine the minimal quasiperiod of $f_{k}(n)$. It is expected to lie somewhere between $\pi_N(k)$ and $\pi'_N(k)$ but it is unclear how the function actually behaves.

It is also interesting to investigate symmetry in the minimal period of the slopes of the functions $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ --- if we let this period be $P$, we mean to determine when the slope of $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(i)}$ matches that of $\mathcal{L}_{k}^{(P-i)}$ for $0\le i \le P$. Figure \ref{illustration} gives a counterexample (the slopes for $0\le i < 30$ are not symmetric in this way), but in many examples the pattern holds true.
