In this paper, we investigated the impact of workload dependent parameters on the failure ratio of the SSDs under power outage. To this end, we presented a fault injection and failure detection platform which injects the realistic power faults to the under test SSDs. During power failure, SSDs experience the exact voltage drop behavior that occurs during power failures in data centers. The results of our experiments reveal that the failure ratio in SSDs due to power outage is significantly affected by the parameters of the running workloads in the application layer. In addition, we show that failures in SSDs are not only due to volatile DRAM cache but also we observe similar failures in SSDs with disabled internal cache.
