\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
% 
We propose a novel soft-output joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) algorithm for multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.
%
Our algorithm approximately solves a maximum a-posteriori JED optimization problem using deep unfolding and generates soft-output information for the transmitted bits in every iteration. 
%
The parameters of the unfolded algorithm are computed by a hyper-network that is trained with a binary cross entropy (BCE) loss. 
%
We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in a coded MU-MIMO system with $\bf 8$ basestation antennas and $\bf 4$ user equipments and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms separate channel estimation from soft-output data detection. 
%
Our results demonstrate that our JED algorithm outperforms such data detectors with as few as 10 iterations.

\section{Conclusions}
  
We have proposed a novel soft-output joint channel estimation and data detection (S-JED) algorithm for MU-MIMO systems.
%
Our method formulates a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) optimization problem and computes approximate LLR values in every iteration. 
%
The algorithm parameters are generated by a hyper-network, which is trained using deep unfolding and a BCE cost function. 
%
Simulation results have shown that the proposed S-JED algorithm with only 10 iterations significantly outperforms the max-log optimal STS-SD and L-MMSE equalizer, which both separate channel estimation from soft-output data detection. 

There are many avenues for future work. Our future journal paper in~\cite{songSJEDfuture} will include missing derivations, a complexity comparison, and apply S-JED to higher-order modulation schemes as well as to other channel models.
