\section{Introduction}
%
In the uplink of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, where user equipments (UEs) transmit pilots and data to a base station (BS), deploying optimal joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) is an elusive goal, and has been practicable only for small-scale MIMO systems due to the combinatorial nature and the high-dimensionality of the JED problem~\cite{vikalo2006efficient,alshamary2015optimal,xu2008exact}.
%
To overcome the high complexity of such methods, references \cite{castanedaData2016,castaneda2017vlsi} proposed gradient-based algorithms that efficiently compute approximate solutions to the single-UE JED problem for large BS antenna arrays. 
%
The multi-UE JED case has been tackled recently in~\cite{songMinimizing2020} for cell-free massive MU-MIMO systems, also using a gradient-based algorithm. 
%
All of these methods compute hard-output estimates and are, thus, unable to realize the full potential of coded data transmission.
%
A soft-output algorithm that approximates JED using iterative estimation and detection (IED) has been proposed recently in \cite{heModeldriven2020}, which alternates between channel estimation and data detection. Similar alternating optimization methods have been used before for IED  in~\cite{Yilmaz19a,kofidis2017joint}. 

\subsection{Contributions}

With the recent progress in deep neural networks, optimal JED~\cite{vikalo2006efficient,alshamary2015optimal,xu2008exact} is suddenly within reach by leveraging deep unfolding of iterative algorithms \cite{hersheyDeep2014,balatsoukas-stimming19a,mongaAlgorithm2021,goutayDeep2020,heModeldriven2020}. 
%
In this paper, we propose a novel soft-output JED algorithm that  builds upon a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) JED problem formulation which we solve approximately using deep unfolding. 
%
We derive an iterative algorithm with soft-output capabilities by utilizing the approximate posterior mean estimator (PME) put forward in~\cite{jeonMismatched2020,jeon3542019}.
%
All algorithm parameters are generated by a hyper-network that processes estimated channel state information (CSI). The hyper-network is trained with a binary cross entropy (BCE) loss that exploits the soft-output capabilities of our JED algorithm.
%
We provide simulation results for an $8$ BS antenna, $4$ UE MU-MIMO system and compare our algorithm to state-of-the-art methods that separate channel estimation from soft-output data detection.

\subsection{Notation}
%
Lower case letters denote matrices and upper case boldface letters denote vectors. We use $ A_{b,u} $,  $\bma_u$, and $ b_k $ to represent the entry in the $ b $th row and $ u $th column of the matrix $ \bA $, the $u$th column of matrix $\bA$, and the $ k $th entry in the vector~$ \bmb $, respectively. 
%
The superscripts $^T $ and $^H$ denote the transpose and Hermitian transpose, respectively. The Frobenius norm and trace of a matrix $\bA$ is $ \normfro{\bA} $ and $\Tr(\bA)$. The $U\times U$ identity matrix is $\bI_U$. 
%
Sets are denoted by calligraphic letters and the cardinality of $\setQ$ is $|\setQ|$. The operator $\mathbb{E}$ denotes expectation.
