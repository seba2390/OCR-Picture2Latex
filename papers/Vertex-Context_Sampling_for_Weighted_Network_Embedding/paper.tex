\begin{abstract}

Network embedding methods have garnered increasing attention because of their effectiveness in various information retrieval tasks. The goal is to learn low-dimensional representations of vertexes in an information network and simultaneously capture and preserve the network structure. Critical to the performance of a network embedding method is how the edges/vertexes of the network is sampled for the learning process. Many existing methods adopt a uniform sampling method to reduce learning complexity, but when the network is non-uniform (\textit{i.e.} a weighted network) such uniform sampling incurs information loss. The goal of this paper is to present a generalized vertex sampling framework that works seamlessly with most existing network embedding methods to support weighted instead of uniform vertex/edge sampling. For efficiency, we propose a delicate sequential vertex-to-context graph data structure, such that sampling a training pair for learning takes only constant time. For scalability and memory efficiency, we design the graph data structure in a way that keeps space consumption low without requiring additional space. Moreover, the proposed framework can be used to implement extensions that feature high-order proximity modeling and weighted relation modeling. Experiments conducted on three datasets, including a commercial large-scale one, verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed weighted network embedding methods on various tasks, including word similarity search, multi-label classification, and item recommendation.


%This paper proposes a cost-effective sampling technique for unsupervised
%network embedding methods to work on a weighted network.
%The task of network embedding is to learn the low-dimensional representations
%of vertices in an information network; the objective of the learning is to
%capture and preserve the network structure in the representations.
%For learning the representations, the alias method, which is a
%sampling algorithm for discrete probability distribution, is usually used in
%traditional network embedding methods.
%However, without any well-designed data structure, simply using the alias
%method for the representation learning task is usually impracticable and will
%encounter several limitations, such as enormous memory consumption and
%insufficiency to deal with high-order or weighted relations among vertices in a
%network.
%In order to deal with the insufficiency problems, this paper proposes a
%delicate Vertex-Context data structure with the Alias (VCA) method; the VCA
%method provides a feasible way to sample high-order or weighted relations
%from non-uniform distributions in a constant time and simultaneously reduce the
%memory usage.
%By using the VCA sampling, our proposed network embedding method enables to
%mimic most existing models for various weighted networks.
%Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets, including one from a
%commercial music streaming company, verify the effectiveness and efficiency of
%the proposed VCA sampling for weighted network embedding on different tasks of
%word similarity search, multi-label classification, and recommendation.

%  Unsupervised network embedding methods have been attracting increasing attention
%  by their effectiveness.
