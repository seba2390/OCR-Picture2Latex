\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented an automated program repair approach for fixing memory safety issues guided by static analysis. In our workflow, static analysis is used to both discover and fix a bug, thus alleviating the classic over-fitting issue that test-based approaches normally suffer from. The approach is generic in that it does not require patch templates or bug specifications. To cope with the large search space such a generic method entails, we propose (i) effective patch space navigation by means of probabilistic context-free grammars or PCFGs,  and (ii) efficient patch validation by clustering patches into equivalence classes according to the \emph{effect} they have on the symbolic heap. 

The effect analysis on patches can be potentially extended to other use cases in the future, such as learning the effects of existing error handling routines in the program, which could help program repair/synthesis techniques to generate semantically correct error handling code.
