Dear Editor,

We are resubmitting a manuscript titled ``Learning fluid physics from highly turbulent data using sparse physics-informed discovery of empirical relations (SPIDER)" for consideration as a regular article in {\em Journal of Fluid Mechanics}. The manuscript has originally been submitted as a rapid (JFM-21-1506). We have substantially revised and extended the manuscript to address the comments provided by two referees. Our responses are included along with the revised version.

\closing{Sincerely,\\
