\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this work, we present our experience of pre-training knowledge graph to provide knowledge services for other tasks on the billion-scale e-commerce product knowledge graph. We propose Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Mode (PKGM) with two modules to handle triple queries and relation queries in vector space, which could provide  item knowledge services in a uniform way for embedding-based models without accessing triple data in KG. We also propose general ways of applying service vectors in different downstream task models. With three types of downstream tasks, we prove that PKGM successfully improves their performance. In future work, we would like to apply PKGM to more downstream tasks and explore other candidate ways to apply service vectors.
