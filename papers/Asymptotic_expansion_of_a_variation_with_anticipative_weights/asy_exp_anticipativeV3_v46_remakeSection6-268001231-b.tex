{\it Summary} \hspace{5pt}
Asymptotic expansion of a variation with anticipative weights is derived 
by the theory of asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals having a mixed normal limit. 
The expansion formula is expressed with the quasi-torsion, quasi-tangent and other random symbols. 
To specify these random symbols, 
it is necessary to classify the level of the effect of each term appearing in 
the stochastic expansion of the variable in question.  
%since the expression of random symbols becomes fairly complicated. 
To solve this problem, we consider a class $\call$ of certain sequences $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ of Wiener functionals 
and we give a systematic way of estimation of the order of $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$. % in $\call$. 
Based on this method, we introduce a notion of {\it exponent} of 
the sequence $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$, and 
investigate the stability and contraction effect of the operators $D_{u_n}$ and $D$ on $\call$, 
{\sred where $u_n$ is the integrand of a Skorohod integral.} 
After constructed these machineries, we derive asymptotic expansion of the variation having 
anticipative weights. An application to robust volatility estimation is mentioned.

\section{Introduction}
Let $\bbW=\{\bbW(h)\}_{h\in\mH}$ be an isonormal Gaussian process on a real separable Hilbert space $\mH$ 
with inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$. 
That is, $\bbW$ is a system of centered Gaussian variables on a probability space 
$(\Omega,\calf,P)$ with 
\bea\label{202003130048} 
E\big[\bbW(h_1)\bbW(h_2)\big] &=& \langle h_1,h_2\rangle
\eea
for $h_1,h_2\in\mH$. 
Then we have the Malliavin derivative $D$ and the divergence operator $\delta$, i.e., 
the adjoint operator $D^*$ of $D$. The Sobolev space with differentiability index $s$ 
and integrability index $p$ is denoted by $\bbD^{s,p}$. 
The $q$-fold multiple Wiener integral is denoted by $I_q(f)=\delta^k(f)$ for $f\in\mH^{\odot q}$, 
the space of symmetric elements of $\mH^{\otimes q}$. 
For the Malliavin calculus, we refer the reader to 
Watanabe \cite{watanabe1984lectures}. %, Watanabe1983}, 
Ikeda and Watanabe \cite{IkedaWatanabe1989} and 
Nualart \cite{Nualart2006}. 
Nourdin and Pecati \cite{nourdin2012normal} is an excellent exposition of applications 
of the Malliavin calculus to central limit theorems by Stein's method. 



In this paper, we are specially interested in asymptotic expansion of a variation of a Wiener process 
with random weights. This problem is {\sred deeply} related to the expansion of 
the power variation of a diffusion process time-discretely observed; 
see Podolskij and Yoshida \cite{podolskij2016edgeworth} and Podolskij et al. \cite{podolskij2017edgeworth}. 
%
In what follows, we suppose that $\mH=L^2({\colorr \bbR_+})$, the $L^2$-space of 
$\bbR$-valued functions on ${\sred\bbR_+=[0,\infty)}$, and that 
\beas 
%E\big[\bbW(h_1)\bbW(h_2)\big] \yeq 
\langle h_1,h_2\rangle &=& \int_0^{{\colorr\infty}} h_1(t) h_2(t) dt
\eeas
for $h_1,h_2\in\mH$. 
Let $w_t=\bbW(1_{[0,t]})$ for $t\in{\sred\bbR_+}$. %[0,1]$. 
Then process $w=(w_t)_{t\in{\sred\bbR_+}}$ is a one-dimensional standard Wiener process. 

Let $t_j=t^n_j=j/n$ $(j=0,1,...,n)$ and let denote by $1_j$ the indicator function 
$1_{I_j}$, $I_j=[\tjm,\tj]$. 
%
{\colorb Suppose that $\calq$ is a finite subset of $\{2,3,4,....\}$. 
Let us consider the variation
\bea\label{202004021410}
V_n
&=&
\sum_{q\in\calq}
n^{2^{-1}(q-1)}\sum_{j=1}^na_j(q) I_q(1_j^{\otimes q})
\eea
with random weights $a_j(q)=a_j^n(q)$ depending on $j\in\bbJ_n=\{1,...,n\}$ and $n\in\bbN$. 
The weight $a_j(q)$ is not necessarily predictable with respect to the Brownian filtration. 
}

%satisfying $2\in\calq$. 
%Let $\calq$ be a finite subset of $2\bbN$, positive even numbers, and suppose that $2\in\calq$. 
For each $q\in\calq$, we consider an $\mH$-valued functional
\bea\label{202003130046}
u_n &=& \sum_{q\in\calq}u_n(q)
\eea
given by
\bea\label{202003130047}
u_n(q)
&=& 
n^{-1/2}\sum_{j=1}^n a_j(q) I_{q-1}((n^{1/2}1_j)^{\otimes(q-1)})n^{1/2}1_j 
\nn\\&=& 
n^{2^{-1}(q-1)}\sum_{j=1}^na_j(q) I_{q-1}(1_j^{\otimes (q-1)})1_j. 
\eea
%with random variables $a_j(q)=a_j^n(q)$ depending on $j\in\bbJ_n=\{1,...,n\}$ and $n\in\bbN$. 
For example, $a_j(q)=a_q(w_\tj,w_{1-\tj})$ for a function $a_q$ and a Wiener process $w$, 
however we will treat more general functionals $a_j(q)$.

Suppose for the meantime that 
\beas%\label{0112121022}
a_j(q)\in\bbD^{1,2+}=\cup_{p>2}\bbD^{1,p}
\quad (j\in\bbJ_n;\>q\in\calq)

\eea
\end{en-text}

%
In particular $u_n(q)\in \text{Dom}(\delta)$ and 
\bea\label{0112121101}
M_n
&:=&
\delta(u_n)
\eea
is well defined and in $L^2$. 
Equivalently, 
\bea\label{202003171321} 
M_n &=& \sum_{q\in\calq}M_n(q)
\eea
where
\bea\label{202003181159} 
M_n(q) &=& \delta(u_n(q))
\nn\\&=&
n^{2^{-1}(q-1)}\sum_{j=1}^na_j(q) I_q(1_j^{\otimes q})
-n^{2^{-1}(q-1)}\sum_{j=1}^n(D_{1_j}a_j(q) )I_{q-1}(1_j^{\otimes (q-1)})
\eea
Here $D_{1_j}a_j(q)=\langle Da_j(q),1_j\rangle$. 
%

Consider a sequence of random variables 
\bea\label{202003130001}
Z_n &=& M_n+n^{-1/2}N_n\quad(n\in\bbN)
\eea
where $(N_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is a sequence of random variables. 
%It will be assumed that 
Variable $N_n$ is of order one and satisfying some regularity conditions, 
as specified more clearly later. 
%$(r_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is a sequence of positive numbers such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n=0$. 
Therefore $Z_n$ is a perturbation of $M_n$ by $n^{-1/2}N_n$. 
{\colorb In particular, $V_n$ is an example of $Z_n$ if one sets 
\bea\label{202004151750} 
\sum_{q\in\calq}n^{q/2}\sum_{j=1}^n(D_{1_j}a_j(q) )I_{q-1}(1_j^{\otimes (q-1)})
\eea
to $N_n$. 
}\noindent
The variable $Z_n$ of the form (\ref{202003130001}) is standard in analysis of 
the variation of a process driven by $w$ and statistics for volatility as well.

Statistics appearing here is the so-called non-ergodic statistics, 
where the limit distribution of $M_n$ 
is typically a mixed normal distribution. 
In the statistical context, the Fisher information becomes random even in the limit, and 
it causes a variance mixture of normal distributions. 
In Section \ref{202003141649}, we will provide asymptotic expansion of the distribution of $(V_n,X_\infty)$ 
for a reference variable $X_\infty$. 
%A special feature is asymptotic mixed normality of $M_n$ as $n\to\infty$, in other words, statistics becomes non-ergodic. 
Section \ref{202004021507} treats the general functional $Z_n$ of (\ref{202003130001}) without the specific expression (\ref{202004151750}) for $N_n$, and derives asymptotic expansion of 
the joint distribution of $(Z_n,X_n)$ for a sequence of reference variables $X_n$. 

Asymptotic expansion for a sequence of random variables asymptotically having 
a mixed normal distribution was derived in Yoshida \cite{yoshida2013martingale} 
for continuous martingales 
by introducing the notion of random symbols 
called {\it adaptive random symbol} for {\it tangent} 
and {\it anticipative random symbol} for {\it torsion}, and applied to 
the power variation by Podolskij and Yoshida \cite{podolskij2016edgeworth}, 
the quadratic variation under microstructure noise by 
Podolskij et al. \cite{podolskij2017edgeworth}, and to 
a precise error estimate for the Euler-Maruyama scheme 
by Podolskij et al. \cite{podolskij2018edgeworthToappear}. %{podolskij2018edgeworth}. 
Even if one starts with the martingale framework, asymptotic expansion is not closed in it, 
and the Malliavin derivative appears in the anticipative random symbol. 
Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} introduced 
new random symbols called {\it quasi-tangent} ({\it q-tangent}) and {\it quasi-torsion} ({\it q-torsion}), 
%the counterparts of the adaptive random symbol for tangent and the anticipative random symbol for torsion, 
and provided 
asymptotic expansion of the Skorohod integral with these random symbols.\footnote{We remark that the correspondence between the two pairs of random symbols 
is not one to one. In particular, the quasi-tangent does not correspond to the tangent 
expressed by the adaptive random symbol. }
They applied this scheme to some examples including a randomly weighted 
quadratic form of the increments of a fractional Brownian motion. 
Section \ref{202003141634} recalls the theory of asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals. 


As summarized in Section \ref{202003141634},  
%for the general $Z_n$ of (\ref{202003130001}) without the specific expression (\ref{202004151750}) for $N_n$, 
it is necessary to identify each limit of the q-tangent and the q-torsion 
for deriving the asymptotic expansion formula. 
%They applied this scheme to some examples including a randomly weighted quadratic form of the increments of a fractional Brownian motion. 
When we apply the theory to $V_n$, 
it is not easy to distinguish the effect of each term in the limit since 
the expression of random symbols becomes fairly complicated, and 
really it is more difficult 
for $M_n$ of (\ref{0112121101}) than the quadratic form treated 
in Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic}. 
%
To solve this problem, we consider a class $\call$ of sequences $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ of Wiener functionals; 
the definition of $\call$ is in Section \ref{202004270705}. 
%
In Section \ref{202003141640}, we present estimates to $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ in $\call$ 
in order to make the classifications easier in derivation of the expansion formula. 
The author hopes this section is of interest even apart from asymptotic expansion. 
%
Based on the estimate in Section \ref{202003141640}, 
we introduce a notion of {\it exponent} of 
the sequence $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ in Section \ref{202004270637}, and 
investigate the effect of the operators $D_{u_n(q)}$ and $D$ 
%to $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$. 
{\sred applied} on $\call$. 
%
Section \ref{202003141657} gives a proof to the results in Section \ref{202003141649} 
%by using the estimates given in Section \ref{202003141640} to apply 
by applying 
the theory of asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals recalled in Section \ref{202003141634}, while 
Section \ref{202004270654} validates the results in Section \ref{202004021507}. 
Our results are general. There are many applications though we only mention two examples in 
Sections \ref{202005180614} and \ref{202004261806}. 
The latter section treats asymptotic expansion for an anticipative functional 
appearing in robust volatility estimation. 

Concluding Introduction, we mention developments 
of the theory of asymptotic expansion (Edgeworth expansion) 
in the central limit cases, listing 
some basic literature in the early days (because giving a complete list in a paragraph is impossible) 
to guide the reader to the history of asymptotic expansion and to indicate where we are now. 
When the limit of a sequence of random variables is exactly Gaussian, 
as it is ordinarily true under a sufficiently fast mixing property, %effective ergodic property, 
asymptotic expansion was proved 
%for mixing processes and martingales:  
in various scenarios.

Bhattacharya and Ghosh \cite{BhattacharyaGhosh1978} among huge historical literature 
for independent observations. 
Asymptotic expansion has been established as a basic tool supporting the modern statistical theory. 
%
Higher-order asymptotic theory cannot exist without asymptotic expansion: 
Akahira and Takeuchi \cite{AkahiraTakeuchi1981}, Pfanzagl \cite{Pfanzagl1985} and Ghosh \cite{Ghosh1994}.  
%if we list some of literature in the early days. 
%
Historically, 
multivariate analysis is one of the fields where asymptotic expansion techniques have been well developed 
(Okamoto \cite{okamoto1963asymptotic}). 
Informative textbooks for asymptotic expansion in the 
multivariate analysis are 
Anderson \cite{anderson1962introduction} and 
Fujikoshi, Ulyanov and Shimizu \cite{fujikoshi2011multivariate}. 
%
Theory of Bootstrap methods (Efron \cite{efron1979bootstrap}) 
has a theoretical basis on asymptotic expansion (Hall \cite{Hall1992}). 
%
The reader is referred to 
Barndorff-Nielsen \cite{barndorff2012parametric}, 
Jensen \cite{jensen1995saddlepoint} and 
Pace and Salvan \cite{PaceSalvan1997} 
for saddle-point approximations. 
%
Combining asymptotic expansion with the notion of the $\alpha$-connection, 
information geometry 
gave an interpretation of the higher-order efficiency of estimation  
in terms of the curvature of the fibre associated with the estimator (Amari \cite{Amari1985}). 
%
Asymptotic expansion was also applied to construction of information criteria for 
model selection as well as prediction problems; 
e.g., Konishi and Kitagawa \cite{KonishiKitagawa1996}, 
Uchida and Yoshida \cite{UchidaYoshida2001,UchidaYoshida2004}, Komaki \cite{Komaki1996}. 
Bhattacharya et al. \cite{bhattacharya2016course} is an excellent textbook including 
a concise exposition of asymptotic expansion. 
%
Dependent cases were studied by 
G\"otze and Hipp \cite{GotzeHipp1983, GotzeHipp1994} for (approximate) Markov chains having a mixing property. 
It should be commented that in this short paragraph, we can not list a large number of studies behind the epoch-making paper by G\"otze and Hipp \cite{GotzeHipp1983}, but 
a few related papers to be mentioned are 
Nagaev \cite{nagaev1957some} and Tikhomirov \cite{tikhomirov1981convergence},  
and Lahiri \cite{lahiri1996asymptotic} after \cite{GotzeHipp1983}. 
Specialized treatments are possible for Gaussian processes (Taniguchi \cite{Taniguchi1991}). 
%
With stochastic analysis, asymptotic expansion was studied 
by Kusuoka and Yoshida \cite{KusuokaYoshida2000} and Yoshida \cite{Yoshida2004} 
for continuous-time mixing Markov processes, and by Mykland \cite{Mykland1992,Mykland1993} and 
Yoshida \cite{Yoshida1997, yoshida2001malliavin} for martingales 
{\sred about moments and distributions, respectively.} 
%
The martingale expansion with mixed normal limit distribution (Yoshida \cite{yoshida2013martingale}) 
has been applied to power variations and the Euler-Maruyama approximation 
of a stochastic differential equation, as already mentioned. 
The Malliavin calculus played an essential role in the above studies 
\cite{Yoshida1997, yoshida2001malliavin, KusuokaYoshida2000, Yoshida2004,yoshida2013martingale}. 
%
Asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel was an important application of the Malliavin calculus 
(Watanabe \cite{Watanabe1987}, Ikeda and Watanabe \cite{IkedaWatanabe1989}), though 
purely distributional treatment is not necessary, differently from the limit theorems we are now aiming at. 
%
In statistics and finance, asymptotic expansion has various applications 
even if limited to the objects in stochastic analysis: 
for example, 
Yoshida \cite{Yoshida1992, Yoshida1993, Yoshida1996a, yoshida2003conditional} 
based on the Watanabe theory \cite{Watanabe1987} in the Malliavin calculus, 
Dermoune and Kutoyants \cite{DermouneKutoyants1995}, Kutoyants \cite{Kutoyants2004, Kutoyants1998}, 
Sakamoto and Yoshida \cite{
SakamotoYoshida1996, 
SakamotoYoshida1998a, 
SakamotoYoshida2003, 
SakamotoYoshida2004, 
%SakamotoYoshida2008, 
SakamotoYoshida2009, 
SakamotoYoshida2010} together with an application 
(Sakamoto et al. \cite{sakamoto2004expansions}) 
to an inadmissibility problem (Stein's phenomenon), 
Masuda and Yoshida \cite{
%MasudaYoshida2004, 
MasudaYoshida2005}, 
Kutoyants and Yoshida \cite{KutoyantsYoshida2007}, 
Dalalyan and Yoshida \cite{DalalyanYoshida2011}, 
Li \cite{li2013maximum} 
in statistics for stochastic processes, 
and in finance 
Yoshida \cite{Yoshida1992a}, 
Kunitomo and Takahashi \cite{KunitomoTakahashi2001}, 
Takahashi and Yoshida \cite{TakahashiYoshida2004, TakahashiYoshida2005}, 
Uchida and Yoshida \cite{UchidaYoshida2004b}, 
Li \cite{li2014closed, li2016estimating} and Cai et al. \cite{cai2014closed} 
for option pricing among plenty of %following 
literature; 
a related paper is Hayashi and Ishikawa \cite{hayashi2012composition}. 
YUIMA has implemented asymptotic expansion techniques 
for automatic fast computation of the expectation of a generic functional defined 
by a system of stochastic differential equations 
(\cite{Yuima2014}, \cite{iacus2017simulation}). 
%A related paper is Hayashi and Ishikawa \cite{hayashi2012composition}. 
%
We refer the reader to Yoshida \cite{yoshida2016asymptotic} for a short exposition of  
asymptotic expansion and additional references therein. 
%
Today asymptotic expansion has been motivated once again 
in the surge of studies on central limit theorems for Wiener functionals after the forth moment theorem 
(Nualart and Peccati \cite{nualart2005central}). 
%
Tudor and Yoshida \cite{tudor2019asymptotic} provided 
asymptotic expansion for general Wiener functionals. 
Arbitrary order of asymptotic expansion for Wiener functionals was obtained by 
Tudor and Yoshida \cite{tudor2019high} in the ergodic case and applied to a stochastic wave equation. 
{\sred This scheme was also applied to a mixed fractional Brownian motion 
in Tudor and Yoshida \cite{tudor2020asymptotic}.} 
Yoshida \cite{yoshida2013martingale} and Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} derived asymptotic expansion having a mixed normal limit. 
The last paper is the starting point of this article. 



\section{Asymptotic expansion of {\colorb$V_n$} %$M_n$
}\label{202003141649}
{\colorb
We will present asymptotic expansion to the joint law $\call\{(V_n,X_\infty)\}$ 
for $V_n$ defined in (\ref{202004021410}) and a reference variable $X_\infty$. 
The random asymptotic variance of $V_n$ is an example of $X_\infty$ but 
a generic variable $X_\infty$ will be treated. 
In this section, we give priority to simplicity of presentation though 
we can generalize the results in this section by replacing $X_\infty$ 
by a sequence of variables $X_n$ ($n\in\bbN$), as will do 
it for $Z_n$ of (\ref{202003130001}) with a generic $N_n$ together with $X_n$ 
in Section \ref{202004021507}.

\subsection{Asymptotic expansion of $E[f(V_n,X_\infty)]$ for a smooth function $f$}
The following set of conditions is concerning certain regularity of $a_j(q)$ 
and limits of some related variables, in particular, it involves $a(t,q)$ for $(t,q)\in[0,1]\times\calq$. 
%Recall that $a_j(q)$ depends on $n$. 
We will write 
\bea\label{202004201141}
G_\infty &=& \sum_{q\in\calq}q! \int_0^1 a(t,q)^2dt.
\eea
To write the asymptotic expansion formula, we use measurable random fields 
$(a(t,q))_{t\in[0,1]}$, $(\dota(t,s,q))_{(t,s)\in[0,1]^2}$, 
$(\dot{a}(t,2))_{t\in[0,1]}$ (if $2\in\calq$), 
%$(\ddot{a}(t,s,q,q'))_{(t,s)\in[0,1]^2}$ 
$(\ddota(t,s,q))_{(t,s)\in[0,1]^2}$

In statistics of volatility, special interest is in even polynomials of the increments of the process, 
i.e., the case $\calq\subset2\bbN$. 
However, we will treat a more general case where 
\bea\label{202004111810}
\calq\cap(\calq+1) &=& \phi, 
\eea
in other words, 
\beas
\min\{|q_1-q_2|;\>q_1,q_2\in\calq,\>q_1\not=q_2\}\geq2.
\eeas
This condition is satisfied when one considers a variation with an even power, e.g. 
The Hermite power variation with anticipative weights is a simple example of the case $\#\calq=1$, that satisfies 
(\ref{202004111810}). 
It is possible to remove Condition (\ref{202004111810}) but we do not pursue it here because 
the results and the presentation will be much more complicated.

\end{theorem}


\begin{remark}\rm 
Theorem \ref{0112121225} gives stable convergence of $V_n$ to $G_\infty^{1/2}\zeta$, in particular. 
Of course, it is possible to reduce the conditions for the asymptotic expansion 
only to prove the stable convergence, but it is an exercise and so details are omitted.

\subsection{Expansion of $E[f(V_n,X_\infty)]$ for a measurable function $f$}
If $(V_n,X_\infty)$ is asymptotically non-degenerate in Malliavin's sense, 
the differentiability of $f$ can be removed. 
Application of the Malliavin calculus to the non-degeneracy issue 
requires more smoothness of functionals. 
We say $U_n=O_{\bbD^\infty}(b_n)$ as $n\to\infty$ for 
a sequence of variables $U_n$ and a sequence of positive numbers $b_n$ 
if $\|U_n\|_{s,p}=O(b_n)$ as $n\to\infty$ 
for all $(s,p)\in\bbR\times(1,\infty)$. 
For a multi-dimensional differentiable functional $F=(F^i)_{i=1,...,\bar{i}}$, we write 
$\Delta_F=\det(\langle DF^{i_1},DF^{i_2}\rangle)_{i_1,i_2=1,...,\bar{i}}$.

Condition (\ref{2020041446}) is realistic. An example will be given in Section \ref{202004201231}. 

For a polynomial random symbol $\varsigma(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx)=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx)^\alpha$, 
where each $c_\alpha$ is a random variable and the multi-index $\alpha$ is in $\bbZ_+^2$, 
the expected action of the adjoint  $\varsigma(\partial_z,\partial_x)^*$ 
to $\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\delta_x(X_\infty)$ is defined by 
\bea\label{202004171910}
E\bigg[\varsigma(\partial_z,\partial_x)^*\bigg\{\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\delta_x(X_\infty)\bigg\}\bigg]
&=& 
\sum_\alpha(-\partial_z,-\partial_x)^\alpha 
E\bigg[c_\alpha\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\delta_x(X_\infty)\bigg]
\nn\\&=&
\sum_\alpha(-\partial_z,-\partial_x)^\alpha 
\bigg\{E\big[c_\alpha\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\big|X_\infty=x\big]p^{X_\infty}(x)\bigg\}
\nn\\&&
\eea
Here $\delta_x(X_\infty)$ is Watanabe's delta function, that is, 
the pull-back of the delta function $\delta_x$ by $X_\infty$, 
that is a generalized Wiener functional in ${\widetilde{\bbD}}^{-\infty}=\cup_{s\in\bbR}\cap_{p>1}\bbD^{s,p}$, suppose that $X_\infty$ is non-degenerate in Malliavin's sense, as well as 
smoothness of functionals appearing. 
$p^{X_\infty}(x)$ is a good version of density function of the distribution $\call\{X_\infty\}$. 
It and its continuous derivatives exist so that the differentiations in (\ref{202004171910}) make 
the ordinary sense. 
See Section \ref{202005171900}. 

Define the (polynomial) random symbol $\mathfrak{S}_n$ by 
\beas 
\mathfrak{S}_n
&=&
1+n^{-1/2}\mathfrak{S}, 
\eeas
where the random symbol $\mathfrak{S}$ is given in (\ref{202004161621})
for Theorem \ref{202004171845} forthcoming. 
%
The asymptotic expansion formula is expressed by the density 
\bea\label{202004191710} 
p_n(z,x) &=& 
E\bigg[\mathfrak{S}_n(\partial_z,\partial_x)^*
\bigg\{\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\delta_x(X_\infty)\bigg\}\bigg]. 
\eea
The density function $p_n$ is well defined under Condition $[A^\sharp]$. 




Let $\cale(M,\gamma)$ denote the set of measurable functions 
$f:\bbR^2\to\bbR$ satisfying 
$|f(z,x)|\leq M(1+|z|+|x|)^\gamma$ for all $(z,x)\in\bbR^2$. 
%
\begin{theorem}\label{202004171845}
Suppose that Condition $[A^\sharp]$ is satisfied. Then 
\beas
\sup_{f\in\cale(M,\gamma)}
\bigg| E\big[f(V_n,X_\infty)\big] 
-\int_{\bbR^2}f(z,x)p_n(z,x)dzdx\bigg|
&=& 
o(r_n)
\eeas
as $n\to\infty$ for every $(M,\gamma)\in(0,\infty)^2$. 
Here the density $p_n(z,x)$ is defined by (\ref{202004191710}) 
for the random symbol $\mathfrak{S}$ given in (\ref{202004161621}). 
\end{theorem}

Proof of Theorem \ref{202004171845} is in Section \ref{202004171914}. 
In Theorems \ref{0112121225} and \ref{202004171845}, 
$N_n$ and $X_n$ were specific. 
We will generalize them in Section \ref{202004021507} after clarifying what kind conditions 
should be posed by the general theory recalled in Section \ref{202003141634}. 


\section{Basic results in asymptotic expansion}


\subsection{Donsker-Watanabe's delta function}\label{202005171900}
Denote by $\cals(\bbR^\sfd)$ the space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions on $\bbR^\sfd$. 
The dual of $\cals(\bbR^\sfd)$ is the space of Schwartz distributions and denoted by $\cals'(\bbR^\sfd)$. 
Let $A=1+|x|^2-\half\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian on $\bbR^\sfd$. 
Define the norm $\|u\|_{2k}=\sup_{x\in\bbR\sfd}|A^ku(x)|$ for $u\in\cals(\bbR^\sfd)$ and 
$k\in\bbZ$. 
For negative $k$, $A^k$ is well defined as an integral operator. 

Denote $\hat{C}(\bbR^\sfd)$ the space of continuous functions $g$ on $\bbR^\sfd$ 
such that $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}g(x)=0$. 
The spadce $\hat{C}(\bbR^\sfd)$ is equipped with the sup-norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$. 
For $m\in\bbZ_+$, defined $\hat{C}^{-2m}(\bbR^\sfd)$ by 
\beas 
\hat{C}^{-2m}(\bbR^\sfd) &=& 
\big\{g\in\cals'(\bbR^\sfd);\>A^{-m}g\in\hat{C}(\bbR^\sfd)\big\}. 
\eeas
For $g\in\hat{C}^{-2m}(\bbR^\sfd)$, we defined $\|g\|_{-2m}$ by 
\beas 
\|g\|_{-2m} &=& \|A^{-m}g\|_\infty. 
\eeas
By the representation theorem of $\cals'(\bbR^\sfd)$, we know 
\beas 
\cals'(\bbR^\sfd) &=& \bigcup_{m\in\bbZ_+}\hat{C}^{-2m}(\bbR^\sfd). 
\eeas
More precisely, 
every $g\in\cals'(\bbR^\sfd)$ has a representation 
\beas 
g(x) &=& (1+|x|^2)^{s/2}\partial^\alpha f(x)
\eeas
for some $\alpha\in\bbZ_+^\sfd$, $s\geq0$ and some bounded measurable function $f$, 
where the partial derivatives is in the sense of the generalized derivatives. 
Then $\partial^\nu A^{-m}\partial^\lambda g \in \hat{C}(\bbR^\sfd)$ whenever 
$2m>|\nu|+|\lambda|+|\alpha|+s$. 
Moreover, 
\beas 
\|\partial^\nu A^{-m}\partial^\lambda g\|_\infty &\leq & C \|f\|_\infty
\eeas
for some constant $C$ depending on $m$, $|\nu|$, $|\lambda|$, $|\alpha|$, $s$ and $\sfd$, 
but independent of $f$. 
%
In the case of the Dirac delta function $\delta_a$ on $\bbR^\sfd$, 
\beas 
\partial_x^{\bf n}\delta_a(x) &\in& \hat{C}^{-2m}(\bbR^\sfd)
\eeas
for $m\in\bbZ_P$ satisfying $m>(|\n|+\sfd)/2$. 
%
Therefore, 
$\partial_x^{\n}\delta_a(F)$ is well defined for $F\in\bbD^{2m+1,\infty}(\bbR^\sfd)$ 
and $m>(|\n|+\sfd)/2$ if $\Delta_F^{-1}\in L^\inftym$. 
The composite functional $\partial_a^{\n}\delta_a(F)$ requires the same regularity. 
%
In this paper, we use $\delta_x(X_\infty)$ and its derivatives of limited order. 
For example, the differentiability requested to $X_\infty$ in Condition $[C]$ 
in Section \ref{202003141634} is sufficient for the use.

it is known that 
\beas 
\cals'(\bbR^\sfd) &=& \bigcup_{k\in\bbZ}C_{2k}.

\subsection{Asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals}\label{202003141634}
This section overviews the machinery given by Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} 
for asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals, 
and extends their results {\sred by a perturbation method}. % to the ones that are useful in applications. 
Since there are many other applications than this paper gives 
and the {\sred extension is} general, in this section, we keep the multi-dimensional setting 
in \cite{nualart2019asymptotic}. 
In this section, we do not need the structure of the Hilbert space for a standard Brownian motion. 
So we will work on a probability space $(\Omega,\calf,P)$ equipped with an isonormal Gaussian process 
$\bbW=\{W(h)\}_{h\in\mH}$ on a real separable Hilbert space $\mH$ having an inner product 
$\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ and the norm $|\cdot|_\mH=\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle^{1/2}$. 
%

We will consider a sequence of $\sfd$-dimensional random variables $Z_n$ having a decomposition
\bea\label{202003291147}
Z_n &=& M_n+r_nN_n
\eea
where 
$M_n=\delta(u_n)=\big(\delta(u_n^i)\big)_{i=1,...,\sfd}$ is the Skorohod integral 
for {\sred a} %some 
generic $u_n=(u_n^i)_{i=1,...,\sfd}\in{\mathcal Dom}(\delta)^\sfd$, 
$N_n$ is a $\sfd$-dimensional random variable and 
$(r_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is a sequence of positive numbers such that $\lim_{n\to\infty}r_n=0$. 
{\sred Later,} we will set $r_n=n^{-1/2}$ as in (\ref{202003130001}), 
when using the asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals to the applications of this paper. 
%
%In what follows, we will only treat one-dimensional variables for notational simplicity though the scheme in Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} applies to multidimensional variables. 
A reference variable will be denoted by a $\sfd_1$-dimensional random variable $X_n$. 
Our interest is in deriving asymptotic expansion for the joint distribution $\call\{(Z_n,X_n)\}$. 
To be considered here is the situation where $M_n\to^dG_\infty^{1/2}\zeta$ 
as $n\to\infty$, where $G_\infty$ is a $\sfd\times\sfd$ positive symmetric random matrix 
and $\zeta$ is a $\sfd$-dimensional standard normal random vector independent of $G_\infty$ and possibly defined on an extension of $(\Omega,\calf,P)$. 
See Nourdin, Nualart and Pecati \cite{nourdin2016quantitative} for 
the stable limit theorems on the Wiener space. 

The $r$ times tensor product of a vector $v$ is denoted by $v^{\otimes r}$. 
For a tensor $T=(T_{i_1,..,i_k})_{i_1,...,i_k}$ and vectors 
$v_1=(v^{i_1}_1)_{i_1}$,...,$v_k=(v_k^{i_k})_{i_k}$, we write 
\beas 
T[v_1,...,v_k] 
&=& 
T[v_1\otimes\cdots \otimes v_k]
\yeq
\sum_{i_1,...,i_k}T_{i_1,...,i_k}v^{i_1}_1\cdots v_k^{i_k}. 
\eeas
The brackets $[\ ]$ stands for a multilinear mapping. 
For $\mH$-valued tensors $S=(S_i)$ and $T=(T_j)$, 
the tensor with components $(\langle S_i,T_j\rangle)_{i,j}$ is denoted by $\langle S,T\rangle$. 
This rule is {\sred also} applied to {\sred tensor-valued} %random 
tensors. 
The Malliavin derivative of a matrix-valued functional $F=(F^{ij})$ is denoted by $DF$. 


Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} defined three random symbols analogous to the adaptive random symbol (tangent) and the anticipative random symbol (torsion) introduced in Yoshida \cite{yoshida2013martingale}, though these two sets of random symbols are not corresponding one-to-one. 
%
The {\bf quasi-tangent}  (q-tangent) is defined by 
%%
\begin{en-text}
\beas 
{\sf qTan}(\tti\sfz)^2
&=& 
%r_n^{-1}\big(D_{u_n}M_n(\tti\sfz)^2-G_\infty(\tti\sfz)^2\big). 
r_n^{-1}\big(D_{u_n\tti\sfz}M_n\tti\sfz-G_\infty(\tti\sfz)^2\big). 
\eeas
\end{en-text}
%%
\beas 
{\sf qTan}[{\cred\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2}]&=&
r_n^{-1}\bigg(\big\langle DM_n[\tti{\cred\sfz_1}],u_n[\tti\sfz_2]\big\rangle
-G_\infty[\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2]\bigg)
\eeas
for $(\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2)\in
(\tti\bbR^{\sfd})^2$. 
%
%
The {\bf quasi-torsion} (q-torsion) and {\bf modified quasi-torsion} (modified q-torsion) are defined by 
%%
\begin{en-text}
\beas
{\sf qTor}(\tti\sfz)^3
&=& 
r_n^{-1}D_{u_n\tti\sfz}D_{u_n\tti\sfz}M_n\tti\sfz%(\tti\sfz)^3

\eeas
and 
\beas
{\sf mqTor}[{\cred\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2,\tti\sfz_3}]&=&
r_n^{-1}\big\langle DG_\infty[{\cred\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2}],u_n[\tti{\cred\sfz_3}]\big\rangle
\eeas
for $(\tti\sfz_1,\tti\sfz_2,\tti\sfz_3)\in(\tti\bbR^{\sfd})^3$, respectively. 
%\noindent{\colorr when $u_n\in\bbD^{3,p}(\mfh\otimes\bbR^\sfd)$

r_n^{-1}D_{u_n\tti\sfz}G_\infty(\tti\sfz)^2,
\eeas
respectively. 
\end{en-text}
%%
%
These random symbols are well defined under suitable differentiability of variables. 
%
They are related by the formula
\beas 
\big\langle D\>{\sf qTan}[(\tti\sfz)^{\otimes2}],u_n[\tti\sfz]\big\rangle_\mfh 
&=& 
{\sf qTor}[(\tti\sfz)^{\otimes3}]-{\sf mqTor}[(\tti\sfz)^{\otimes3}], 
\eeas
or symbolically, 
\beas 
D_{u_n}{\sf qTan} &=& {\sf qTor}-{\sf mqTor}. 
\eeas
%
{\sred We could} replace $D_{{\sred u_n}}M_n=\big\langle DM_n,u_n\big\rangle$ by its symmetric version 
\beas 
\half\big(
\big\langle DM_n,u_n\big\rangle+\big\langle u_n, DM_n\big\rangle\big)
\eeas
{\sred when defining ${\sf qTan}$, but we go with the above definition.} 

When $(Z_n,X_n)\to^d(G_\infty^{1/2}\zeta,X_\infty)$ as $n\to\infty$, 
we have 
\bea\label{202013291441}
E\big[f(Z_n,X_n)\big] - E\big[f(G_\infty^{1/2}\zeta,X_\infty)\big] &=& o(1)
\eea
as $n\to\infty$ for any bounded continuous function 
$f:\bbR^{{\sred\check{\sfd}}}\to\bbR$, {\sred$\check{\sfd}=\sfd+\sfd_1$,} 
by definition of the convergence 
in distribution. 
Asymptotic expansion gives more precise approximation to $E\big[f(Z_n,X_n)\big]$ than 
(\ref{202013291441}) as 
\bea\label{202013291445}
E\big[f(Z_n,X_n)\big] - E\big[f(G_\infty^{1/2}\zeta,X_\infty)\big]
-r_n\bbL(f) &=& o(r_n), 
\eea
where $\bbL(f)$ is a linear functional of $f$. 
The approximation (\ref{202013291445}) holds for smooth function $f$ in general. 
However, if the distribution $\call\{(Z_n,X_n)\}$ is regular to some extent, then 
(\ref{202013291445}) is valid for non-differentiable functions $f$, and moreover 
uniformly in $f$ in a certain class of measurable functions. 
%To validate (\ref{202013291445}) in such a case, 
Then the notion of {\it local density} is necessary and a truncation technique will be required 
to carry out the validation. 
For this purpose, we introduce a random variable $\psi_n:\Omega\to[0,1]$ depending on $n\in\bbN$. 

Write $\dotx_n=r_n^{-1}(X_n-X_\infty)$, 
\beas 
G^{(2)}_n &=& r_n{\sf qTan}\yeq D_{u_n}M_n-G_\infty
\eeas

Here we are assuming that each $\mathfrak{T}$ is a random polynomial of $(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx)$ 
with integrable coefficients. 
The convergence in (iii) of Condition $[B]$ does not necessarily mean 
the $L^1$-convergence of the random symbol $\mathfrak{T}_n$ to $\mathfrak{T}$. 
It only requires ``weak'' convergence in that the projection of $\mathfrak{T}_n$ onto $\Psi$
converges to that of $\mathfrak{T}$ onto $\Psi$. 
Indeed, the degree of the random polynomial $\mathfrak{T}$ may differ from that of $\mathfrak{T}_n$.

Denote by $\beta_0$ the degree in $(\sfz,\sfx)$ of the random symbol $\mathfrak{S}$. 
Let $\beta=\max\{7,\beta_0\}$. 
Now Theorem 3.3 of Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} is rephrased 
by the following theorem. 
%
\begin{theorem}\label{202004011550}
Suppose that Condition $[B]$ is satisfied. 
Then 
\beas 
\sup_{f\in \calb}\bigg|
E\big[f(Z_n,X_n)\big] - 
\bigg\{E\big[f(G_\infty^{1/2}\zeta,X_\infty)\big]

for any bounded set $\calb$ in $C^{\beta+1}_b(\bbR^{\sred\check{\sfd}})$, 
where $\zeta\sim N_{\sred\sfd}(0,{\sred I_\sfd})$ independent of $\calf$. 
\end{theorem}

The role of $\psi_n$ is implicit in Theorem \ref{202004011550}. 
Simplification by setting $\psi_n=1$ is obvious if the other conditions are satisfied. 
However, the truncation functional $\psi_n$ is indispensable when 
asymptotic expansion of $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ for measurable functions $f$, as discussed below. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Asymptotic expansion of $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ is possible for measurable functions 
if the law $\call\{(Z_n,X_n)\}$ is sufficiently regular. 
In the present context, it is natural to asses the regularity 
by the local non-degeneracy of the Malliavin covariance of the variables in question. 
Here we recall a set of conditions among others considered in 
Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic}. 
It involves a parameter $\ell{\sred =\check{\sfd}+8}$ concerning differentiability. 
%In the present situation $\ell=10$. 
%, while we keep the symbol $\ell$ to clarify the dependency of each condition on it. 
We denote by $\beta_x$ the maximum degree in $x$ of $\mathfrak{S}$. 
%Let $d_2=(3+\beta_x)\vee\big(2+2\lfloor(\beta_x+1)/2\rfloor\big)$. 
Let $d_2={\sred(\ell+\beta_x-7)\vee\big(2\lfloor(\sfd_1+2)/2\rfloor}
+2\lfloor(\beta_x+1)/2\rfloor\big)$. 
Let $\bbD^{s,\infty}=\cap_{p>1}\bbD^{s,p}$. 
For a multi-dimensional functional $F$, we write $\Delta_F=\det\sigma_{F}$, 
$\sigma_F$ being the Malliavin covariance matrix of $F$. 
The following condition rephrases Condition $[C^\natural]$ of Section 7 
of Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic}.

makes a suitable truncation functional $\psi_n$, 
though we just mention it here; %do not explain more about it in this paper; 
see Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} for details of a construction of $\psi_n$. 
The truncation method is essential because $(M_n,X_\infty)$ is not necessarily 
uniformly non-degenerate, but locally asymptotically non-degenerate. 
In statistics, variables are not always defined as a smooth Wiener functional, 
and then there is no way the uniform non-degeneracy can be obtained. 
Condition $[C]$ is much stronger than Condition $[B]$ {\sred even} with $\psi_n=1$.

\section{Generalization%Asymptotic expansion of $(Z_n,X_n)$
}\label{202004021507}
We will consider the variable $Z_n$ having the expression (\ref{202003130001}). 
The functional $M_n$ is defined by (\ref{0112121101}) with the kernel $u_n$  
given by (\ref{202003130046}) and (\ref{202003130047}). 
The principal part $M_n$ of $Z_n$ is the same as before, 
however, 
\underline{the variables $N_n$ and $X_n$ {\sred ($n\in\bbN$)} are general} in this section. 
We do not assume $N_n$ is specified by (\ref{202004151750}). 
Such a generalization is motivated by asymptotic expansion of a parametric estimator 
for a stochastic differential equation, 
for example, where $N_n$ involves derivatives (with respect to the statistical parameter) 
of the quasi-log likelihood function of the model and is 
utterly different from and more complicated than (\ref{202004151750}). 
%see Yoshida 
{\sred 
A multi-dimensional extension is straightforward but we will only consider 
one-dimensional variables for notational simplicity. 
}

A sufficient condition for asymptotic expansion of the joint distribution $\call\{(Z_n,X_n)\}$ 
will be in part similar to the one presented in the general theory in Section \ref{202003141634} 
since we do not assume any specific form of $N_n$ or $X_n$. 
We keep $G_\infty$ defined by (\ref{202004201141}) as well as 
measurable random fields 
$(a(t,q))_{t\in[0,1]}$, $(\dota(t,s,q))_{(t,s)\in[0,1]^2}$, 
$(\dot{a}(t,2))_{t\in[0,1]}$ (if $2\in\calq$)

The random symbol ${\mathfrak S}_n$ is defined by (\ref{202004211634})

We consider the asymptotic expansion formula (\ref{202004211625})

This function is well defined under Condition $[D^\sharp]$. 
The error of the asymptotic expansion of $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ for a measurable function $f$

Theorem \ref{202004211628} can provide an asymptotic expansion formula of $\call\{Z_n\}$ 
without a reference variable $X_n$. 
Indeed, even when $X_n$ is not given, we can apply Theorem \ref{202004211628} 
to the joint distribution $\call\{(Z_n,X_\infty)\}$ by adding an independent variable $X_n=X_\infty\sim N(0,1)$ 
and extending the Malliavin calculus for $Z_n$ to incorporate $X_\infty$. 
Though this is a possible way, reconstruction of the proof without $X_n$ 
has a merit that it reduces the differentiability index. 
So we directly apply Theorem 7.7 of Nualart and Yoshida \cite{nualart2019asymptotic} 
to the case without the reference variable $X_n$ nor $X_\infty$. 
Let $\widehat{\Psi}(\sfz)=\exp(2^{-1}G_\infty(\tti\sfz)^2)$ for $\sfz\in\bbR$.

\section{An example}\label{202005180614}
We will consider an example in this section. 
For a Wiener process $w=(w_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$ realized by an isonormal Gaussian process over 
a real separable Hilbert space $\mH$. 
We will consider a quadratic variation with anticipative weights 
\beas 
\V_n &=& \sum_{j=1}^na(w_{1-\tj})(\Delta_jw)^2
\eeas
where $a\in C^\infty_p(\bbR)$ and $\tj=j/n$. 
%
Let us simply denote $f_t=f(w_t)$ as before. 
%
It is easy to see 
\beas 
\V_n &\to^p& \V_\infty
\eeas
as $n\to\infty$ for  
$\V_\infty = \int_0^1 a_{1-t}dt$. 
%
Let $Z_n= \sqrt{n}(V_n-V_\infty)$. Then 
\beas 
Z_n&:=&\sqrt{N}\big(\V_n-\V_\infty \big)
\yeq 
M_n+n^{-1/2}N_n
\eeas
where 
$M_n =\delta(u_n)$ for 
\bea\label{202005180753}
u_n &=& n^{1/2}\sum_{j=1}^na_{1-\tj}I_1(1_j)1_j
\eea
and 
\bea\label{202005181317}
N_n 
&=& 
n\sum_{j=1}^n(D_{1_j}a_{1-\tj})I_1(1_j)+n\sum_{j=1}^n
\int_{{\sred \tjm}}^{{\sred \tj}}(a_{1-\tj}-a_{1-t})dt
\nn\\&=:&
N_n^{(1)}+N_n^{(2)}.
\eea
%
This $Z_n$ is an example of that in (\ref{202003130001}) if one sets 
$\calq=\{2\}$ and $a_j(2)=a_{1-\tj}$. 
For a reference variable, we shall consider $X_\infty=w_1$. 
Therefore the asymptotic expansion of the joint law $\call\{(Z_n,X_\infty)\}$ 
is given by Theorem \ref{202004211628}. 

We will verify Condition $[D^\sharp]$. 
Condition $[A]$ (\ref{ai}) is obvious. 
For 
\beas 
a(s,2)=a_{1-s},
\eeas 
Condition $[A]$ (\ref{aiii}) holds. 
%
Since 
\beas 
D_{1_k}a_{1-\tj} &=& a'(w_{1-\tj})n^{-1}1_{\{t_k\leq 1-t_j\}},
\eeas
Condition $[A]$ (\ref{aiv}) is satisfied with 
\beas
\dota(t,s,2)=a'(w_{1-s})1_{\{t\leq 1-s\}}, 
\eeas
and Condition $[A]$ (\ref{av}) with
\beas 
\dot{a}(t,2)=a'(w_{1-t})1_{\{t\leq 1/2\}}.
\eeas
%
We have 
\beas 
D_{1_k}D_{1_k}a(w_{1-\tj}) 
&=& 
a''(w_{1-\tj})n^{-2}1_{\{t_k\leq 1-\tj\}}
\eeas
and hence Condition $[A]$ (\ref{avi}) is satisfied by
\beas 
\ddota(t,s,2) 
&=& 
a''(w_{1-s})1_{\{t\leq 1-s\}}.
\eeas
%
Condition $[A]$ (\ref{aix}) is met for $X_\infty=w_1$ and $\ddot{X}_\infty(t)=0$. 
%

In the present situation.  
\beas
G_\infty 
&=& 
2\int_0^1a_{1-s}^2ds\yeq 2\int_0^1 a_s^2ds. 
\eeas
Then Condition $[A^\sharp]$ (\ref{aviii}$^\sharp$) is satisfied. 
In fact, Section \ref{202004201231} shows (\ref{2020041446}). 
%
We assume that $G_\infty^{-1}\in L^\inftym$. Then 
Condition $[A^\sharp]$ (II) is fulfilled. 
%
Condition $[D^\sharp]$ (i$^{\sf x}$) is easy to check. 

The variable $X_\infty=w_1$ satisfies the conditions in $[D^\sharp]$ (II) concerning it, so we verify it for $N_n$. 
{\sred According to Section \ref{202004270705},} 
the exponent of the first component of (\ref{202005181317}) is 
$e\big(N_n^{(1)}\big)=0$, 
which means $N_n^{(1)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(1)$. 
Moreover, 
Proposition \ref{202004091035} applied to $N_n^{(1)}$ represented by (\ref{202005181317}) 
ensures $D_{u_n}N_n^{(1)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1/2})$, and hence $D_{u_n}^2N_n^{(1)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1/2})$. Thus $N_n^{(1)}$ satisfies the related part of Condition $[D^\sharp]$ (II). 

For $N_n^{(2)}$, we have 
\beas 
N_n^{(2)}
&=&
%n\sum_{j=1}^n\int_{I_j}(a_{1-\tj}-a_{1-t})dt
%\nn\\&=&
-n\sum_{j=1}^n\int_\tjm^\tj(a_t-a_\tjm)dt
\eeas
%
Let 
\beas 
A_n(j;x) &=& -\int_0^1a'\big(w_x+v(w_x-w_\tjm)\big)dv.
\eeas
for $x\in\bbT$, the one-dimensional torus identified with $[0,1]$, 
and let 
\beas 
\dot{\bbH}_n^{(0)}(x)
&=&
n\sum_{j=1}^n A_n(j;x)I_1\big(1_{[\tjm,x]}1_j(x)\big)
\eeas
%
Then 
\beas
N_n^{(2)}
&=&
\int_\bbT\dot{\bbH}_n^{(0)}(x)dx,
\eeas
where $dx$ is the Haar measure on the compact group $\bbT$ compatible with the Lebesgue measure. 
%
The functional ${\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH}}_n(\mbx)$ of (\ref{202005190511}) is 
\beas 
{\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH^{(0)}_n}}(x)
&=& 
n\sum_{j=1}^n A_n(j;\tjm+x)I_1\big(1_{[\tjm,\tjm+x]}1_j(\tjm+x)\big).
\eeas
for $\dot{\bbH}_n^{(0)}(x)$. 
The exponent 
\beas 
e\bigg({\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH^{(0)}_n}}(x)\bigg)
&=&
1
\eeas
and hence 
\beas 
{\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH^{(0)}_n}}(x)
&=& 
O_{\bbD^\infty}(n)
\eeas
uniformly in $x\in\bbT$ because this estimate follows from Theorem \ref{0110221242}. 
Therefore we obtain 
\beas 
N_n^{(2)} &=& O_{L^\inftym}(1)
\eeas
by Theorem \ref{202005190527} applied to the case where 
\beas
e^{(1)}_{n,j}(x)
&=& 
I_1\big(1_{[\tjm,x]}1_j(x)\big)
\yeq 
I_1\big(1_{[\tjm,x]}1_1(x-\tjm)\big)1_{[0,n^{-1}]}(x-\tjm),
\\
g^{(1)}_{n,j} &=& -\tjm,
\\
\chi^{(1)}_n &=& [0,n^{-1}].
\eeas
%
The $i$-th derivative $D^iN_n^{(2)}$ can be estimated in a similar manner. 
Indeed, from (\ref{202005190606}), 
%%
\begin{en-text}
\beas 
D^i_{\mbv}N_n^{(2)}
&=&
\int_\bbT D^i_{|v|_{\mH^{\otimes i}}^{-1}\mbv}\>
{\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH^{(0)}_n}}(x)1_{[0,n^{-1}]}(x)
dx\>|v|_{\mH^{\otimes i}}

for $i\in\bbZ_+$. 
%

We obtained the estimate $N_n^{(2)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(1)$ as $n\to\infty$.

Operating $D_{u_n}$ to (\ref{202005190625}) in $i=0$, we have

\bigg\|D^iD_{u_n}{\stackrel{\circ}{\bbH^{(0)}_n}}(x)\bigg\|_p

%
Combining this and the representation (\ref{202005190639}), we conclude 
$D_{u_n}N_n^{(2)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5})$. 
We can also say $D_{u_n}^kN_n^{(2)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5})$ for $k\geq1$ 
since $u_n=O_{\bbD^\infty}(1)$. 
%
Thus, the part concerning $N_n^{(2)}$ in $[D^\sharp]$ (II) has been verified. 
$[D^\sharp]$ (II) has been checked. 
In particular, $D_{u_n}N_n=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5})$.

\section{%An example: 
Robust realized volatility}\label{202004261806}
Robustness is an established notion in statistics 
(Huber \cite{huber2004robust}, Hampel et al. \cite{hampel2011robust}). 
According to the concept of robust statistics, 
the most effective part of the estimator should be removed or diminished to attain robustness  
because that part is most sensitive to contamination of the data. 
In volatility estimation, it is known that the realized volatility is weak against jumps, and 
multi-power variations and 
(predictable) thresholding methods for example have been studied to approach this issue. 
Recently, Inatsugu and Yoshida \cite{inatsugu2018global} proposed 
global jump filters to realize robust estimation for volatility of an It\^o process. 
For correct rejection of contaminated observations, their filters use a selector depending on the whole data. 
The resulting estimator obviously destroys the martingale structure, 
however resists jumps well, especially consecutive jumps, for which 
traditional methods like by-power variation do not work. 
Related to such construction, we will consider another type of robust variation with a global filter 
and investigate asymptotic expansion as an example of our scheme. 


Consider a unique strong solution $X=(X_t)_{t\in\bbR_+}$ to the stochastic differential equation 
\beas 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ccl}
dX_t &=& \sigma(X_t)dw_t+b(X_t)dt,\quad t\in\bbR_+\\
X_0 &=& x_0.
\end{array}
\right.
\eeas
Here $w=(w_t)$ is a Brownian motion, 
$x_0\in\bbR$, $\sigma,b\in C^\infty$ and we suppose 
every positive order of derivative of $\sigma$ and $b$ is bounded. 
The uniform nondegeneracy $\inf_x\sigma(x)>0$ is assumed. 

The most popular volatility estimator in finance is 
the realized volatility $U_n$ defined by 
\beas 
U_n  &=& \sum_{j=1}^n(\Delta_jX)^2
\eeas
on the interval $[0,1]$, where $\Delta_jX=X_\tj-X_\tjm$ with $\tj=j/n$. 
It is well known that $U_n$ is sensitive to jumps. 
%
A robust variation of the realized volatility we will consider is 
\bea\label{202005041049}
\bbV_n &=& \sum_{j=1}^n\Phi\left(U_n,L_{n,j}\right)(\Delta_jX)^2
\eea
where $\Phi\in C^\infty_p(\bbR^2)$, the space of smooth functions with derivatives of at most polynomial growth.  
%
The functional $L_{n,j}$ is defined by 
\beas 
L_{n,j} &=& {\colorb \eta_{n,j}^{-1}}\sum_{{\colorb k\in K_j}}(\Delta_kX)^2
\eeas
{\colorb with 
$
\eta_{n,j}= \# K_j/n
$, 
where 
\beas 
K_j &=& K_{n,j} \yeq \big\{k\in\bbN;\> 
\underline{K}_j\leq k\leq \ol{K}_j\big\}
\eeas
and 
\beas 
\underline{K}_j\yeq\underline{K}_{n,j}\yeq( j-\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor+1)\vee 1,
&&
\ol{K}_j\yeq\ol{K}_{n,j}\yeq(j+\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor-1)\wedge n
\eeas
{\sred for the locality parameter $\lambda\in(0,1)$}. 
}
%

An example of robust volatility measures is  
\beas 
\bbV_n^* &=& \sum_{j=1}^n\varphi\left(U_n^{-1}L_{n,j}\right)(\Delta_jX)^2
\eeas
where $\varphi\in C_b^\infty(\bbR)$, the space of smooth bounded functions having bounded derivatives. 
%
The statistic $\bbV_n^*$ selects increments $\Delta_jX$ according to 
the relative magnitude $L_{n,j}$ of the local volatility to the estimated average spot volatility. 
%
For example, $\varphi$ is a smooth function taking $1$ in $\{x;|x|\leq C\}$ and 
$0$ in $\{x;|x|\geq C\}$ for some positive constant $C$. 
Then, especially when ${\sred \lambda}$ is small, an increment $\Delta_jX$ will be removed from the sum 
if an increment in either $[\tjm,\tj]$ or intervals% just after 
{\sred near around} 
is contaminated with a jump. 
%
Let $\psi:\bbR_+\to[0,1]$ be a smooth function such that $\psi(x)=1$ for $x\in[0,1/c_0]$ and 
$\psi(x)=0$ for $x\in[2/c_0,\infty)$ for $c_0=\inf_{x\in\bbR}\sigma(x)^2/2$. 
%
Then it is easy to see the asymptotic expansion of $\bbV_n^*$ coincides with that of 
\beas 
\bbV_n^{**} &=& \sum_{j=1}^n\psi(U_n^{-1})\varphi\left(U_n^{-1}L_{n,j}\right)(\Delta_jX)^2
\eeas
The statistic $\bbV_n^{**}$ is exactly an example of $\bbV_n$ 
for $\Phi(x,y)=\psi(|x|^{-1})\varphi(|x|^{-1}|y|)$. 

There is no mathematical difficulty even if 
%one filters the increments on $[t_{k-1},t_k]$ for $k$ such that $j-\lfloor n\eta\rfloor\leq k \leq j+\lfloor n\eta\rfloor$ e.g., 
one adopts {\sred various local estimators} %another filter 
but we consider $L_{n,j}$ for notational simplicity. 
{\sred Indeed,} 
as for $U_n$, it was possible to choose a multi-power variation or another global volatility estimator. 

Simply denote $f_t=f(X_t)$ for a function $f$. 
Let 
\beas 
U_\infty \yeq \int_0^1 \sigma_t^2dt,&& 
{\colorb 
L_{\infty,t}\yeq \eta_{\infty,t}^{-1}\int_{(t-\lambda)\vee0}^{(t+\lambda)\wedge1}\sigma_s^2ds

\subsection{Stochastic expansion of the error}
We introduce some systematic notation. 
We write 
$b^{[1]}=\sigma$ and $b^{[2]}=b$. 
For a $C^2$ function $f$, denote 
$f^{[1]}=\sigma f' = b^{[1]}f'$, $f^{[2]}=\half \sigma^2 f''+bf'=\half (b^{[1]})^2f''+b^{[2]}f'$. 
It\^o's formula is then written by 
\beas 
f_t=f_s+\int_s^t f^{[1]}_rdw_r+\int_s^t f^{[2]}_rdr
\eeas
for $t>s\geq0$. 
For $b^{[1]}=\sigma$ and $b^{[2]}=b$, 
define $b^{[i_1,i_2,...,i_m]}$ inductively by 
\beas 
b^{[i_1,i_2,...,i_m]} &=& \big(b^{[i_1,i_2,...,i_{m-1}]}\big)^{[i_m]}
\eeas
for $i_1,...,i_m\in\{1,2\}$, $m\geq2$.

Proof of Lemma \ref{202005051550} is in Section \ref{202005141700}. 
%

\subsection{Asymptotic expansion of $Z_n$}
We can now apply the results in Section \ref{202004021507}. 
However, the asymptotic expansion term $N_n$ consists of two terms of different nature. 
Because of this, it is {\sred useful} to treat them in different ways. 
%
%We are on the point of checking the conditions to applying the results presented in Section \ref{202004021507}. 
%
Based on the stochastic expansion (\ref{202005050001}), 
we consider the following decomposition of $Z_n$: 
\bea\label{202005120237}
Z_n &=& Z_n^{\sf o} +n^{-1/2}N_n^{\sf x}, 
\eea

%
We will apply the results in Section \ref{202004021507} to $Z_n^{\sf o}$ of (\ref{202005120238}) 
to obtain asymptotic expansion for the law $\call\{(Z_n^{\sf o},X_1)\}$. 
Then the variable $Z_n$ is a perturbation of $Z_n^{\sf o}$ by ${\sred n^{-1/2}}N_n^{\sf x}$, as in (\ref{202005120237}). 
To incorporate the effect of $N_n^{\sf x}$, the perturbation method will be used. 


Among several possible exposition, we only give a result on the asymptotic expansion for a measurable function $f$ 
in the existence of the reference variable $X_1$ though the situation can be easily generalized. 
A non-degeneracy condition for $G_\infty$ will be assumed because it can degenerate in general. 
%We did not exclude e.g. $\Phi(x,y)=1/x$ so far. 
On the other hand, the non-degeneracy of $X_1$ is quite standard. 
Proof of the following theorem is in Section \ref{202005141659}.
%
\begin{theorem}\label{202005110453}
Suppose that $G_\infty^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{X_1}^{-1}$ are in $L^\inftym$. Then 
there exists a (polynomial) random symbol ${\mathfrak A}(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx)$ 
with coefficients in $\bbD^\infty$ 
such that 
\beas\label{202005141414}
\sup_{f\in\cale(M,\gamma)}
\bigg| E\big[f(Z_n,X_1)\big] 
-\int_{\bbR^2}f(z,x){\mathfrak p}_n(z,x)dzdx\bigg|
&=& 
o(r_n)
\eeas
as $n\to\infty$ for every $(M,\gamma)\in(0,\infty)^2$, 
where 
\beas
{\mathfrak p}_n(z,x) &=& 
E\bigg[\mathfrak{A}_n(\partial_z,\partial_x)^*
\bigg\{\phi(z;0,G_\infty)\delta_x(X_1)\bigg\}\bigg]. 
\eeas
and 
\beas 
{\mathfrak A}_n(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx)
&=& 
1+n^{-1/2}{\mathfrak A}(\tti\sfz,\tti\sfx). 
\eeas
An expression of ${\mathfrak A}$ is presented in Section \ref{2020051437}.

\subsection{Exponent of a functional}\label{202004270705}

%the effect of the action of the projector $D_{u_n}$ on 
the functional $\cali_n$ defined by% \koko{\colorr extend the notion to $f_j$}

\sum_{j_1,...,j_m=1}^nA_n(j_1,...,j_m)
%I_{q_1}(1_{j_1}^{\otimes q_1})\cdots I_{q_m}(1_{j_m}^{\otimes q_m})
I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})
\eea
where $n\in\bbN$, $\alpha\in\bbR$, $m\in\bbN$ and $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbZ^m$. 
%
Suppose that 
$f_{j_i}^{(i)}=f_{j_i}^{(i),n}\in\mH^{\tilde{\otimes}q_j}$ such that 
$\text{supp}(f_{j_i}^{(i)})\subset I_{j_i}^{\>q_i}$ and that

\sup_{t_1,...,t_{q_i}\in[0,{\sred1}]}|f_{j_i}^{(i)}(t_1,...,t_{q_i})|&\leq&C_1
\eea
for some finite constant $C_1$. 
%
The following condition will be assumed for the coefficients $A_n(j_1,...,j_m)$ in this section. 
We are writing $\bbJ_n=\{1,...,n\}$. 
%
\bd\im[[S\!\!]] \label{202005131639}
$A_n(j_1,...,j_m)\in\bbD^\infty$ for all $j_1,...,j_m\in\bbJ_n$, $n\in\bbN$, and 
\beas

\eeas
for every $i\in\bbZ_+$ and $p>1$.  
\ed
%


Let $\bar{q}(m)=q_1+\cdots+q_m$. 
For $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbZ^m$, define $\sfm_1(q_1,...,q_m)$ and $\sfm_0(q_1,...,q_m)$ by 
\beas 
\sfm_1(q_1,...,q_m) \yeq \#\big\{m'\in\{1,...,m\};\>q_{m'}>0\big\}
&\text{and}& 
\sfm_0(q_1,...,q_m) \yeq \#\big\{m'\in\{1,...,m\};\>q_{m'}=0\big\},
\eeas
respecrively. 
%
We define {\it the exponent} $e(\cali_n)$ of $\cali_n$ admitting an expression (\ref{202004051400}) by 
\beas 
 e(\cali_n) 
 &=& 
\alpha-\half \bigg(\bar{q}(m)- \sfm_1(q_1,...,q_m)\bigg)
+\sfm_0(q_1,...,q_m)-\infty1_{\{\min\{q_1,...,q_m\}<0\}}
\\&=&
\alpha-\half \bar{q}(m)+m-\half\sfm_1(q_1,...,q_m)-\infty1_{\{\min\{q_1,...,q_m\}<0\}}.
\eeas
The exponent is defined for the sequence $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$; 
in this sense, it is 
more rigorous to write $e((\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN})$ for $e(\cali_n)$, but we adopt simpler notation. 
For example, 
$
e(\cali_n) = 0
$
for $\cali_n$ admitting the representation (\ref{202004051400}) 
if $\alpha=2^{-1}(\bar{q}(m)-m)$ and $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbN^m$. 
The exponent $e(\cali_n)$ depends on an expression (\ref{202004251257}) of $\cali_n$. 
Often we will not write explicitly which expression is considered when writing an exponent 
if there is no fear of confusion. 
Theorem \ref{0110221242} ensures 
\bea\label{202004051415}
\cali_n &=& O_{L^\inftym}(n^{e(\cali_n)})
\eea
as $n\to\infty$ under $[S]$ 
if $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbZ_+^m$. 
In fact, 
if $q_1,...,q_k>0=q_{k+1}=\cdots=q_m$, for example, then 
\beas 
\|\cali_n\|_p 
&\leq&
n^\alpha\sum_{j_{k+1},...,j_m}
\bigg\|\sum_{j_1,...,j_k}
A_n(j_1,...,j_m)
%I_{q_1}(1_{j_1}^{\otimes q_1})\cdots I_{q_m}(1_{j_k}^{\otimes q_k})
I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})
\bigg\|_p
\\&\leq&
n^{\alpha+(m-k)-2^{-1}(q_1+\cdots+q_k-k)}
\\&=&
O(n^{e(\cali_n)})
\eeas
for $p>1$. If $(q_1,...,q_m)$ involves a negative component, then 
$e(\cali_n)=-\infty$ and (\ref{202004051415}) is valid in the sense that 
\beas 
0 &=& O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-\infty}). 
\eeas
Thus, (\ref{202004051415}) holds for all $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbZ^m$. 

Let $\cals$ be the set of sequences $(\cali_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ 
such that each $\cali_n$ admits a representation {\sred (\ref{202004251257})} 
for some $\alpha\in\bbR$, 
$m\in\bbN$ and $(q_1,..,q_m)\in\bbZ^m$ (independent of $n$) 
and 
coefficients $A_n(j_1,...,j_m)$ satisfying $[S]$. 
Let $\call$ be the linear space generated by all finite linear combination of elements of $\cals$. 
For $\calj_n\in\call$, we define the exponent $e(\calj_n)$ of $\calj_n$ by 
the maximum exponent of the summands in $\calj_n$. 
We remark that each summand of $\calj_n$ has a specific representation to determine its exponent, 
and hence $e(\calj_n)$ depends on these representations.
Furthermore, we define the exponent $e(\calk_n)$ 
by 
\beas 
e(\calk_n)&=&\max_{i=1,...,\bar{i}}e(\calj_n^{(i)})
\eeas
for a sequence $(\calk_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ of variables that satisfies 
\beas 
|\calk_n|\leq\sum_{i=1}^{\bar{i}}|\calj_n^{(i)}|
\eeas 
for some sequences $(\calj_n^{(i)})_{n\in\bbN}\in\call$, $i\in\{1,...,\bar{i}\}$. 
The exponent $e(\calk_n)$ depends on the dominating sequences $(\calj_n^{(i)})_{n\in\bbN,\>i\in\{1,...,{\bar{i}}\}}$ 
and their representation. 
The set of such sequences $(\calk_n)_{n\in\bbN}$ is denoted by $\calm$. 
By definition, 
\bea\label{202004121326}
\calk_n &=& O_{L^\inftym}(n^{e(\calk_n)})
\eea
for $(\calk_n)_{n\in\bbN}\in\calm$.

\subsection{Operator $D_{u_n(q)}$}
We are interested in the effect of the action of the projector $D_{u_n}$ on the functional $\cali_n$. 
Though the following argument is easily applied to more general functions $f_j$ but 
we will specially pay attention to $\cali_n$ re-defined by %\koko{\colorr extend the notion to $f_j$}
\bea\label{202004051400}

\eea
where $n\in\bbN$, $\alpha\in\bbR$, $m\in\bbN$ and $(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbZ^m$. 
By convention,
\beas 
I_{q}(1_j^{\otimes q}) 
&=&
\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
1&(q=0)\y
0&(q<0)
\end{array}\right.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the present problem, the product formula has the expression 
\bea\label{202003151619} 
I_{q_1}(1_j^{\otimes(q_1)}) I_{q_2}(1_j^{\otimes(q_2)}) \cdots I_{q_\mu}(1_j^{\otimes(q_\mu)})
&=&
\sum_{\nu\in\bbZ_+}c_\nu(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)
I_{\sum_{i=1}^\mu q_i-2\nu}\big(1_j^{\otimes(\sum_{i=1}^\mu q_i-2\nu)}\big)n^{-\nu}

\eea
for some constants $c_\nu(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)$ depending on $\nu\in\bbZ_+$ 
and $(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)\in\bbZ_+^\mu$. 
%Remark that {\colorr$I_0(1_j^{\otimes0})=1$} by convention. 
The function $(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)\mapsto c_\nu(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)$ is symmetric, and 
may take $0$; e.g., 
$c_\nu(q_1,q_2,...,q_\mu)=0$ whenever $\sum_{i=1}^\mu q_i-2\nu<0$. 
We have 
\beas 
c_\nu(q_1,q_2) &=& c_\nu(q_1,q_2,0)\yeq
1_{\{0\leq\nu\leq (q_1\wedge q_2)\}}\nu!

\nn\\&&
\eea
for $q_1,q_2,q_3\in\bbZ_+$ (it is easy to verify that this three-factor product formula is valid for indices 
possibly being $0$). 
Let $c_x=0$ when $x\not\in\bbZ$. 


If $c_\nu(q_1,q_2,q_3)\not=0$ for $\nu=\bar{q}(3)/2$, then 
$\bar{q}(3)$ is even and 
\bea\label{202004111043}
\nu\yeq \frac{q_1+q_2+q_3}{2} \leq \min\{(q_1+\nu_1),(q_2+q_3-\nu_1)\}
\eea
for some $\nu_1$ such that 
\bea\label{202004111045}
0\leq\nu_1\leq\min\{q_2,q_3\}.
\eea
Remark that if $(a+b)/2\leq\min\{a,b\}$ for two real numbers $a$ and $b$, then $a=b=(a+b)/2$. 
Therefore, 
\bea\label{202004111046} 
q_1+\nu_1\yeq q_2+q_3-\nu_1\yeq \frac{q_1+q_2+q_3}{2}, 
\eea
which implies 
\bea\label{202004111044}
\nu_1=\frac{-q_1+q_2+q_3}{2}.
\eea
From (\ref{202004111045}) and (\ref{202004111046}), we obtain 
\bea\label{202004111047}
q_1\yleq q_2+q_3,\quad q_2\yleq q_1+q_3,\quad q_3\yleq q_1+q_2. 
\eea
Let $\bbT$ be the set of $(q_1,q_2,q_3)\in\bbZ_+^3$ satisfying  
the ``triangular condition'' (\ref{202004111047}). 
For $\nu=\bar{q}(3)$ and $\nu_1$ given by (\ref{202004111044}), simple calculus gives 
\bea\label{202004111101}
c_{\bar{q}(3)/2}(q_1,q_2,q_3)
&=&
\frac{q_1!q_2!q_3!}
{\left(\frac{q_1+q_2-q_3}{2}\right)!\left(\frac{q_2+q_3-q_1}{2}\right)!\left(\frac{q_1+q_3-q_2}{2}\right)!}
\eea
from (\ref{202004111042}). 
In conclusion, $c_{\bar{q}(3)/2}(q_1,q_2,q_3)$ is possibly non-zero
only when $\bar{q}(3)$ is even and $(q_1,q_2,q_3)\in\bbT$, and then 
$c_{\bar{q}(3)/2}(q_1,q_2,q_3)$ is given by (\ref{202004111101}) 
(for $\nu=\bar{q}(3)/2$ and $\nu_1$ in (\ref{202004111044})).

If $q_{m'}\geq2$, then we apply the product formula (\ref{202003151619}) on p.\pageref{202003151619}

If $q_{m'}\geq2$ and $q_{m'}=q$, then

In this case, for $\nu=q-1$, 
%since $I_{q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu}\big(1_{j_{m'}}^{\otimes(q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu)}\big)=1$, we obtain

So, if a term satisfying $q_{m'}\geq2$ and $q_{m'}=q$ appears, then 
in general 
$e(D_{u_n}\cali_n))\leq e(\cali_n)$, according to the other estimates (\ref{202004061607}) below. 


If $q_{m'}\geq2$ and $q_{m'}\not=q$, then $q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu$ never attains $0$. 
Indeed, the terms for $\nu\leq\min\{q_{m'}-1,q-1\}$ can only remain 
in the product formula, and this implies $\nu$ can be $2^{-1}(q_{m'}+q)-1$ 
(equivalently, $q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu=0$) 
among such $\nu$s only when $q_{m'}=q$. 
We may consider $\nu$ such that $q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu>0$ for the least favorable case; 
otherwise $q_{m'}+q-2-2\nu<0$ and then the exponent is $-\infty$. 
In this situation,

\subsection{Stability of the class $[S]$}
\begin{proposition}\label{202012292110}
Suppose that $\cali_n$ admits an expression (\ref{202004251257}) 
with $A_n(j_1,...,j_m)$ satisfying Condition $[S]$. 
Then a version of density $D^i_{t_1,...,t_i}\cali_n$ satisfies 
\beas 
\sup_{n\in\bbN}\sup_{t_1,...,t_i\in[0,1]}\big\|D^i_{t_1,...,t_i}\cali_n\big\|_p
&\leq& 
K(i,p)n^{e(\cali_n)}
\eeas
for every $i\in\bbZ$ and $p>1$, 
where $K(i,p)$ is a constant determined by a finite number of $C(i,p)$'s in Condition $[S]$. 
\end{proposition}
\proof 
According to the discussion below, we may show the claim for $i=1$. 
We have 
\beas 
D_s\cali_n 
&=&
n^{\alpha}
\sum_{j_1,...,j_m=1}^nD_sA_n(j_1,...,j_m)
I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})

I_{q_2}(f_{j_2}^{(2)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})+\cdots
\nn\\&=:&
\bbK_n^{(0)}+\bbK_n^{(1)}+\cdots+\bbK_n^{(m)}
\eeas
where $j_1(s)$ is $j_1$ such that $s\in I_{j_1}$. 
Obviously, $\sup_{t\in[0,1]}\sup_{n\in\bbN}\big\|\bbK_n^{(0)}\big\|_p=O(n^{e(\cali_n)})$ 
for every $p>1$ because $e(\cali_n)=e(\bbK_n^{(0)})$. 
%
For $\bbK_n^{(1)}$, the $L^p$-norm $\|\bbK_n^{(1)}\|_p$ is bounded by 
the product of 
$q_1\|I_{q_1-1}(f_{j_1(s)}^{(1)})\|_{2p}=O(n^{-0.5(q_1-1)})$ and 
\beas &&
\sup_{n\in\bbN}\sup_{j\in\bbJ_n}\bigg\|
n^{\alpha}
\sum_{j_2,...,j_m=1}^nA_n(j_1,...,j_m)

for 
\beas 
\xi 
&=& 
\alpha-0.5(q_2+\cdots+q_m)+(m-1)-0.5\sfm_1(q_2,...,q_m).
\eeas
%
Therefore, 
\beas 
\big\|\bbK_n^{(1)}\big\|_p
&=& 
O(n^{\xi'})
\eeas
for 
\beas 
\xi' 
&=& 
\alpha-0.5(q_2+\cdots+q_m)+(m-1)-0.5\sfm_1(q_2,...,q_m)

\alpha-0.5(q_1+\cdots+q_m)+m-0.5\sfm_1(q_1,...,q_m)
\nn\\&\leq&
e(\cali_n)
\eeas
%
We obtain the result since similar estimates hold for other terms and 
it is easy to see each estimate does not depend on $s\in[0,1]$. 
\qed\halflineskip

We can strengthen Proposition \ref{202004091035} (ii). 

\begin{corollary}\label{202012292154}
Under the conditions in Proposition \ref{202004091035}, 
if there is one $m'\in\{1,...m\}$ such that $q_{m'}\not=q$, then 
\beas 
e(D_{u_n(q)}\cali_n) &\leq& e(\cali_n)-\half.
\eeas
\end{corollary}
\proof 
We may suppose that $q_1,...,q_m\geq0$ and $q_1\not=q$. 
Then 
\bea\label{202012292207}
\cali_n &=& 
n^{\alpha-{\sf e}}\sum_{j_1}A'_n(j_1)I_{q_1}(1_{j_1}^{\otimes q_1})
\eea
for 
\beas 
A'_n(j_1)
&=&
n^{{\sf e}}
\sum_{j_2,...,j_m}A_n(j_1,j_2,...,j_m)
I_{q_2}(1_{j_2}^{\otimes q_2})\cdots I_{q_m}(1_{j_m}^{\otimes q_m}),
\eeas
where 
\beas 
{\sf e}
&=& 
e(A'_n(j_1))
\yeq 
-0.5(q_2+\cdots q_m)+(m-1)-0.5\sfm_1(q_2,...,q_m).
\eeas
%
By Proposition \ref{202012292110}, 
we see $A_n'(j_1)$ satisfies Condition $[S]$. 
%
Then, by Proposition \ref{202004091035} (ii), the representation (\ref{202012292207}) gives 
\beas 
e(D_{u_n(q)}\cali_n) 
&\leq& 
\big(\alpha+{\sf e}-0.5q_1+1-0.5\sfm_1(q_1)\big)-0.5

\subsection{The second projection $\boldsymbol{D_{u_n}^2M_n}$
and the quasi-torsion}\label{202004220553}
In this section, we will investigate the quasi-torsion. %to $\Psi(\sfz,\sfx)$. 
The second projection $D_{u_n}^2M_n=D_{u_n}D_{u_n}M_n=\langle D\langle DM_n,u_n\rangle,u_n\rangle$ 
involves various patterns of terms. 
Let

\beas 
\bar{q}(3)&=&q_1+q_2+q_3
\eeas 
for $(q_1,q_2,q_3)\in\calq^3$. 
For random variables $V_n$ and positive numbers $b_n$, we write $V_n=O_{L^\inftym}(b_n)$ 
if $\|V_n\|_p=O(b_n)$ as $n\to\infty$ for every $p>1$. 
%In the following argument, we often dare treat $q$ as a generic natural number in order to clarify the role of the technical assumption that $q$ is even. 
%
Let $\sfz\in\bbR$ and $\sfx\in\bbR$. 


\subsubsection{$\boldsymbol{D_{u_n(q_3)}\bbI_4}$}
Recall the expression equivalent to (\ref{202004041125}): 
\beas 
\bbI_4&=&
-n^{2^{-1}(q_1+q_2)-3}\sum_{j,k}(n^2D_{1_k}D_{1_j}a_j(q_1)) a_k(q_2) I_{q_1-1}(1_j^{\otimes (q_1-1)})I_{q_2-1}(1_k^{\otimes (q_2-1)}).

%
The exponent of $\bbI_4$ by this representation is 
\bea\label{202004121725}

\big(0.5(q_1+q_2)-3\big)-0.5(q_1+q_2-2)+2-0.5\times2

Then, for the Brownian motion $w$, the exponent of $n$ of $\|\bbI_{4,1}\|_p$ is bounded by 
\beas 
0.5(\bar{q}(3)-3)-0.5(\bar{q}(3)-7)-3&=&-1
\eeas
for every $p>1$, 
where $0.5(3q(3)-7)="2^{-1}(\bar{q}-\sfm)"$ from Theorem \ref{0110221242}, 
 and the number $3$ comes from 
the maximum order of $(D_{1_k}D_{1_j}a_j)\beta_{j,\ell}$. 
Thus $\bbI_{4,1}=O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-1})$, and by the same reason $\bbI_{4,1}'=O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-1})$. 
Similarly, $\bbI_{4,2}=O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-1.5})$.

Under (\ref{2020031201810a}) and (\ref{202003251205}), it follows from

where $r'=r/(r-1)$ for any $r>1$. 





Then, %by the first factor on the right-hand side of (\ref{202003241614}) 
by (\ref{202003201508}) and (\ref{2020031201810a}), %(\ref{2020031201810}), 
we see 
$\Phi_{1,1}\to^p0$ as $n\to\infty$. 
Similarly, the convergences $\Phi_{1,i}\to^p0$ ($i=2,3$) follow from 
(\ref{202003201816}), %(\ref{2020031201810}) and (\ref{202003201813}). 
(\ref{2020031201810a}) and (\ref{202005021306}). %(\ref{202003251201}). 
Therefore, $\Phi_1\to^p0$ as $n\to\infty$. 
Condition (\ref{2020031201810a}) %(\ref{2020031201810})

as $n\to\infty$; 
the limit is in $L^\inftym$ since  $E\big[\int_{[0,1]}|a(s,q_2)|^rds\big]<\infty$ for every $r>1$, 
which follows from Fatou's lemma and the assumed convergence in measure. 
%
Similarly we obtain 
\bea\label{202003241646}
\sum_{j,k}(D_{1_k}a_j(q_1))(D_{1_k}a_j(q_2))a_k(2)

Since the second factor on the right-hand side of (\ref{2020031201807}) is tight uniformly in $n\in\bbN$ 
thanks to the boundedness of the moment ensured by (\ref{2020031201810}) of $[A]$, 
Condition (\ref{2020031201805}) of $[A2]$ implies $\Phi_{1,1}\to^p0$ as $n\to\infty$. 
Similarly, 
with the help of  (\ref{2020031201810}) and (\ref{202003201813}), 
Condition (\ref{2020031201805}) gives $\Phi_{1,2}\to^p0$. 
In quite the same way, under (\ref{202003201813}), 
Condition (\ref{202003201816}) gives $\Phi_{1,3}\to^p0$.

\subsubsection{Example}
Let $\calq=\{2\}$, $X_\infty=0$ and let $a\in C^\infty(\bbR)$ 
such that any order of derivative of $a$ is of at most polynomial growth. 
Then $q_1=q_2=q_3=2$ and $\bar{q}(3)=6$ for $q_1,q_2,q_3\in\calq$. 
Let $a_t=a(B_t)$ and $a_j(2)=a(w_\tjm)$ for $j\in\{1,...,n\}$. 
This is the case of a quadratic form of the increments of a Brownian motion 
with predictable weights
\beas 
M_n &=& n^{1/2}\sum_{j=1}^na(w_\tjm)I_2(1_j^{\otimes2}).
\eeas
We remark that the second term of the expression (\ref{202003181159}) vanishes 
in this example because of the strong predictability of $a_j(q)$, while 
such a predictability condition is not assumed in the general context 
in this paper.

G_\infty &=& \int_0^12a_t^2dt.

\bea\label{202003171724}
E\big[\Psi(\sfz,\sfx){\mathfrak S}^{(3,0)}_n(\tti\sfz)\big]

\eeas
Here $a'_s=a'(w_s)$ and $(aa')'_s=(aa')'(w_s)$. 

The random symbol $\sigma(\tti\sfz)$ coincides 
with the full random symbol $\sigma$ 
(without $\tti\sfx$) of Yoshida (\cite{yoshida2013martingale}, p.918) and also with 
${\mathfrak S}^{3,0}$ %(without $\tti\sfx$) 
of Nualart and Yoshida (\cite{nualart2019asymptotic}, p.37). 
In this example, it is known that the full random symbol, which is the sum of 
the adaptive random symbol (tangent) and the anticipative random symbol (torsion), in the martingale expansion 
corresponds to only the quasi-torsion in the theory of asymptotic expansion for Skorohod integrals. 
In other words, the quasi-tangent disappears in this example; see the above papers or Section \ref{202003171756}.

Since the hypercontractivity yields

We have the decomposition (\ref{202004041259}) of $G_n^{(2)}$ and (\ref{202004121705}),

Applying Theorem \ref{0110221242} to $\{\cdots\}$ below, we see that

so that

\bbI_{1,2} &=& O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-1/2})

from (\ref{202004041510}).

By applying Theorem \ref{0110221242} to the first sum on the right-hand side of (\ref{202004041539})

Therefore,

In any case, 
\bea\label{202004041607}
\bbI_{2,2} &=& O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-1/2})

 because of (\ref{20200404552}).

In Theorem \ref{0112121225}, $X_n=X_\infty$, therefore $\dotx_n=0$.

\sum_{q\in\calq}n^{q/2}\sum_{j=1}^n(D_{1_j}a_j(q) )I_{q-1}(1_j^{\otimes (q-1)})

Condition (\ref{202003301112}) holds obviously because $\psi_n=1$ now.

\subsection{An example that satisfies (\ref{2020041446})}\label{202004201231}
Suppose that $A\in C^\infty_p(\bbR)$, the space of smooth functions on $\bbR$ with derivatives of at most polynomial growth. Fix a $q\in\calq$. 
For a Wiener process $w=(w_t)_{t\in[0,1]}$, let $a_j(q)^2=A(w_{1-\tj})$. 
Let $a(t,q)^2=A(w_{1-t})$. 
Then 
\beas 
U_n &:=& \sum_{j=1}^nn^{-1}a_j(q)^2-\int_0^1a(t,q)^2dt
\nn\\&=&
\sum_{j=1}^nn^{-1}A(w_{1-\tj})-\int_0^1A(w_{1-t})dt
\nn\\&=&
\sum_{j=1}^n\int_{I_j}\big\{A(w_{1-\tj})-A(w_{1-t})\big\}dt
\eeas
%
Let 
\beas 
f_{n-j+1}(s)&=&f_{n-j+1,n}(s)\yeq {\sred -}n\int_{I_j}1_{[1-\tj,1-t]}(s)dt
\eeas
for $j\in\{1,...,n\}$. 
Obviously, 
$\sup_{n\in\bbN}\sup_{j=1,...,n}\sup_{s\in[0.1]}|f_j(s)|\leq1$ and 
%
we have 
\beas 
\int_{I_j}(w_{1-\tj}-w_{1-t})dt
&=& 
\int_{I_j}I_1\big(1_{[0,1-\tj]}-1_{[0,1-t]}\big)dt
\yeq
{\sred -}\int_{I_j}I_1\big(1_{[1-\tj,1-t]}\big)dt
\nn\\&=&
{\sred -}I_1\bigg(\int_{I_j}1_{[1-\tj,1-t]}dt\bigg)
\yeq
n^{-1}I_1(f_{n-j+1}).
\eeas
%
With 
\beas 
R_n &=& 
\sum_j\int_{I_j}\int_0^1(1-s)A''\big(w_{1-t}+s(w_{1-\tj}-w_{1-t})\big)ds\>(w_{1-\tj}-w_{1-t})^2dt,
\eeas
we write 
\beas
U_n 
&=& 
\sum_jA'(w_{1-\tj})\int_{I_j}(w_{1-\tj}-w_{1-t})dt+R_n
\nn\\&=&
\bbL_n+R_n
\eeas
where 
\beas 
\bbL_n &=& 
n^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^nA'(w_{1-\tj})I_1(f_{n-j+1})
\yeq
n^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^nA'(w_{\tjm})I_1(f_j).
\eeas
%
Thne it is not difficult to show 
\beas 
R_n &=& O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1})
\eeas
as $n\to\infty$. 
%
Since the exponent 
\beas
e(\bbL_n) &=& -1-0.5\times1+1-0.5\times1 \yeq -1, 
\eeas
we obtain 
\beas 
\bbL_n &=& O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1}). 
\eeas
Consequently, 
$U_n=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1})$ as $n\to\infty$. 
This means (\ref{2020041446}) is satisfied in the present example. 








\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{202004171845}}\label{202004171914}
We will verify Condition $[C]$ to apply Theorem \ref{202004011551}. 
Condition $[A^\sharp]$ is assumed now. 

\subsection{$[C]$ (i) and (iv) {\sred (a)}}
$u_n, N_n\in\bbD^\infty$ %=\cap_{s>0}\cap_{p>1}\bbD^{s,p}$ 
under $[A]$ (\ref{ai}),
$G_\infty\in\bbD^\infty$ under $[A]$ (\ref{aviii}), and 
$X_\infty=X_n\in\bbD^\infty$ uder $[A]$ (\ref{aix}). 
%
Condition $[C]$ (iv) {\sred (a) is ensured by} $[A^\sharp]$ (II). 

\subsection{$[C]$ (ii)}\label{202004220440}
Since $[A^\sharp]$ is stronger than $[A]$, we can use all results proved in Section \ref{202003141657}. 
Lemma \ref{202004031134} verifies the estimate (\ref{202004011421}). 

According to 
(\ref{202004041259}), 
(\ref{202004121705}). 
(\ref{202004121706}) and 
(\ref{202004121707}), 
$G_n^{(2)}$ admits the following decomposition: 
\beas 
G_n^{(2)} 
&=& 
\widetilde{\bbJ}_1+\widetilde{\bbJ}_2
\eeas
where 
\beas 
\widetilde{\bbJ}_1
&=& 
\sum_{q_1,q_2\in\calq}\bbJ_{1,1}-G_\infty
\yeq
\sum_{q\in\calq}\bigg\{\sum_jn^{-1}{\sred q!}a_j(q)^2-{\sred q!}\int_0^1a(t,q)^2dt\bigg\}
\eeas
and 
\beas 
\widetilde{\bbJ}_2 
&=& 
\sum_{q_1,q_2\in\calq}\big(\bbJ_{1,2}+\bbI_2+\bbI_3+\bbI_4\big).
\eeas

(\ref{202004121725}) on p.\pageref{202004121725}, 
therefore, 
\bea\label{202012301910}
\widetilde{\bbJ}_2
&=& 
O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5})
\eea
%
Condition (\ref{2020041446}) of $[A^\sharp]$ (\ref{aviii}$^\sharp$) 
on p.\pageref{2020041446} assumes 
\bea\label{202012301911}
\widetilde{\bbJ}_2
&=& 
O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5-\kappa}). 
\eea
%
Therefore, Proposition \ref{202004121624} implies 
\beas 
G_n^{(2)} &=& O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-0.5}),
\eeas
and hence 
Condition (\ref{202004011422}) is verified. 
%
On the other hand, Condition (\ref{202004011425}) follows from 
the estimate (\ref{2020014131453}).

It follows from (\ref{202004131307}) that 
$G_n^{(3)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1/2})$, therefore (\ref{202004011423}) is satisfied. 
Moreover, we see $D_{u_n}G_n^{(3)}=O_{\bbD^\infty}(n^{-1})$
from (\ref{202004131448}). Thus we verified (\ref{202004011423}) and (\ref{202004011424}). 
%
Properties (\ref{202004011426}) and (\ref{202004011427}) follow from 
(\ref{202004131515}) and (\ref{202004131519}).

Properties (\ref{202004011428}) and (\ref{202004011429}) follow from 
(\ref{202014131536}) and (\ref{202014131537}), respectively, 
since $\dotx_n=0$ in the present situation. 
%
Condition $[C]$ (ii) has been checked. 

\subsection{$[C]$ (iii)}
Now $\beta_x=2$, and $[C]$ (iii) (a) is verified by using $[A^\sharp]$ (i$^\sharp$). 
We already observed the convergences requested by $[C]$ (iii) (b).

and this estimate is uniform in $v\in\mH$ 
since Proposition \ref{202004121624} is based on Theorem \ref{0110221242}.

where the we can take a factor for $O_{L^\inftym}(n^{-0.5)})$ independently from $v\in\mH$. 
The inequality (\ref{202004261221}) means 
\bea\label{202004261237}
\big|D^i\bbI^{(3)}_n(q)\big|_{\mH^{\otimes (i+1)}}

In this connection, for $\bbI^{(1)}_n[v]$, $\bbI^{(2)}_n[v]$ and $\bbI^{(4)}_n[v]$,

\section{Proof for Section \ref{202004021507}}\label{202004270654}
\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{202004210802}}\label{202004210757}
It suffices to check Condition $[B]$ for $\psi_n=1$ and $(Z_n,X_n)$ in Section \ref{202004021507}, 
that is, $Z_n=M_n+n^{1/2}N_n$, where $N_n$ and $X_n$ are general. 
%
Under the conditions in $[A]$ except for $[A]$ (\ref{avii}), 
the argument in Sections \ref{202004211724}, \ref{202004220553}, \ref{202003171756} and \ref{20204211726} 
(without consideration for the specific $N_n$) 
is valid. In particular, we have the convergence of 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(3,0)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}^{(3,0)}$, 
${\mathfrak S}_{0,n}^{(2,0)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}_0^{(2,0)}=0$ 
and 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(1,1)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}^{(1,1)}$ 
in the sense of (\ref{202004220244}) in $[B]$ (iii). 
The convergences 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(1,0)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}^{(1,0)}$, 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(0,1)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}^{(0,1)}$, 
${\mathfrak S}_{1,n}^{(2,0)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}_1^{(2,0)}$ 
and
${\mathfrak S}_{1,n}^{(1,1)}$ to ${\mathfrak S}_1^{(1,1)}$ 
in the sense of (\ref{202004220244}) in $[B]$ (iii) 
are assumed in $[D]$. 
Therefore, Condition $[B]$ (iii) is satisfied. 
%
Condition $[B]$ (i) is obvious if we combine the observations in Section \ref{202004220324} and 
Condition $[D]$ (II). 
%
Sections \ref{202004220327}-\ref{202004220330} verify 
the estimates (\ref{202003301101})-(\ref{202003301108}) of $[B]$ (ii), 
and the estimates (\ref{202003301109})-(\ref{202003301111}) are assumed in $[D]$ (II). 
Therefore $[B]$ (ii) has been checked. 
Now we can apply Theorem \ref{202004011550} to prove Theorem \ref{202004210802}. 




\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{202004211628}}\label{202004211638}
We should check the conditions in $[C]$. 
%
Condition $[C]$ (i) holds obviously under $[D^\sharp]$. 
%
Condition $[A^\sharp]$ without $[A^\sharp]$ (I) (\ref{avii}$^\sharp$), which holds under $[D^\sharp]$, 
is stronger than $[A]$ without $[A]$ (\ref{avii}), 
and $[A]$ without $[A]$ (\ref{avii}) is sufficient to follow the argument 
in Section \ref{202004220440} except for the last part concerning 
(\ref{202004011428}) and (\ref{202004011429}). 
However, the last two properties are assumed by $[D^\sharp]$ (II). 
Therefore $[C]$ (ii) is satisfied under $[D^\sharp]$. 
%
Condition $[C]$ (iii) (a) is satisfied with $[D^\sharp]$ (I) {\sred (i$^\sfx$}) and $[D^\sharp]$ (III). 
We already found $\overline{{\mathfrak T}}_n$ for 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(3,0)}$, ${\mathfrak S}_{0,n}^{(2,0)}$ and ${\mathfrak S}_n^{(1,1)}$,  
and their convergence in the sense of 
%(\ref{202004220244}) in $[B]$ (iii),  
{\sred $[C]$ (iii) (b),}
from the argument in Sections \ref{202004211724}, \ref{202004220553}, \ref{202003171756} and \ref{20204211726}. 
Since Condition $[D^\sharp]$ (III) takes care of the convergence of 
${\mathfrak S}_n^{(1,0)}$, ${\mathfrak S}_n^{(0,1)}$, ${\mathfrak S}_{1,n}^{(2,0)}$ 
and ${\mathfrak S}_{1,n}^{(1,1)}$, 
Condition $[C]$ (iii) is verified. 
Condition $[C]$ (iv) has been verified with $[A^\sharp]$ (II); see Section \ref{202004261803}. 
%is nothing but Condition $[D^\sharp]$ (II). 
%
This completes the proof of Theorem \ref{202004211628}.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{202005110453}% (Asymptotic expansion for $\bbV_n$)
}\label{202005141659}
\subsubsection{Decomposition of $Z_n$}
For the reference variable $X_\infty$ in the general theory, 
let us consider $X_1$, the value of the process $X=(X_t)_{t\in\bbR_+}$ evaluated at $t=1$. 
It is known that $X_1\in\bbD^\infty$ and $\Delta_{X_1}$ is non-degenerate if 
the stochastic differential equation is uniformly elliptic. 
%
In this situation, $\calq=\{2\}$ and 
\bea\label{202005112246}
a_j(2) 
&=& 
{\colorr\Theta_j}(b^{[1]}_\tjm)^2
\yeq
{\colorr\Theta_j}\beta_\tjm.
\eea





The density of the Malliavin derivative $DX_\tau$ is expressed explicitly by 
\beas 
D_sX_\tau 
&=& 
Y_\tau Y_s^{-1}\sigma_s1_{\{s\leq\tau\}}
\eeas
for $\tau\in\bbR_+$, 
where $Y=(Y_t)_{t\in\bbR_+}$ is the unique solution to the variational equation
\beas 
\left\{\begin{array}{ccl}
dY_t &=& \sigma'(X_t)Y_tdw_t+b'(X_t)Y_tdt \\
Y_0 &=& 1.
\end{array}\right.
\eeas
%
Similarly, 
\beas 
D_tD_sX_\tau
&=& 
Y_\tau Y_s^{-1}\sigma_s\sigma'_t1_{\{s<t\leq\tau\}}
+
Y_\tau Y_t^{-1}\sigma_t\sigma'_s1_{\{t<s\leq\tau\}}
\nn\\&=&
Y_\tau Y_{s\wedge t}^{-1}\sigma_{s\wedge t}\sigma'_{s\vee t}1_{\{s,t\leq\tau\}}.
\eeas
So it is natural to write 
\beas 
D_tD_tX_\tau
&=& 
Y_\tau Y_t^{-1}\sigma_t\sigma'_t1_{\{t\leq\tau\}}.
\eeas
The derivatives of $U_\infty$ and $L_{\infty,t}$ up to the second order 
are expressed with those of $X_\tau$ for $\tau\in\bbR_+$. 
For example, $D_tD_tU_\infty$ is well defined through the expression of $D_tD_tX_\tau$. 
In particular, these derivatives are stable in Lebesgue measure in limiting operations.

The functional $N_n^{\sf o}$ of (\ref{202005120741}) satisfies 
\bea\label{202005120749}

for $i=1$
due to Propositioin \ref{202004091035} applied to the expressions

the estimate (\ref{202005120749}) for $i=2$. 
Thus, Conditions (\ref{202004011428}) and (\ref{202004011429}) are fulfilled

In the following lemma, $d_s$ stands for the $\calf$-stable convergence. 
\begin{lemma}\label{202005132036}
 Suppose that Condition $[E]$ is satisfied. Then 
there exist Wiener processes $W^{(0)}$, $W^{(1)}$, ..., $W^{(\nu)}$ independent of $\calf$ such that 
\beas 
\big(\calx_n,\caly_n\big) &\to^{d_s}& \big(\calx_\infty,\caly_\infty\big)
\eeas
as $n\to\infty$, where 
\beas
\calx_\infty &=& \int_0^1 (q_0!)^{1/2}A(s)dW^{(0)}_s
\eeas
and 
\bea\label{2020051319122}

\cdot
dW^{(1)}_{t_{1,1}}\cdots dW^{(1)}_{t_{1,m_1}}\cdots dW^{(\nu)}_{t_{\nu,1}}\cdots dW^{(\nu)}_{t_{\nu,m_\nu}}
\eea
Moreover, 
$W^{(1)}$, ..., $W^{(\nu)}$ are independent. 
$W^{(0)}=W^{(q_i)}$ if 
$q_i=q_0$ for some $i\in\{1,..,\nu\}$, 
otherwise, $W^{(0)}$, $W^{(1)}$, ..., $W^{(\nu)}$ are independent. 
The integral $\caly_\infty$ includes the diagonal elements. 
\end{lemma}
%
\proof 
$L^p$-estimate of the functional of type $\caly_n$ is discussed in Section \ref{202003141640}, 
and it is observed that $\caly_n$ is near to $0$ in $\bbD^\infty$ if 
the coefficients are uniformly close to $0$ in $\bbD^\infty$. 
This implies that for any $\ep>0$, there exists $K\in\bbN$ such that 
\beas 
\limsup_{n\to\infty}\big\|\caly_n-\wt{\caly}_n\big\|_2 &<& \ep
\eeas
for
\beas 
\wt{\caly}_n 
&=& 
n^{0.5(q\cdot m-|m|)}
\sum_{j_{1,1},...j_{1,m_1}=1}^n\cdots \sum_{j_{\nu,1},...j_{\nu,m_\nu}=1}^n 
B(S(j_{1,1},...,j_{\nu,m_\nu}))
\nn\\&&\hspace{90pt}\times
I_{q_1}(1_{j_{1,1}}^{\otimes q_1})\cdots I_{q_1}(1_{j_{1,m_1}}^{\otimes q_m})
\cdots
I_{q_\nu}(1_{j_{\nu,1}}^{\otimes q_\nu})\cdots I_{q_\nu}(1_{j_{\nu,m_\nu}}^{\otimes q_\nu})
\eeas
where $S(j_{1,m_1},...,j_{\nu,m_\nu})$ is the nearest lower grid point in $\{0/K,...,(K-1)/K\}^{q\cdot m}$ 
from $(j_{1,1},...,j_{\nu,m_\nu})/n$. 
Therefore, by the Bernstein blocks, 
the problem is reduced to the stable central limit theorem 
in sub-cubes made with vertices in  $\{0/K,...,(K-1)/K\}^{q\cdot m}$. 
Then the limit of $\wt{\caly}_n$ becomes an elementary integral of $B$ with respect to 
the suitably scaled Wiener processes appearing as the stable limit. 
And it is near to $\caly_\infty$.

\section{Estimate of a multilinear form of multiple Wiener integrals}\label{202003141640}
\subsection{Basic estimates}
%
Let $\bbW=\{\bbW(h)\}_{h\in\mH}$ be a Gaussian process on a real separable Hilbert space $\mH$. 
Let ${\bf q}=(q_1,...,q_m)\in\bbN^m$, for $m\in\bbN=\{1,2,...\}$.  
We will consider a sum of multilinear forms of multiple Wiener integrals
\bea\label{202005150105} 
\bbI_n &=& \sum_{j_1,...,j_m=1}^n
%A_n(j_1,...,j_m)I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})^{p_1}\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})^{p_m}
A_n(j_1,...,j_m)I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})
\eea
for $f^{(i)}_{j_i}\in\mH^{\tilde{\otimes} q_i}$, the $q_i$-th symmetric tensors, $i=1,...,m$. 
The random coefficients $A_n(j_1,...,j_m)$ can be anticipative. 
%
We already met many such functionals in the previous sections. 
An example of $\bbI_n$ is 
%%
\begin{en-text}
\beas 
\bbI_n 
&=&
\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{\ell=1}^n
\bigg((D_ta_\tjm)1_j(s)a_{t_{k-1}}1_k(t)a_{t_{\ell-1}}1_\ell(s)\bigg)
\big(B_{t_j}-B_{t_{j-1}}\big)\big(B_t-B_{t_{k-1}}\big)\big(B_s-B_{t_{\ell-1}}\big)
\eeas
for $s,t\in[0,T]$. 
\end{en-text}
%%
% 
\beas 
\bbI_n 
&=&
\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{\ell=1}^n
\bigg((D_sD_ta_{t_{j-1}}a_{t_{k-1}}1_k(t)a_{t_{\ell-1}}1_\ell(s)\bigg)
\\&&
\hspace{50pt}\times
\big((B_\tj-B_\tjm)^2-(\tj-\tjm)\big)
\big(B_t-B_{t_{k-1}}\big)\big(B_s-B_{t_{\ell-1}}\big)
\eeas
for $s,t\in[0,T]$, a fractional Brownian motion $B=(B_t)$ dwelling in $\bbW$ and 
$(a_r)\subset\bbD^\infty$.  
The monomial $\bbI_n^{2k}$ is also an example of $\bbI_n$, $k\in\bbN$. 
The coefficient 
$A_n(j_1,...,j_m)$ can have the factor $\Psi_\infty$ appearing in the context of the theory of asymptotic expansion. 
%
To introduce the notion of exponent, an $L^p$-estimate for $\bbI_n$ and the generated algebra 
played an essential role. 
This section will give an $L^p$-estimate of $\bbI_n$. 



 Suppose that 
%$A_n(j_1,...,j_m)\in\bbD^{{\bf p}\cdot{\bf q},2}$ 
%with ${\bf p}\cdot{\bf q}=\sum_{i=1}^mp_iq_i$. %$\bar{q}=\sum_{i=1}^mq_i$. 
Denote $\bar{q}=\bar{q}_1=\sum_{i=1}^mq_i$ and $\bar{r}=\bar{r}_{1} = r_1+\cdots+r_{m-2}+r_{m-1}$.  
Suppose that 
\bea\label{202005150138}
A_n(j_1,...,j_m)&\in&\bbD^{\bar{q},2}. 
\eea
%
The symmetrized $r$-contraction of a tensor product is denoted by $\tilde{\otimes}_r$. 
for $(r_1,...,r_{m-1})\in\bbZ_+^{m-1}$. 
We have the following estimate for $\bbI_n$ defined by (\ref{202005150105}). 
%
\begin{proposition}\label{0110210701}
Suppose that Condition (\ref{202005150138}) is satisfied. Then 
\beas 
\big|E[\bbI_n]\big|
&\leq&
\sum_{j_1,...,j_m=1}^n\big|E[\bbI_n]\big|
\\&\leq&
C(q_1,...,q_m)\sum_{r_1,...,r_{m-1}}
\sum_{j_1,...,j_m=1}^n
\bigg|E\big[\big\langle D^{\bar{q}_{1}-2\bar{r}_{1}}A_n(j_1,...,j_m),
f_{j_{1}}^{(1)}\tilde{\otimes}_{r_{1}}\cdots\tilde{\otimes}_{r_{m-1}}f_{j_m}^{(m)}
\big\rangle_{\mH^{\otimes(\bar{q}_{1}-2\bar{r}_{1})}}\big]\bigg|
\eeas
for some constant $C(q_1,...,q_m)$ depending only on $q_1,...,q_m$. 
\end{proposition}
\proof 
Repeatedly apply the product formula to 
$I_{q_1}(f_{j_1}^{(1)})\cdots I_{q_m}(f_{j_m}^{(m)})$ 
to reach a linear combination of Skorohod integrals of order $\bar{q}_1-2\bar{r}_1$. 
The sum $\sum_{r_1,...,r_{m-1}}$ is finite. 
Next use duality for $\delta^{\bar{q}_1-2\bar{r}_1}$.

\subsection{$L^p$-estimate for a multilinear form of multiple Wiener integrals for discretization}
%
Consider a double sequence of numbers $t_j=t^n_j$ ($i=1,...n$, $n\in\bbN$) such that 
\bea\label{202005170230} 
0= t_0<t_1<\cdots<t_n, &&\max_{j=0,1,...,n}(\tj-\tjm)\leq T/n
\eea
for a constant $T>0$. 
For example, $(t_j)$ is a double sequence such that 
$0= t_0<t_1<\cdots<t_n\leq T_0$ and that $\max_{j=1,...,n}(\tj-\tjm)\leq2T_0/n$ for $T=2T_0$. 

Let $I_j=I^n_j=1_{(\tjm,\tj]}$.\footnote{$I_j$ denotes the $j$-th interval. 
The mapping of the $q$-th multiple integral is denoted by $I_q(\cdot)$ but 
there is no fear of confusion thanks to the argument of $I_q$. } 
%
From now on we let $\mH=L^2([0,T],dt)$. 
We will consider a double sequence $f_{j_i}^{(i)}=f_{j_i}^{(i),n}\in\mH^{\tilde{\otimes}q_j}$ such that 
$\text{supp}(f_{j_i}^{(i)})\subset I_j^{\>q_i}$ and that 
\bea\label{0110231323}
\max_{i=1,...,m}\>\sup_{n\in\bbN}\sup_{j_i=1,...,n}
\sup_{t_1,...,t_{q_i}\in[0,T]}|f_{j_i}^{(i)}(t_1,...,t_{q_i})|&\leq&C_1
\eea
for a constant $C_1$. 
%
Let $k\in\bbN$. 
Suppose that $A_n(j_1,...,j_m)\in\bbD^{2k\bar{q},4k}%\bbD^{s=2k\bar{q},p=4k}
$ (the derivatives up to $2k$-th order are in $L^{4k}$) and 
\bea\label{0110231324}
\max_{i=0,1,...,2k\bar{q}}\>
\sup_{n\in\bbN}\sup_{(j_1,...,j_m)\in\{1,...,n\}^m}
\sup_{t_1,...,t_i\in[0,T]}
\big\|D^i_{t_1,...,t_i}A_n(j_1,...,j_m)\big\|_{4k}&\leq&C_0
\eea
for some constant $C_0$. 
%

In the following theorem, we apply the duality of the Skorohod integrals, as it was used in 
Proposition \ref{0110210701} and Corollary \ref{0110221510}, to

Remark that each nonnegative integer $R_{a,b}$ is bounded by 
a suitable number so that each contraction makes sense. 
Each contraction has implicitly chosen a set of arguments 
in the factor in front of it and the all factors after it. 
Later this set will vary between all possible cases, but 
we fix an ${\bf R}$ for the meantime. 
%For a pattern of the contractions, suppose that there are $c$ connected components of functions $f^{(*)}_{*}$ generated by the contractions with $R_{a,b}\geq1$. 

We call the factor $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$ is {\it single} if 
all its arguments are free from any contraction specifically allocated according to ${\bf R}$. 
A single factor $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$ has $q_i$ arguments $(t_1,...,t_{q_i})$, and 
this factor contributions to $S$ by 
a factor of order $O(n^{-(q_i-1)})$ after summation 
$\sum_{j_i=1}^n\big|\bbE_n({\bf j}, {\bf R})\big|$, due to 
the specific support of $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$. 

We consider connection between two $f^{(*)}_*$s by a contraction. 
In a connected component $\calc$ (having at least two $f^{(*)}_*$s), suppose that ${\sf r}$ $(\geq1)$ contractions exist. 
Let ${\sf q}$ be the sum of the numbers of arguments of ${\sf m}$ functions, 
$f^{(i_1)}_{j_1},...,f^{(i_{\sf m})}_{ 
j_{\sf m}} $ say, consisting of $\calc$. 
We have ${\sf q}=q_{i_1}+\cdots+q_{i_{{\sf m}}}$ 
since each $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$ has $q_i$ arguments. 
Connected two arguments of (different) $f^{(*)}_*$s in $\calc$ give 
a factor of order $O(n^{-1})$ (before summing up with respect to involving $j$'s). 
So, $2{\sf r}$ arguments give totally a factor of order $O(n^{-{\sf r}})$. 
On the other hand, the rest of the arguments appearing in $\calc$ gives 
a factor of order $O(n^{-({\sf q}-2{\sf r})})$. 
The multiple sum with respect to $j$'s in $\calc$ becomes a single sum 
by the orthogonality,
because $\calc$ is connected. 
Thus, after summation with respect $j_1=\cdots=j_{{\sf m}}$, 
the component $\calc$ contributes to $S({\bf R})$ with a factor of the order 
\bea\label{0110231459} 
n\times n^{-({\sf q}-2{\sf r})}\times n^{-{\sf r}}
\yeq 
n^{1+{\sf r}-{\sf m}-\sum_{i=i_1,...,i_{\sf m}}(q_i-1)}
\ygeq
n^{-\sum_{i=i_1,...,i_{\sf m}}(q_i-1)}. 
\eea
Here we used the inequality $1+{\sf r}\geq {\sf m}$. 
Inequality (\ref{0110231459}) suggests we should consider 
the allocations of contractions that do not involve any single $f^{(*)}_{*}$, 
in order to find the dominating term. 

We consider an allocation of contractions according to ${\sf R}$ that  
has 
$c$ connected components with $c\geq1$ and has no single $f^{(*)}_*$. 
Then 
\beas 
S({\bf R})
%\sum_{{\bf j}}\sup\!\!\>^*\big|\bbE_n({\bf j}, {\bf R})\big|
&=&
O(n^{c+\bar{R}_1-2km-(\bar{Q}_1-2km)})
\yeq
O(n^{c+\bar{R}_1-\bar{Q}_1}). 
\eeas
Since the contraction takes place between different two functions $f^{(*)}_{*}$, 
each connected component has at least two functions $f^{(*)}_{*}$, therefore, 
the maximum $c$ is $km$. 
The maximum $\bar{R}_1$ is $k\bar{q}$. 
(Indeed, there is a pattern of contractions for which $c=km$ and $\bar{R}_1=k\bar{q}$.) 
Consequently, 
\beas 
S({\bf R})
%\sum_{{\bf j}}\sup\!\!\>^*\big|\bbE_n({\bf j}, {\bf R})\big|
&=&
O(n^{km+k\bar{q}-\bar{Q}_1})
\yeq
O(n^{-k(\bar{q}-m)})
\eeas
for any pattern of allocation of contractions. 
The existence of a constant $C\big(q_1,...,q_m,k,T\big)%C\big(q_1,...,q_m,k,T,C_0,C_1\big)
$ is 
obvious if one observes the above argument precisely. 
This completes the proof.

\subsection{$L^p$-estimate of an integrated functional on a compact group}
%We will consider a double sequence $t^n_j$ satisfying (\ref{202005170230}). 
Let $m\in\bbN$ and $q_1,...,q_m\in\bbN$. 
For each $i\in\{1,...,m\}$, let $G^{(i)}$ be a compact group with a Haar measure $\mu^{(i)}$. 
Let $G=G_1\times \cdots G_m$ and $\mu=\mu_1\times\cdots\times\mu_m$.

%Let $\mH=L^2(\bbT,dt)$ with $\bbT=[0,T]$. 
Let $e^{(i)}_{n,j}:G^{(i)}\to\mH^{\tilde{\otimes}q_i}$ for $j\in\bbJ_n=\{1,...,n\}$, $n\in\bbN$ and $i=1,...,m$. 
%Then $e^{(i)}_{n,j_1}$ can be identified with an element $e^{(i)}_{n,j_1}:\bbT^{q_i}\times G^{(i)}\to\bbR$.

The order $O(n^{-1})$ is different from the order  
$E[\Psi({\sf z}, {\sf x})\cali_1]=O(n^{-1.5})$, however 
these bounds do not conflict with each other 
because the bound obtained here is an $L^p$-bound. 
%
As for $L^p$-estimate of the derivative of the quasi-torsion, 
$\|D_{u_n}D_{u_n}D_{u_n}M_n\|_p=o(r_n)$ follows from this estimate 
in the martingale expansion approach.

In the present situation, by the orthogonality due to 
the specific support of $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$, 

the summations in $E[\check{\bbI}_n]$ (or in $\check{\bbI}_n$) 
become $c$ summations corresponding to $c$ connected components. 
Since each contraction gives a factor of order $O(n^{-1})$, 
we get a factor of order $O(n^{-\bar{R}_1})$ from the whole contractions. 
Moreover, the inner product in the expression of $\bbE_n$ gives 
a factor of order $O(n^{-(\bar{Q}_1-2\bar{R}_1)})$. 
Therefore, 
\beas
|\bbE_n| 
&=&
O(n^{c+\bar{R}_1-\bar{Q}_1}).
\eeas
Since the contraction takes place, if exists, between different factors $f^{(*)}_{*}$, 
the maximum $c$ is $km$. 
The maximum $\bar{R}_1$ is $k\bar{q}$. 
(Indeed, there is a pattern of contractions for which $c=km$ and $\bar{R}_1=k\bar{q}$.) 
Therefore
\beas 
c+\bar{R}_1-\bar{Q}_1
&=& 
c+\bar{R}_1-2k\bar{q}
\yleq 
km-k\bar{q},
\eeas
and hence we generally conclude 
\beas
|\bbE_n| 
&=&
O(n^{-k(\bar{q}-m)}).

This completes the proof.

In fact, one contraction of an argument of $f^{(i)}_{j_i}$ and 
and argument of $f^{(i')}_{j_{i'}}$ 
gives order $n^{-1}$ %(this is a very rough estimate), 
\xout{and erases $\sum_{j_{i'}}$.} 
The number of the remaining sums is $2km-\bar{r}_1$. 
The number of the remaining arguments is totally $2k\bar{q}-2\bar{r}_1$, 
that gives $n^{-(2k\bar{q}-2\bar{r}_1)}$ by integration-by-parts. 
Therefore the order of a term of $E[\check{\bbI}_n]$ involving 
$\bar{r}$-contractions is \koko
\beas 
n^{2km\xout{-\bar{r}_1}}\times n^{-\bar{r}_1}\times n^{-(2k\bar{q}-2\bar{r}_1)}
&=&
n^{-2k(\bar{q}-m-2^{-1}\bar{r}_1)}\leq n^{-2k(2^{-1}\bar{q}-m)}.
\eeas
%Therefore the effect of contraction is totally $O(1)$ after $\sum_{j_i}$. 
%Each remaining argument gives factor of $O(n^{-1})$ and

%Suppose that (\ref{0110231324}) for $s=2k\sum_{i=1}p_iq_i$ and $p=4k$.

\proof 
Without loss of generality, we may assume 
with $p_1,...,p_{m-\ell}\geq2$ and $p_{m-\ell+1}=\cdots=p_m=1$; 
in particular, all $P_1,...,p_m\geq2$ when $\ell=0$.

\bigg(\prod_{i=\ell+1}^m I_{q_i}(f_{j_i}^{(i)})\bigg)

2^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m-\ell}1_{\{p_iq_i-2\nu_i=0\}}-2^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m-\ell}(p_iq_i-1)
-2^{-1}\sum_{i=m-\ell+1}^m(p_iq_i-1)

-2^{-1}\sum_{i=m-\ell+1}^m(p_iq_i-1).

\im In this way, we obtain 
\begin{theorem}\label{0111301152} Let $1\leq\ell<m$. 
Let $q_i\geq1$ for $i\in\{1,...,m\}$, and let $p_i\geq2$ for $i\in\{1,...,m-\ell\}$ and 
$p_i=1$ for $i=\{m-\ell+1,...,m\}$. Then 
\beas 
\|\bbK_n\|_{2k} &\leq& C\>n^{-\half\xi}
\eeas
for 
\beas 
\xi
&=&
{\bf p}\cdot{\bf q}-m-\#\big\{i\in\{1,...,m-\ell\};\>p_iq_i\text{ is even}\big\}.
\eeas
\end{theorem}


%\im Remark. The inequality of Theorem \ref{0111301152} is equivalent or sharper than that of Theorem \ref{0111010548}. So, we no longer need Theorem \ref{0111010548}. 

Combining the above two results, we obtain 
\begin{theorem}\label{0112061610} %Let $0\leq\ell<m$. 
Let $q_i\geq1$ for $i\in\{1,...,m\}$. 
%, and let $p_i\geq2$ for $i\in\{1,...,m-\ell\}$ and $p_i=1$ for $i=\{m-\ell+1,...,m\}$
Then 
\beas 
\|\bbK_n\|_{2k} &\leq& C\>n^{-\half\xi}
\eeas
for 
\beas 
\xi
&=&
{\bf p}\cdot{\bf q}-m-\#\big\{i\in\{1,...,m\};\>p_i\geq2\text{ and }\>p_iq_i\text{ is even}\big\}.
\eeas
\end{theorem}
{\colorr \proof This follows from the product formula and the estimate (\ref{202004051415}) in Section \ref{202004270705} based on Theorem \ref{0110221242}. }

latexで数式中に太字にするには
${\bf A}$
とかすればいいんですが、ローマン体になってしまいますし、
ギリシャ文字は太字にならなかったりします。

そこで
%\usepackage{bm}
とboldmathパッケージを使うことをtexファイルのはじめに宣言し
${\bm A}$
とすると、イタリック体の太字にできますし、
${\bm \phi}$
とすると、ギリシャ文字も太字にできます。
