Note that both $f$ and $g$ are increasing in $x_1$ and decreasing in $x_2$.
Based on this we can infer that any local minimizer $\vct{x}^\star$ satisfies $x_2^\star = 20\log\left(( 0.05\exp(x_1^\star) + 1)/0.7673\right)$.
The expression for $x_2$ as a function of $x_1$ can be substituted into $f(x_1,x_2)$.
After performing this substitution, we solve the resulting unconstrained univariate minimization problem to find $(f,\{g\})_{\R^2}^\star \approx 11.9643$.

We consider these signomials in the ring induced by
\[
    \cA = \begin{bmatrix}
             0   &   0 &   0  &  0.85 &  1  \\
            -0.75  &  0  &  0.05 &  0   &  0  
            \end{bmatrix}^\top \in \R^{5 \times 2}
\]
so that $\deg_{\cA}(f) = \deg_{\cA}(g) = 1$.

Despite this problem's simplicity and our ability to solve it nearly by hand, it is known to create difficulties for numerical algorithms.
Claimed optimal objective values include
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{RM1978}-9. Solution evaluates to 11.96392; violates constraints by 5e-6. Other notes: (1) used \textbf{local} optimization algorithms, (2) sourced from the 1970 PhD thesis of Rijckaert, (3) reported objective value was 11.91.
    \item \cite{WL2005}-4. Claimed objective: 11.9538. Other notes (1) added bound constraints and epigraph variable, (2) sourced from a 1990 publication.
    \item \cite{Shen2008}-3.
    Claimed objective: 12.0475.
    Other notes: (1) same formulation as \cite{WL2005}, (2) solution evaluates to 11.96477 and is strictly feasible.
    \item \cite{HSC2014}-2. Claimed objective: 7.8922. Other notes: same formulation as \cite{Shen2008}.
    \item \cite{MCW2019}. Claimed lower bound 11.7 (level (3,3,1) relaxation). Notes (1) claimed feasible solution value (11.9600) is an incorrect transcription of data from the experiments; the correct value should be 11.9643, (2) the bound 11.7 can be reproduced with a primal relaxation, but the dual relaxation gives something more like 11.03; the cause of this difference is not clear to me.

Flow: \cite{RM1978} found the global optimum with local solvers; don't certify as much. Then people looked at global optimization. As with us, proof of convergence with global optimization requires compactness. However, alternative methods are based on branch-and-bound, and hence often cannot meaningfully run without a compact feasible set (and known variable bounds). By adding explicit bounds, \cite{WL2005} report a solution with objective value 11.9538; this is infeasible by 1e-4. A feasibility-focused global optimization method found a solution with objective 12.0475 \cite{Shen2008}. Hu, Shen, and Chen report a solution with objective 7.822, but this violates the constraint by 0.036.
