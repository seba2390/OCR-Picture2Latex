\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we present a light-weight framework LR FTI-FDet in an end-to-end manner for real-time fault detection of freight train images in the wild. The proposed framework consists of a multi-RPN over RFDNet for fault proposal generation and MLPS score maps for fault proposal detection. Experiments show that the Top-1 accuracy of our RFDNet is 6.9\% higher than SqueezeNet with 1.4$\times$ less computation on ImageNet. Our RFDNet achieves 5.8\% mAP higher than SqueezeNet on VOC 2007, and our [0.5:0.95] result is 3.3\% higher than SqueezeNet on MS COCO. The detection results on six fault datasets indicate that our method is much faster during both training and testing as the light-weight detectors. Our method achieves competitive accuracy, 28.4/4.6$\times$ smaller model size and 2.6/2.2$\times$ less memory usage than FTI-FDet/Light FTI-FDet. The proposed LR FTI-FDet has lower resource requirements with the same testing speed as YOLOv3 up to 38 fps, 2.7/2.2$\times$ faster than FTI-FDet/Light FTI-FDet.

In the future, we plan to apply our method on embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano) to achieve real-time multi-fault detection in the wild, and further enhance accuracy and detection speed.
