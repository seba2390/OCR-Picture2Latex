\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Qualitative Examples}
\label{sec:appendix:failure}
Examples from DiffQG dataset are illustrated in \autoref{fig:examples}. The model outputs (success or failure) from various systems are also provided alongside. 
\input{fig/examples}

\subsection{Annotation Interface}
\label{sec:interface}
Refer \autoref{fig:annotation_p1} and \autoref{fig:annotation_p2} for annotation interface of phase 1 and 2 respectively.

% \subsection{Question generation evaluation on Edited Questions}
% \autoref{tab:qg_edited} presents evaluation of various question generation models over only edited questions. We use the overlapping answer heuristic for factual change detection here. While the performance of all models falls, the gap between the SQuaD-same model used for the annotations and the SQuaD-reseeded model closes with the latter even out-performing on some of the metrics.
