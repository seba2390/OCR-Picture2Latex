\section*{Limitations}
\dataset{} is relatively small, consisting of less than a thousand questions and less than two thousand total examples. This makes us unable to provide a training set, limiting claims we can make about the difficulty of the task. Moreover, summarizing complex edits can have a large space of valid solutions. While using questions conditioned on an answer reduces this space, there's still room for ambiguity.

To make annotation easier, we use a question generation model; however, our goal is also to evaluate question generation models, complicating our story. Finally, most of the baselines we evaluate are some form of T5 \citep{raffel2020exploring} model. It is possible that other model architectures could have solved this task more effectively.
