\caption{Interface for the first phase of annotations, where an annotator chooses one of the five options: Accept/Reject/Edit/Context/Skip. Each example is annotated by two annotators. If both agree, the example is accepted as is or goes to a third annotator for editing. If one of the annotators skips, the third annotator makes the final decision.}
