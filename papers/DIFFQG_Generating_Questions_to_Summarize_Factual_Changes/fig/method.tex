\caption{Methods for factual change detection on \dataset{}: (1) Question similarity (2) Cross-Questioning.  The
QA-equivalence method combines (1) and (2), deciding it is a Change only when both the systems find a Change. (3) Overlapping Answers (4) Language model  that jointly learns the task of factual change detection and discriminating question generation, decoding the discriminating question or a special token indicating no change.}
