\caption{\dataset{} annotation process. Noun phrases are extracted from the target passage and a question generation model seeds initial questions. Annotators decide if the generated questions serve as satisfactory discriminating questions (Accept), must be edited (Context, Edit), or contain no new factual information (Reject). After the first phase, a third annotator resolves indecision (Skip), leaving us with a set of questions and negative examples. If the original two annotators disagree or the third annotator cannot resolve indecision, the example is discarded.}
