In this paper, we propose a subspace representation learning (SRL) framework for few shot image classification task.
It represents an image as a subspace in local CNN feature space, and compares two images by calculating a weighted subspace distance (WSD).
When $K$-shot information is available, we propose two types of class template representation for SRL: a prototypical subspace (PS) and a discriminative subspace (DS).
The estimation of PS and DS can be formulated as an optimization problem in a Stiefel manifold.
The experiment results on three public benchmark datasets show that our SRL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The proposed SRL framework extends the concept of deep metric learning from vector to subspace, and serves as a general tool for modeling the local structure of an image
It can easily be applied to other end-to-end learning network architectures.
Our future work will focus on exploring the applicability of this approach to other tasks and domains.
