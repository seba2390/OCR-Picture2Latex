\caption{\textbf{(a)} Each entry represents the top-1 error rate after 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 1 of the total FLOPS are computed on CIFAR10, 100, and SVHN. $(n,g)$ represents the number of feature layers in each of the three dense blocks. $m=L,N,E$ represents the connection strategies \logdense V1, \nearest, and \evenspace, each of which connects to $1+\log (i)$ layers at depth $i$, but the \logdense V1 has $O(\log(L))$ \pbd while the other two have $O(\frac{L}{\log L})$.\logdense V1 outperforms the others clearly. 
\textbf{(b)} Percentage of the 27 experiments that \logdense is outperformed by \nearest and \evenspace, at each cost location. Lower means \logdense is consistently better.
\textbf{(c)} The average over the 27 comparisons of the relative increase in error rate from those of \logdense by \nearest and \evenspace. Higher means \logdense is better with higher margin.
