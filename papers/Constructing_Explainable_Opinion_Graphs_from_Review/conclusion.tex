\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We present \system, a system that extracts opinions and constructs an explainable opinion graph from reviews.
%

\system{} consists of four components including a novel explanation mining component and an opinion phrase canonicalization component, which we developed to construct opinion graphs from online reviews.
%
Our experimental results  show that our methods significantly perform better than baseline methods in both the task of classifying explanations and canonicalizing opinion phrases by up to $5.4\%$ and, respectively, $12.2\%$.
%
In addition, our user study confirmed that human judges agree with the explanation relationships depicted in our opinion graph in more than 77\% of the cases.
We created labeled datasets for explanation mining and opinion phrase canonicalization tasks and we made these datasets publicly available for future research.
