\begin{abstract}
We present results of optical-UV observations of the 200 Myr old rotation-powered radio 
pulsar J0108$-$1431 with the 
{\sl Hubble Space Telescope}.
We found a putative candidate for the far-UV (FUV) pulsar counterpart, with the flux density $f_\nu = %15\pm 5$ 
9.0\pm 3.2$~nJy at $\lambda = 1528$ \AA.
The pulsar was not detected, however,
at longer wavelengths,
with  $3\sigma$ upper limits of 52, 37, and 87 nJy 
at $\lambda = 4326$, 3355, and 2366 \AA, respectively. 
%We also reanalyzed an observation of the pulsar with the Very Large Telescope (VLT; published by R.\ Mignani and coauthors in 2003 and 2008) and estimated 
%$f_\nu = 44\pm 22$ and $30\pm 14$ in the $U$ and $B$ bands, respectively, and a $3\sigma$ upper limit of 36 nJy in the $V$ band.
Assuming that the pulsar counterpart was indeed detected in FUV, and the previously reported marginal $U$ and $B$ detections with the Very Large Telescope were real, 
%we found that 
the optical-UV spectrum of the
pulsar can be described by a power-law model
%, $f_\nu\propto \nu^\alpha$, with a slope $-0.7 \lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5$\gp{right?} 
with a nearly flat $f_\nu$ spectrum. Similar to younger pulsars detected in the optical, the slope of the nonthermal spectrum steepens in the X-ray range. The pulsar's luminosity in the 1500--6000 \AA\ wavelength range, $L \sim 1.2\times 10^{27} (d/210\,{\rm pc})^2$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponds to a high %optical-UV 
efficiency of conversion of pulsar rotation energy loss rate $\dot {E}$ to the optical-UV radiation, $\eta = L/\dot{E} \sim 
%2.6
%3
%(2$
(1$--$6)\times 10^{-4}$, depending on somewhat uncertain values of distance and spectral slope.
%(d/210\,{\rm pc})^2$.
%\gp{correct efficiencies in the text}
The brightness temperature of the bulk neutron star surface does not exceed 59,000 K ($3\sigma$ upper bound), as seen by a distant observer. If we assume that the FUV flux is dominated by a thermal component,
then the surface temperature can be in the range of 27,000--55,000 K, requiring a heating mechanism to operate in old neutron stars.

Optical and ultraviolet (UV) observations of 
%$\ga 1$~Myr 
old  
rotation-powered 
pulsars (ages $\gtrsim 1$ Myr), 
supplemented by X-ray observations,
%are considered as
are  important to understand advanced stages of  thermal evolution  
of neutron stars (NSs) and study  non-thermal  
emission processes in their magnetospheres. 
So far, only a handful of such pulsars
%old radio pulsars 
have been detected in both X-rays and  optical-UV. 
These are 
%{\bf two ordinary pulsars,} 
the 3 Myr old PSR B1929+10 \citep{1996pavlov,2002mlcw} and 
%(Pavlov et al.\ 1996; Mignani et al.\ 2002), 
the 17 Myr old PSR B0950+08 \citep{1996pavlov,Pavlov2017}, 
%(Pavlov et al.\ 1996; 2017), 
%the 3.8 and 4.9 Gyr-old 
and two a few Gyr old  recycled  millisecond pulsars, PSR J2124$-$3358  \citep{2017rangelov} 
%(Rangelov et al.\ 2017) 
and PSR J0437$-$4715   \citep{2004karg,2012durant},    
%(Kargaltsev et al.\ 2004; Durant et al.\ 2012), 
all are identified in the UV-optical with the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} ({\sl HST}). 
%{\bf \sout{The first millisecond pulsar}
%PSR J2144--3358 is an isolated NS while 
%\sout{the second one}
%PSR J0437--4715 is in a relatively wide binary system with an orbital period of 5.7~days and 
%a very cool, $\sim 4000$~K, white dwarf companion, which cannot contaminate the pulsar flux  in the UV.} 
%Mignani et al.\ (2019) gave an update on the UV identiﬁcation of $\lesssim 1$ Myr-old pulsars.
%\gp{[I would remove the boldfaced text. No need to go into these details in the paper, it is only needed to educate the referee in the response.]}
For both PSR B1929+10 and PSR J2124$-$3358, the spectral data are insufficient to determine the nature of the optical-UV emission, whereas the others 
%feature a clear 
show a Rayleigh-Jeans (R-J) continuum, with an additional power-law (PL) component in PSR B0950+08. 
%Interestingly, in 
In both cases, the inferred temperatures of $\sim 10^5$ K, higher than predicted by NS cooling models 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2004yp}, 
%(e.g., Yakovlev \& Pethicj 2004), 
suggest that some re-heating mechanisms operate in the NS interior. A candidate optical counterpart to the 5 Myr old PSR B1133+16 was found with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), but the identiﬁcation is still uncertain 
\citep{2008zhar,2013zm}.
%(Zharikov et al.\ 2008; Zharikov \& Mignani 2013).

Another old pulsar with a yet unconfirmed optical counterpart is PSR J0108$-$1431. %\citep{Mignani2008}.  
%(Mignani et al.\ 2008). 
This pulsar was discovered by \citet{1994tauris} %Tauris et al.\ (1994) 
%during 
in the Parkes Southern Pulsar Survey \citep{1996manch}.  
%(Manchester et al.\ 1996). 
Its spin period $P = 0.808$ s and period derivative
%\footnote{C

$\dot{P} =

6.51\times  10^{-17}$ s s$^{-1}$ 
(corrected for the Shklovskii effect), imply a rotational energy loss rate $\dot{E} = 5.1\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ 
and surface magnetic field $B_s = 2.3\times 10^{11}$ G. With the characteristic age of 
%166 
196 Myr, PSR J0108$-$1431 is one of the oldest non-recycled isolated radio pulsars known to date. 
%In particular, it 
It lies close to the so-called ``graveyard'' region in the pulsar $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagram, and it is among the faintest radio pulsars, with a 400 MHz luminosity of 0.391 mJy kpc$^2$ for a distance of $210^{+90}_{-50}$ pc, obtained from the Very Large Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) radio parallax \citep{Deller2009}, 
%(Deller et al.\ 2009), 
corrected for the Lutz-Kelker bias \citep{2012verbi}. 
%(Verbiest et al. 2012). 

In the first deep optical observation of the field of PSR J0108--1431 with the VLT,
\citet{Mignani2003} 
%Mignani et al.\ (2003) 
%performed 
noticed a faint brightness enhancement in the $U$ image within
%reported $3\sigma$ upper limits of $m_V\simeq 28$, $m_B\simeq 28.6$, and $m_U=26.4$  
%the first deep optical observations of PSR J0108$-$1431 with the VLT.
%and found a faint object ($m_U = 26.4 \pm 0.3$, $m_B = 27.9\pm 0.5$) compatible with 
 the error ellipse of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) radio position, 
 %at the edge of the image of 
%an elliptical 
projected near the edge of an elongated background galaxy. However, they concluded that most likely it was not a real detection and reported only upper limits in the $V$, $B$ and $U$ filters.

The pulsar position measured by the {\sl Chandra X-ray Observatory} 
by \citet{2009pavlov}
% (Pavlov et al.\ 2009) 
 implied a significant proper motion, which, extrapolated to the epoch of the VLT observations, matched the position of the 
%object detected 
enhancement noticed by  \citet{Mignani2003}. It prompted \citet{Mignani2008}
%Mignani et al.\ (2008) 
to propose that the pulsar counterpart had probably been detected with the VLT, with magnitudes $U=26.4\pm 0.3$, $B=27.9\pm 0.5$, $V > 27.8$.
The improved VLBI proper motion,  
%($169 \pm 1.7$  
$170.0\pm 1.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ \citep{Deller2009}, made the proposed identification 
%(Mignani et al.\ 2008) 
more robust, with a chance positional coincidence probability of $\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$  \citep{Mignani2011}.  
%(Mignani et al.\ 2011). 
The optical spectrum of the PSR J0108--1431 candidate counterpart is poorly defined, although the $U$ and $B$ fluxes are compatible with a $\sim 2.3 \times 10^5$ K R-J spectrum, for the NS radius of 13 km and 210 pc distance. 

The PSR J0108$-$1431 X-ray identification with {\sl Chandra} by 
\citet{2009pavlov} %{%Pavlov et al.\ 2009) 
has been confirmed by the detection of X-ray pulsations with {\sl XMM-Newton} \citep{Posselt2012}. 
%(Posselt et al. 2012). 
The X-ray spectrum is best fitted by a PL with a (fixed) photon index $\Gamma  = 2$ and a blackbody (BB) with temperature 
%$kT = 0.11^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ keV 
1.28$^{+0.35}_{-0.12}\times 10^6$~K and effective radius 
%of the emitting area of
$R= 43^{+16}_{-9} d_{210}$ m, where $d_{210}$ is the pulsar distance in units of 210 pc, with a hydrogen column density $N_H=2.3^{+2.4}_{-2.2}\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$.

The proposed optical identification of PSR J0108--1431, however, has never been confirmed. Follow-up VLT observations in 2009 with about two times larger total exposures were not conclusive 
because of an almost twice worse seeing  of 0\farcs8 -- 1\farcs0 \citep{Mignani2011},  
as compared to  $\approx$0\farcs5 
in previous  observations in 2000 %non-optimal sky conditions 
 \citep{Mignani2003}.  The counterpart was not detected at the expected new position  of the pulsar accounting for its proper motion, while its  brightness limits,  $U\ga 26.5$, $B\ga 27.2$, were consistent with the tentative detection reported  by \citet{Mignani2008}. 
%(Mignani et al.\ 2011). 
%PSR J0108$−$1431 has never been re-observed in the optical since then2. Therefore, 
To verify the putative VLT identification, measure the optical-UV spectrum of this pulsar, and constrain the surface temperature of the very old NS, 
we carried out new observations with the {\sl HST}. We describe the {\sl HST} observations in Section 2 and astrometry of the {\sl HST} images in Section 3.
Photometry of the candidate pulsar counterpart in the {\sl HST} and VLT data is reported in Section 4.
In Section 5 we discuss spectral fits of the optical-UV data, compare them with the X-ray spectrum, and discuss constraints on the NS surface temperature. Conclusions from our analysis are presented in Section 6.
%to conﬁrm the pulsar identiﬁcation and characterize its spectrum in the optical-UV. This paper is divided as follows: observations and data analysis are described in Section 2, with the results presented and discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.

The PSR J0108--1431 field was observed with the {\sl HST} in 2016 August 
(program \#14249, PI Mignani) using the Ultraviolet-Visible (UVIS) channel of the Wide Field 
Camera 3 (WFC3; 6 {\sl HST} orbits) 
and the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS; 2 {\sl HST} orbits). 
The WFC3/UVIS imaging was carried out with the F438W, F336W and F225W broad-band filters,
while the F140LP long-pass filter was used with the ACS/SBC. 
The log of the observations and the pivot wavelengths of the filters are presented in 
Table~\ref{tab:obs}. 
For each filter, the total integration time  was split 
into shorter exposures distributed over two {\sl HST} 
orbits. 
The WFC3/UVIS exposures were taken in the ACCUM mode, applying a four-point box dither pattern 
in each orbit. 
The UVIS2-C1K1C-CTE aperture was used to place the
pulsar close to a readout amplifier and minimize the CCD charge
transfer efficiency (CTE) losses, as advised in the WFC3
Instrument Handbook\footnote{
See \url{https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/display/WFC3IHB.}}. The data were reduced
and flux-calibrated through the CALWF3 pipeline, which 
also applies the image de-dithering, geometric distortion and CTE corrections,
cosmic-ray filtering, and stacking. For the ACS/SBC,  a single exposure  was taken in the ACCUM 
mode during each orbit. 
The data were processed through the CALACS  pipeline  including the flux-calibration and  
geometric distortion correction. The SBC images are not affected by
cosmic rays and CTE. 
The data for two {\sl HST} orbits obtained for each filter (see Table~\ref{tab:obs}) 
were combined to produce resulting images. However, the aperture door was closed during second ACS/SBC orbit
(2900 s) 
because the Fine Guidance Sensors failed to acquire the guide stars.
Since this orbit provided no science data,
only the first ASC/SBC orbit is included in Table~\ref{tab:obs}.

\section{Astrometry}
\label{astrom}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
Precise  astrometric referencing is crucial for searching the pulsar counterpart by its positional coincidence 
with the radio pulsar.  
We used the {\sl Gaia} DR2 Catalog \citep{Lindegren2018} and the IRAF tasks {\tt imcentroid} and {\tt ccmap }
to obtain astrometric solutions.   
Five catalogued objects fall within the UVIS field of view (FoV) of about $162\asec \times 162\asec$ %with the 
(pixel scale 
%0\farcs 0.0396 
of 39.6 mas was chosen in drizzling). %  \gp{Are you sure in this value? I thought that usual a round number, like 40 mas, is chosen in drizzling.}).
%, which is significantly larger than the $\approx 31\asec\times 34\asec$ SBC FoV with the pixel scale after  
%drizzling of 0\farcs025\footnote{For the UVIS and SBC, the original pixel scales are 
%about $40\times 40$  and $31\times 34$ mas, respectively.}. 
These objects are best detected in the F438W image  which we use
as a primary reference image for SBC astrometry
(SBC FoV $\approx 31 \asec \times 34 \asec$; pixel scale 25 mas after drizzling\footnote{For the UVIS and SBC, the original pixel scales are 
about $40\times 40$  and $31\times 34$ mas, respectively.}). 
The {\sl Gaia} objects are marked and numerated 
in this image shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:1}; 
their coordinates and proper motion (p.m.) components $\mu_{\alpha}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$  
are listed in  
Table~\ref{tab:ref-stars}.
%Objects 1, 2, and 3 are located within $25''$ from the pulsar position. 
Object 2 looks like an elliptical galaxy and shows no p.m. 
%Two other objects are stars with p.m.\ of about 5 and 7 mas yr$^{-1}$.
%Objects 4 and 5, imaged on the detector chip that does not contain the pulsar,
%have relatively large p.m., about 31 and 47 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. 

We used the coordinates and p.m.\ values for the four stars in Table~\ref{tab:ref-stars} to calculate their coordinates at the epoch of the UVIS observations, MJD 57608, for further astrometry. To increase the number of reference objects, we also used the galaxy (object 2). Thanks to its regular (elliptical) shape, the uncertainty of its position in the F438W image is reasonably small, about $2.4$ mas.
%comparable to the typical {\sl Gaia} DR2 Catalog uncertainty of $\la 2$~mas,  including the objects with $G$ magnitudes as large as $\approx 21$\footnote{See the {\sl Gaia} data release documentation:  \url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2}.}. 
%The centroiding uncertainties for the stellar objects  are  even smaller, 0.2--0.9 mas. 
The total (stars plus galaxy) root-mean-square ({\sl rms}) centroid radial uncertainty is 1.9 mas. According to Table~\ref{tab:ref-stars}, the {\tt rms} of the {\sl Gaia} radial uncertainty of the  reference objects is 1.3 mas. The p.m.\ corrections lead to an additional radial uncertainty of 1.3 mas.
%resulting in the total {\tt rms} of 1.8 mas at the epoch of the UVIS observations. 
%It is comparable with the centroiding  {\tt rms}. 
Performing the astrometric fit with the {\tt ccmap}, 
%which include the frame shift, rotation, and scale factor, 
we obtained formal {\tt rms} 
residuals of 0.7 mas for the right ascension (RA) 
and 2.3 mas for the declination (Decl). 
An additional uncertainty of about 2 mas is associated with the 
WFC3/UVIS geometric distortion correction \citep{Kozhurina-Platais2015}. 
As a result, combining all the uncertainties in quadrature,  we  got the final radial uncertainty of 4 mas (0.1 pixels) for astrometric referencing of the F438W image.

Using the same reference objects for 
the F336W image yields 
%the {\sl rms} fit residuals of $0.8$ mas for RA and $3.7$ mas for Decl, and   
the net radial astrometric uncertainty 
of 7 mas. 
For the F225W image, the {\sl rms} fit 
residuals are 23 mas 
for RA and 13 mas for Decl, 
and the net radial astrometric 
uncertainty is 49 mas. 
The degradation of the referencing accuracy, 
as compared 
to the F438W image, is caused by a significant 
brightness  decrease of the objects   
in the images.

%The SBC/F140LP image (Figure~\ref{fig:2})  
%contains only two of the 
%{\sl Gaia} sources 
%used  for the UVIS astrometry. 
%These are the galaxy (object 2), whose  position becomes much less certain in this image,
%and star 3, 
%which is much fainter in the FUV band. However, this image  also contains three sources with counterparts in the F438W image: a spiral galaxy
%seen edge-on (within the box in Figure~\ref{fig:1}) 
%and more compact  objects 6 and 7. 
%Comparison of their positions, especially 
%of the star 3, which is the only point source 
%in the F140LP FoV, with the well defined positions in the F438W  image,  reveals 
%offsets of 1\farcs32  in RA and 0\farcs39 in Decl.

%divided by the star signal-to-noise ratio $\rm S/N \approx 3$,}
%we conservatively estimate  the  error of this alignment to be 0\farcs2 and consider this value as the resulting  radial astrometric uncertainty of the F140LP image.
 An accurate alignment of the F140LP and F438W images is not possible with a standard approach because 
three of the only four common objects (marked in Figure~\ref{fig:2}) are extended, with poorly defined positions in the F140LP image. 
The only common point source is star 3, which, however, becomes much fainter in the F140LP band. We used this star 
for an initial estimate of the shifts between the F140LP and F438W images, and found offsets of 1\farcs3  in R.A.\ and 0\farcs4 in Decl.
%\gp{If you want to use the (questionable) uncertainty estimate below, 0\farcs1, then better write the offsets as 1\farcs3 and 0\farcs4 (and even without that estimate such rounding is reasonable here).} 
Their uncertainties  are dominated by the  position error of $\approx$30 mas of star 3 in 
the F140LP image. It was conservatively        
estimated  \citep[see, e.g,][]{1995ApJSNeuschaefer}    %$\approx 0\farcs03$ 
 as FWHM of the SBC point spread function (PSF)   
of $\approx 0\farcs2$ \citep{Avila2016} divided by the signal-to-noise ratio, $S/N\approx 3$, of the star 
in the  image times $\sqrt{8\ln 2} = 2.35$. The {\tt imcentroid} task yields  a similar value.
%\footnote{\sout{See \url{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/356f/a45f97f9f22ca836ce35e8d0c1389204d984.pdf} \gp{The ref is actually in the reference list in a readable form}}}
%\gp{It would be better to refer to Avila \& Chiaberge 2016 in the text (no need for the footnote). More important, I think the FWHM is $\approx 0\farcs2$, not 0\farcs3. It follows from Table 2 in AC16, with account for the fact that  the half-maximum for a 2D Gaussian distribution corresponds to the radius at which the EEF = 1/2. For F140LP EEF = 0.51 at $r=0\farcs1$; `full width' is about $2r$, etc. divided by the signal-to-noise ratio $S/N\approx 3$ of star 3 in the F140LP image.} 
%\gp{That is, the uncertainty is 0\farcs06?} \yus{Yes.}
Then we corrected the WCS values in the header of the SBC fits file 
applying the measured offsets and used the extended objects, particularly the nearby spiral galaxy seen edge-on,
that shows a similar structure in both images, to check the shifts and reveal possible signatures of rotation between the two frames.  
A similar approach was applied by \cite{2002zhar} to align the UV and optical frames for PSR B0950$+$08. Overlaying the frames (see Figure~\ref{fig:2}), we found no signs of additional shifts or
%and the 
rotation within the  uncertainty of 0\farcs2 
%the above offsets rounded to 0\farcs1. %\old{conservative referencing  uncertainty of 0\farcs2.} 
%\yus{It might be useful to overlay the spiral galaxy contour from F438W (or from F438+F338) to F140 in Fig. 2?} 
%\gp{This 0\farcs2 just appeared out of the blue (from nowhere). Also ``rotation within the uncertainty of 0\farcs2'' does not make much sense to me.}
%\yus{Yes, actually, we have only one  semi-quantitative  estimate,  0\farcs1, confirmed by the overlay. I would save it as the final one,
%anyway the FUV source sits within the 
%0\farcs1 circle as well.}
and concluded that the SBC astrometric referencing is confident within this uncertainty.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Possible pulsar counterpart}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The {\sl HST} images of the pulsar field in all the used filters are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:3}. 
In the SBC/F140LP image (Figure~\ref{fig:2})   
%({\sl top-left panel} of Figure~\ref{fig:3}), within the dashed box region 
we found a faint point-like source with coordinates  
RA = 01\h08\m08\fs403(14) and  
Decl = $-$14\degs31\amin51\farcs66(20),    
 consistent with the expected  radio pulsar  
coordinates (see 4th row in Table~\ref{tab:psr-positions}).
A zoomed-in region around this source is shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:4}, which 
clearly demonstrates  that  the source is located 
within the circle  with the radius 
of 0\farcs2 corresponding to the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of the pulsar radio position in this image. 

%To verify that the source is not a detector artifact, 
%we inspected the raw image where we found only one obvious artifact, with a count rate of 2.5 counts s$^{-1}$,
%at the detector coordinates $x=56$ pix, $y=282$ pix,
%far away from the pulsar position at $x=495$ pix, $y=446$ pix.
%This detector feature is known as a bright spot\footnote{See \url{ http://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/acs/performance/anomalies-and-artifacts}.}.  
%We also inspected the respective pulsar position on the detector  using other archival SBC observations of the same program 
%(the target was outside the FoV in those observations) carried out in 2015 with the same 
%filter. We did not find any detector artifacts around $x=495$ pix, $y=446$ pix.
%In the {\sl left panel} of Figure \ref{fig:5}, we present     
%a fragment of the F140LP frame binned 
%by $4\times4$ pixels, where the detected source is marked by the circle %({\sl left panel}),   
%and its spatial  profile is shown in the {\sl right panel}.  
%The profile looks like a stellar one.
%Star 3 (marked in Figures~\ref{fig:1} and \ref{fig:2}), certainly a real object,
%used for astrometry 
%in Section~\ref{astrom}, 
%has similar brightness and spatial profile in the SBC image. 
%This is an additional argument for the detected count excess to be a real source as well. 
%Below we will  consider it as a possible pulsar counterpart.

\subsection{Photometry of the FUV counterpart candidate}

%For the SBC/F140LP  photometry of the pulsar  counterpart candidate, we followed the approach 
%described by \cite{Pavlov2017}. 
To find an optimal source aperture for the SBC/F140LP photometry of the pulsar counterpart candidate,
we calculated the signal-to-noise ratio 
${\rm S/N}$ as a function of  radius of 
circular aperture centered at the brightest source pixel in the unbinned image using 
%Using 
the background extracted from the annulus around the same center with inner and outer radii of 20 %35  
and 50 %59 
pixels 
(area $A_b=4.12$ %$ $A_b=4.43
arcsec$^2$). 
We found the maximum S/N = 2.7 in the aperture 
of 8 pixels (0\farcs2) radius
%\footnote{\bf Note that this aperture radius is close the FWHM of a halo around a point source imaged with SBC; see Section 5.6 of the ACS Instrument Handbook; \url{https://www.stsci.edu/itt/APT_help/ACS_Cycle21/c05_imaging7.html}.}
(area $A_s=0.126$ arcsec$^2$). This aperture was selected as the optimal one. 
%provides a maximal ${\rm S/N} \approx 2.9$. The aperture area is $A_s=0.567$ arcsec$^2$. 
%The value of the maximal S/N slightly depends on 
%We used two methods to measure the background (see Table \ref{tab:photometry-mod}). In first method we extracted the background  from the annulus of 35 pix and 59 pix inner and outer radii, respectively 
%its area is 
%(area $A_b=4.43$ arcsec$^2$).
%, and the number of source counts in the source aperture and its uncertainty were estimated as $N_s=N_t-(A_s/A_b)N_b$ and $\delta N_s = [N_t+N_b(A_s/A_b)^2]^{1/2}$, where $N_t$ is the total number of counts
%in the source aperture, $N_b$ is the number of counts in the annulus. 
%In second method we measured the count rates in a set of 1000 circular background regions with 
%the same radius of 
%$r=17$ pix 
%(0/farcs425) as that of the source aperture; the circles were 
%randomly placed in the annulus with 25 and 65 pixels inner and outer radii, and found the mean and standard deviation, $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bgd}$ of the background count rate.
%As seen from Figure \ref{fig:5}, where the image is binned by $4\times4$ pixels for a more clear   presentation, 
%this aperture  encapsulates a major fraction of the source flux.   
According to Table 2 in \citet{Avila2016}, 
it contains the fraction $\phi_E\approx 0.63$ of the total number of point source counts. 
%{\bf For  low ${\rm S/N}$ SBC point-like sources, optimal apertures were claimed to be $\la$10 pixels \citep[e.g.,][]{Pavlov2017,2017rangelov}. Our aperture is somewhat larger, which might  
%indicate the presence of an unresolved faint  diffusive structure around the pulsar. On the other hand, carefully inspecting the SBC/F140LP data for PSR B0950$+$08 we found that a similar aperture of about 15 pixels appears to be optimal for the low ${\rm S/N}$ UV counterpart of this pulsar, while smaller apertures leads to $\sim$10\% formal underestimation of the aperture corrected counterpart flux. It is also possible that provided SBC aperture corrections for small apertures are less certain than for larger ones. We thus selected 17 pixel aperture for our counterpart candidate as the most optimal assuming that it may contain a 10\% flux contribution from a possible nebula around it. }
%\sout{\citep{Avila2016}.}

%We used the background values found with the two methods to estimate the source count rate, the flux density at the pivot wavelength, and their errors (see the note to Table \ref{tab:photometry-mod}). The flux densities found with the two methods,
%$f_\nu = 14.7\pm 5.1$ and $14.0\pm 4.1$ nJy, coincide 
%within the uncertainties; they correspond to ${\rm S/N} = 2.9$ and 3.4, respectively. In the following estimates we will use the former value as more conservative.
 

%As seen from Figure \ref{fig:5},  
%the chosen aperture  encapsulates 
%a major fraction of the source flux.   
%According to the  SBC point spread function
%(PSF) presented by \citet{Avila2016}, this aperture contains $\phi_E\approx 0.77$ of the total number of point source counts.
%
%The aperture and annulus count numbers, $N_t$ and $N_b$, the aperture-corrected source count rate $C_s$,
%and the corresponding flux density $f_\nu$ at the pivot wavelength $\lambda_{\rm piv}=  1528$ \AA\
%are presented in the first line of Table~\ref{tab:photometry-mod}. 
%To convert the count rate to the flux density, we took into account the recent correction of SBC sensitivity, such that 
%the flux density at a given count rate is about 0.77 of the previously adopted value \citep{Avila2019}.
%We also used another method to measure the background contribution and the source flux.
Following \citet{Guillot2019}, we estimated the mean background $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ and its standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm bgd}$
%$\overline{C}_{\rm bgd} =8.7$ cnts/ks and its standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm bgd}=1.2$ cnts/ks 
%[[why different numbers of significant digits? 1.19 $\to$ 1.2?]] 
for a set of 1000 circular background  
regions of size $r_{\rm extr}$=0\farcs2 (8 pixels, the same as of the source aperture), randomly 
placed in the annulus. % of 20 pix  
%\gp{[Isn't 17 pix too small (close to the the source center)?]}
%and 50 pix inner and outer radii
%respectively, 
%around the pulsar position. 
%The results are presented in  
%second line of 
%Table \ref{tab:photometry-mod}. %Table~\ref{tab:photometry2}. %Comparing them with those in Table~\ref{tab:photometry} we see that within errors both approaches  give consistent flux densities. Below we use a more conservative  flux density from  Table~\ref{tab:photometry}.
%The flux density $f_\nu = 9.0\pm 3.2$ nJy is virtually the same as $14.7\pm 5.1$ found with the first method.
%but S/N is slightly higher (3.4 vs.\ 2.9).
To convert the count rate to the flux density, we took into account the recent correction of the SBC sensitivity, such that 
the flux density at a given count rate is about 0.77 of the previously adopted value \citep{Avila2019}.
The results are presented in  
%second line of 
Table \ref{tab:photometry-mod}. 
%In the following we will use 
%a more conservative 
%flux density range rounded to $9\pm 3$~nJy.
%found by the first method (rounded to $9\pm 3$~nJy). 

%{\bf Possible contribution of the putative UV nebula around the pulsar lies within the rounded uncertainty.}    

%Subtracting 
%this $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ 
%the mean background count rate from the measured count rate in the source aperture,
%$C_{\rm pos}=N_{\rm tot}/t_{\rm exp} =15.4$ cnts/ks, 
%we obtain $C_{\rm pos}-\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}=6.7$ cnts/ks,
%which corresponds to $N_s=18.8$ source counts in the source aperture.
%The uncertainty of $N_s$ is $[(\sigma_{\rm bgd}\times t_{\rm exp})^2 + N_s]^{1/2}
%((1.19\times 2.8)^2 + 18.2)^{1/2} 
%= 5.5$ cnts, which corresponds to the ${\rm S/N} = 3.4$, aperture-corrected $C_s=8.7\pm 2.6$ cnts/ks, and $f_\nu = C_s {\cal P}_\nu = 14.0\pm 4.1$ nJy.
%\gp{[[I am not sure the both methods should indeed be presented in the paper. And it is not clear why the first method ``deserves'' a separate table while the second one does not. Maybe to find a way to put both methods in one table? Or to retain only the second method because it is the same as used for the upper bound estimate below?]]}

As the putative pulsar counterpart %in the F140LP band 
is detected at only about $3\sigma$ level, we cannot rule out that the count 
rate excess at the pulsar position is caused by some fluctuation.
In this case, one can estimate the flux density upper bound following \citet{Kashyap2010} and \citet{Guillot2019}.
We define the upper bounds $C_{\rm ub}$ on the pulsar count rate as $C_{\rm ub}=C_{\rm pos}-\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}+n\sigma_{\rm bgd}$,
where 
$C_{\rm pos}$ is the measured count rate at the position of the pulsar, $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bkg}$ are defined above (see also 
%the note to 
Table \ref{tab:photometry-mod}),
%are the mean 
%and standard deviation of the background count rate, and 
and $n$ determines the significance level of the upper bound\footnote{This 
definition of $C_{\rm ub}$ is applicable at $C_{\rm pos} \geq \overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$, which is fulfilled 
in our case.}.
%and the other terms are defined (and their values reported) in the %preceding paragraph. 
%We 
%choose $n=3$ and therefore 
%report 
The resulting 3$\sigma$ upper bounds %on the count rates and flux densities 
are 
%We obtain
%$C_{\rm pos}=15.4$ cts/ks,
%$\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}=8.9$ cts/ks,
%$\sigma_{\rm bgd}=1.19$ cts/ks,
$C_{\rm ub}=5.5$ cts/ks and  
$f_\nu^{\rm ub} = 14$ nJy.
%{\bf They are marginally consistent with the above  measurements  assuming the detection  of the real source.}
%under the hypothesis of detection of the real source   accounting for its  1$\sigma$ uncertainty.



%They are consistent with the measured source values accounting for their 1$\sigma$ uncertainties.  

%If we assume real detection and measure the background using a set of 1000 circles, 
%\gp{Okay. I think this exercise demonstrated stability of the result w.r.t. method of bgd measurement, and the result itself deserves presenting it in the paper (at the beginning of this section), together with (or even instead of?) the result obtained %with the more traditional method.}

%For a consistency check, we employed the recent version (ver.\ 28.1) of the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) for the ACS/SBC. Using the 
%source flux density of 14 nJy, and $A_s$ and $t_{\rm exp}$ from Table~\ref{tab:photometry}, we got an expected net source count number $N_s\approx 18.3$   
%and S/N in the range of 1.8--4.2. 
%\gp{[[Why such a scatter of S/N? The different values correspond to which difference in the input parameters?]]} These values are consistent with the measured ones.
%with a mean value of $\approx 3$. These values are fully consistent with the measured ones (see Table~\ref{tab:photometry}).
%and S/N in the range of 1.8--4.3\yus{insert exact ETC value?}, with a mean value of $\approx 3$. These values are fully consistent with the measured ones (see Table~\ref{tab:photometry}).

\subsection{UVIS upper bounds and VLT observations of PSR J0108-1431 \label{UVIS+VLT}}

The counterpart candidate is not detected in the UVIS images.
%\footnote{{\bf We do not show F336W and F225W images as they are generally similar to that 
%of F438W presented in Figure~\ref{fig:1}.}}. 
%(Figure~\ref{fig:3}). %this is a blue object,
%\gp{The word `blue' may be misleading here -- we see something in FUV but nothing in the blue filter. Is there another way to make the same point? Maybe just remove ``implying ...''?}
%as expected for a pulsar. 
%In all the bands a relatively bright spiral galaxy seen edge-on is visible northwest of the pulsar.
%(Figure~\ref{fig:3}). 
%In the F438W image 
%there are also two faint objects, A and B, in the immediate pulsar vicinity, likely background galaxies ({\sl bottom-right panel} of Figure~\ref{fig:3}).  
%Both the A and B  objects and the spiral galaxy were previously detected  in a deep  $B$-band image obtained with the VLT FORS1 instrument in 2000 July 31 \citep{Mignani2003}.
%In the UVIS images we did not detect any source 
%at the calculated pulsar position (Figure ~\ref{fig:3}). 
%Therefore, we calculated bounds on the minimum detectable fluxes at the pulsar position 
%for each of the {\sl HST} filters. 
% Following \citet{Kashyap2010} and \citet{Guillot2019},
%We define 
Therefore, we calculated the upper bounds on the pulsar count rate and flux density  for each of the UVIS filters  using the same approach as for the F140LP filter.
%(see Table~\ref{tab:upperbounds}).
%(Table~\ref{tab:upperbounds}).
%$C_{\rm ub}$ on the pulsar count rate 
%as $C_{\rm ub}=C_{\rm pos}-\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}+n\sigma_{\rm bgd}$,
%\citep{Guillot2019}, 
%where $C_{\rm pos}$ is the measured count rate 
%at the position of the pulsar, $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ 
%and $\sigma_{\rm bkg}$ are the mean 
%and  standard deviation of the background count rate, 
%and $n$ determines the significance of 
%the upper bound\footnote{This 
% definition of $C_{\rm ub}$ is applicable at 
% $C_{\rm pos} \geq \overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$, which is fulfilled 
%in our case.}. 
% We choose $n=3$ and therefore report 3$\sigma$ upper 
%bounds on the count rates and 
%flux densities.
The sizes of the extraction regions used to measure $C_{\rm pos}$ were chosen by identifying in each image 
the extraction radius that maximizes  $\rm S/N$ 
for a point source (star). 
%For instance, for the F438W image the optimal extraction radius is $r_{\rm extr}$ = 0\farcs14 (3.5 pixels). 
%It corresponds to the enclosed energy fraction $\phi_{E}=0.81$.
For each of the filters, we estimated $\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bgd}$ from a set of 1000 circular background  
regions of size $r_{\rm extr}$, randomly selected 
in the 
%half ring 
annulus of 10 pixels 
%\gp{[[Isn't 3 pix too small?]]}
and 30 pixels inner and outer radii 
%respectively, 
around the pulsar position. % where   object $A$ was excluded. 
%\gp{in how large area?}
%We obtained the sum of counts in each of these regions and calculate the mean
%$\overline{C}_{\rm bgd}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm bgd}$ needed to obtain 
These quantities, together with $C_{\rm ub}$ and the corresponding flux densities corrected for the finite extraction aperture, $f_\nu^{\rm ub} = C_{\rm ub} {\cal P}_\nu \phi_E^{-1}$, are presented in Table~\ref{tab:upperbounds} where we also show the $1\sigma$ flux density  upper bounds used in spectral fits (Section 5.2).


%Using the seeing-limited VLT FORS1 observations taken in 2000 July-August, \citet{Mignani2008} 
%reported a possible pulsar counterpart tentatively   detected in the $U$ and $B$ (but not $V$) bands 
%near the northern edge of
%in close vicinity to 
%the spiral galaxy at the brightness level of $U=26.4\pm 0.3$ and $B=27.9\pm 0.5$.
%\gp{%It would be useful to show that position in Fig 3, e.g. as a small yellow cross. 
%To my eye, the backward extrapolation of the psr trajectory goes far from that position; is it because of p.m. uncertainties? 
%Could p.m. uncertainties be also shown in Fig 3 - e.g. as two straight lines passing through the position at the reference epoch?}

We also do not detect any object in any of the {\sl HST} bands  at the
position where \citet{Mignani2008} found a possible pulsar counterpart in the VLT $U$ and $B$  bands near the northern edge of the spiral galaxy.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For the {\sl HST}--VLT consistency check, we re-reduced  the VLT $UBV$  data %taken from the ESO-archive 
using  the recent version of the  
ESO recipe execution tool EsoRex 3.13.12\footnote{\url{https://www.eso.org/sci/software/cpl/esorex.html}}. To maximize the spatial resolution and better resolve the putative counterpart from the  galaxy, we selected six best-seeing 900 s  exposures of eight available in $B$, three 1800 s exposures of five available in $U$, and all twelve  %six 
600 s exposures %of twelve 
in $V$\footnote{For the VLT observation log, see \citet{Mignani2003}.}. This  resulted in an extremely good seeing on the stacked images of 0\farcs56 in the $U$ and $B$ bands and 0\farcs54 in the $V$ band. 
%A few obvious cosmic ray hits  retained in the published images were cleaned.     

The VLT astrometric solution was also revised using 11 relatively bright unsaturated {\sl Gaia} stars, 
with account for their p.m.\ shifts for  the epoch of the VLT observations.  This   
resulted in a 30 mas uncertainty  of the WCS  referencing of all images  in both coordinates, which is significantly better than the previous  astrometric %accuracy 
precision of 190 mas %0\farcs19 
based on the GSC-II catalog \citep{Mignani2008}. 
%All this 
The more precise astrometry  
%allowed us to confirm 
supports the assumption that the object detected with the VLT 
%counterpart candidate 
at a $2\sigma$ significance  in the $U$ and $B$ bands is the counterpart candidate.
%and its absence in the V band.

At the same time, bright structures of the spiral galaxy are better resolved with the {\sl HST}.  

Photometric calibration of the VLT data was carried out using Landolt's standards PG1323--086, PG0231+051 and PG2331+055, observed at the same nights as the target; it resulted in the following  magnitude zero-points for the stacked images: $Z_U=25.08\pm0.04$,  $Z_B=27.55\pm0.05$ and $Z_V=28.00\pm0.01$,  
%
%$Z_U=25.076\pm0.034$,  $Z_B=27.553\pm0.048$ and $Z_V=28.00\pm0.01$, 
calculated for the fluxes in units of the CCD electron rate.  
%Using the mean atmosphere extinction coefficients $k_U=0.47\pm 0.01$,  $k_B=0.262\pm 0.001$ and $k_V=0.124\pm 0.007$ mag measured 
%for the VLT site at that epoch, 
%We obtained the following  magnitude zero-points for the stacked images: $Z_U=25.076\pm0.034$,  $Z_B=27.553\pm0.048$ and $Z_V=28.00\pm0.01$ calculated for the fluxes in units of the CCD electron rate.

\subsection{Extinction towards PSR J0108--1431}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The pulsar's  Galactic coordinates are $l= 140\fdg93$, $b=-76\fdg82$. 
%According to \citet{2011schlaf}, the total Galactic extinction toward J0108
%in this direction 
%is $A_V= 0.069$,
%\gp{no errors?}
%resulting in 
%corresponding to the 
%color excess  $E(B-V)=0.022$ (assuming $R_V=3.1$). The most recent Galactic 3D extinction map by \citet{Green2018} provides  a similar value, $E(B-V)=0.03 \pm 0.02$. The color excess grows with distance up to this value %with the  distance up to 
%at 430 pc and then remains  constant.
%Thus, 430 pc may indicate  the distance to the Galactic % gaseous \gp{Why gaseous? remove?} 
%disk edge in 
%this direction. 
%The distance to the pulsar based on the parallax measurements \citep{Deller2009}, corrected for the Lutz-Kelker bias \citep{2012verbi},  is $d=210^{+90}_{-50}$~pc. %\citep{2012verbi}.
%Within the uncertainty of this  distance 
According to the Galactic 3D extinction map by \citet{Green2018},
the color excess $E(B-V)$ varies between 0.00 and 0.04 within the uncertainty of the distance to the pulsar, %and gives a value of 
and $E(B-V)=0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ 
%\gp{why ``median''?}
for  $d=210$ pc.  
%\gp{I stopped here.}

The $E(B-V)$ value is correlated  %can be
%transformed  to the absorption 
with the %\sout{\bf X-ray absorbing} 
effective hydrogen column density $N_{\rm H}$
%the main parameter of the 
for X-ray photoelectric absorption models. 
Applying the empirical relation $N_{\rm H}=(0.7\pm0.1) \times 10^{22} E(B-V)$~cm$^{-2}$, obtained by \citet{Watson2011} for the Galaxy using observations of X-ray afterglows of a large number of $\gamma$-ray bursts, we 
%obtain 
expect $N_{\rm H}=1.4^{+1.8}_{-0.8}\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$.



Alternatively, $N_{\rm H}$
%the hydrogen column density 
can be estimated 
using the pulsar's dispersion measure, ${\rm DM} = 2.38$ pc\,cm$^{-3}$ and the correlation between  ${\rm DM}$ and $N_{\rm H}$ obtained by \citet{He2013}, 
 $N_{\rm H}= 0.30^{+0.13}_{-0.09} \times 10^{20} {\rm DM}$~cm$^{-2}$, which yields 
$N_{\rm H}=0.71^{+0.31}_{-0.21}\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$, in 
%accord 
agreement with the value derived from $E(B-V)$. 
This also overlaps with the $N_{\rm H}$ range of $(0.3-0.8)\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ at $d=210$ pc obtained from 
the study of interstellar NaD absorption lines \citep{posselt2007,posselt2008}. 

Finally, the 
%rotation 
phase-integrated X-ray spectrum 
of the pulsar obtained with \textit{XMM-Newton} is 
most plausibly described by the absorbed power 
law (PL) plus blackbody (BB) model with $N_{\rm H} = 2.3^{+2.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ \citep{Posselt2012,Arumugasamy2019}. The latter value is very uncertain but  consistent with the above estimates.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
%\subsubsection{Optical-UV spectral energy distribution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Optical-UV emission from a rotation powered pulsar generally consists of two components, thermal and nonthermal. The nonthermal component, produced by relativistic particles in the pulsar magnetosphere, is usually described by a power-law (PL) model, $f_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$, while the spectrum of the thermal component, emitted from the %neutron star 
NS surface, is close to a blackbody spectrum \citep{2011mignani}. In middle-aged %{\bf \sout{(10--100~kyr)}
(0.1--1~Myr) and moderately 
old (1--10~Myr) pulsars the nonthermal component dominates in the optical 
while the thermal component dominates in FUV 
\citep[e.g.,][]{2001kopts,2004zhar,2006shib,Kargaltsev2007, Pavlov2017},
%\gp{I would remove Zyuzin et al -- Vela is not a middle-aged pulsar (although shows some properties of it). You may add Koptsevich et al 2001 instead.}
%\sout{while the thermal component dominates in FUV} 
%\citep[e.g.,][]{Kargaltsev2007, Pavlov2017}.
%\gp{I see no point in separating the references. Please fix the parentheses...}
However, we know too little about optical-UV emissions of pulsars as old as PSR J0108--1431; the only other very old pulsar, J2144--3933 with the age of 300 Myr,
observed in the optical-UV, was not detected \citep{Guillot2019}. Therefore, we should explore various options and their connection with the results 
in X-rays where spectra of very old pulsars, including PSR J0108--1431,  
typically show only the PL component of the NS magnetosphere origin and a thermal component 
from small hot  spots  at the NS surface near magnetic pole regions  heated by relativistic particles generated 
in its magnetosphere.

Assuming both optical ($B$ and $U$) and FUV (F140LP) detections were real, we can fit the unabsorbed flux density points with a %single power law (PL): 
PL model: $f_\nu = f_0 (\nu/\nu_0)^\alpha$, where we choose the reference frequency $\nu_0 = 1\times 10^{15}$ Hz.
%(corresponding to $\lambda_0=3000$ \AA). 
%
%The optical-UV SEDs of ordinary rotation powered pulsars are mostly dominated by nonthermal emission created by relativistic particles in their magnetospheres \citep[e.g.,][]{Mignani2011}. It typically   described by the single  
%PL spectral model $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\alpha}$. Therefore,  assuming that we detected the pulsar in the $UB$ and F140LP bands, it is natural to try the PL model to fit its  SED.     
%If we assume VLT $U$ and $B$ detection to be real, the photometric data can be described by power  PL spectral model. 
Following the approach suggested by   \cite{Sawicki2012} and 
%later 
developed by  \cite{Drouart2018},

framework implementing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. 
To do that, we included FWHM of the {\sl HST} and VLT filters into the {\tt filters} directory of the {\tt Mr-Moose} distributive. 
For the MCMC convergence, we 
%typically 
utilized 
%about 
1000 walkers and 1000 steps.  
The fitting parameters were the spectral index $\alpha$ and the PL normalization $f_{0}$, which were

of 2009, which  are consistent with the detections in these bands of 2000 (see Sec.\ 1).   This led  to a marginal flattening of the best-fit PL. For instance, we obtained $\alpha \approx -0.57$ instead of $-0.63$ without these upper bounds, for $E(B-V)=0.02$. Such a small difference is insignificant accounting for the large error budget (see Table~\ref{tab:extinction}).


 The obtained constraints on the spectral index of the pulsar's nonthermal emission  are compatible with (broader than) 
 a typical range

  On the other hand, the pulsar is also a highly efficient nonthermal emitter in X-rays with

  Figure \ref{fig:8}  
  shows the fit, for the absorbed and unabsorbed spectra, together with the PL fit to the optical-UV spectrum shown in Figure \ref{fig:7}.

  %the optical-UV PL spectrum. 
  If we associate the optical-UV and X-ray PL components with the pulsar's magnetosphere emission, we can conclude that its spectrum steepens with increasing photon energy towards X-rays and  
  has a spectral break somewhere between the UV and soft X-rays,
  %optical through X-ray SED cannot  be described by a single PL model. Instead, the nonthermal spectral component %the nearly flat optical-UV spectrum 
  %steepens with increasing photon energy towards X-rays, 
  similar to other (younger) pulsars that were detected in both X-rays and the optical \citep[e.g.,][]{Kargaltsev2007}. 
  %Since the pulsar is rather faint in X-rays, the spectral parameters are very uncertain. 
 % According to Figure \ref{fig:8}, the spectral break for J0108--1431 
  %is expected near a photon energy $E_{\rm br}\approx 0.2$~keV ($4.5\times 10^{16}$~Hz). 
  %Using the XSPEC, we 
  %fit the optical-UV and X-ray data  simultaneously  with an absorbed  broken PL model with tied $E(B-V)$ and $N_H$ parameters and got $E_{\rm br}=(0.53 \pm 0.06)$~keV, with %$\Gamma$ 
  %spectral indices below and above  the break consistent with those obtained from the separate optical-UV and X-ray fits.
  %spectral fits of the optical-UV and X-ray data. 
  However,  better quality data in both ranges are needed to make a convincing multi-wavelength spectral analysis.  
  
  %Also, we estimated the multi-wavelength 
  %optical through X-ray  
  %efficiency of the pulsar in the 1 eV -- 10 keV range,  $\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2}$, i.e., about twice higher than 
  %in X-rays only. Such high efficiencies are observed  for pulsars only in $\gamma$-rays \citep{2013Abdo}. 
  %However, the spin-down luminosity of PSR J0108--1431, $\dot{E} = 5.1\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 
  %is well below an empirical detection threshold of $\sim  10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$  for pulsars so far detected with {\textit Fermi}. 
  Based on the high optical through X-ray efficiency of J0108--1431, one can speculate 
  that for old pulsars the highest efficiency range 
  migrates from $\gamma$-rays towards lower photon energies.

  \subsubsection{Possibility of thermal emission in FUV and limits on surface temperature}
  
  %Although the possibly detected optical-UV emission of the pulsar is well described by the PL model, the flux uncertainties are so large that other models that include a thermal component can also fit the observed points.
  %Including thermal emission in the fits allows one to constrain the NS surface temperature, which was the main goal of these observations.
  The main goal of these observations was to constrain the NS surface temperature.
  First of all, we note that if the optical emission allegedly detected with the VLT  were thermal, then
  the FUV flux should 
  be much higher than either its presumably measured value or the upper bound, at any reasonable temperature and size of the emitting NS surface. 
 Therefore, we can rule out the temperature estimate by \citet{Mignani2008} derived from the assumption that the optical spectrum is a Rayleigh-Jeans part of thermal emission from the entire NS surface.

%\citet{Mignani2008} suggested that the VLT $UBV$ photometry of the possible pulsar counterpart can be interpreted as the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the thermal emission from the entire surface of the neutron star with the temperature of $(7-10)\times 10^4(D_{130}/R_{13})$ K, where $D_{130}$ and $R_{13}$ are the distance and NS radius in 130~pc and 13~km units, respectively. This interpretation is obviously ruled out now, if the $UB$ and F140LP photometric data points all represent the pulsar counterpart \gp{and the FUV detection is real}. The F140LP data point strongly declines from the suggested Rayleigh-Jeans law. This is true even if we consider this point as an upper limit, but not as the real detection.   

On the other hand, it is possible that the FUV emission is due, at least partly, to a thermal component. If the $U$ and $B$ detections 
are associated with the pulsar, 
%were real, 
then the relatively low upper limit on the $V$ flux does not allow a steep negative slope of the PL component, which leaves little room for the thermal component in F140LP.
If, however, the $U$ and $B$ detections are not associated with the pulsar
%were not real 
while the F140LP detection is,
%real while the $U$ and $B$ detections were not, 
then the F140LP flux  could be entirely thermal. 
As seen from Figure~\ref{fig:8}, it cannot come from  hot polar caps of the pulsar seen in X-rays, but can only come from a cooler bulk surface of the NS.
Assuming that the
spectrum of the NS surface emission 
%of the NS  
is described by the Planck function,
$B_\nu(T) = (2h\nu^3/c^2)[\exp(h\nu/kT)-1]^{-1}$, 
its brightness temperature can be estimated 
from the observed flux density, %equation

f_\nu = (R_\infty/d)^2 \pi B_\nu(T_\infty) 10^{-0.4 A_\nu}\,,

If we assume that the F140LP detection was not real, then
the $3\sigma$ upper bound on the FUV flux density, $f_{\rm F140LP} < 14$ nJy, gives us an upper limit on the
temperature -- e.g., $T_\infty < 5.9\times 10^4$ K ($T<7.7\times 10^4$ K) at $d=300$ pc, $R_\infty = 13.1$ km, $E(B-V)=0.03$ (the corresponding thermal spectrum is shown by the red line in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:9}). 


It is interesting to compare the obtained constraints on the surface temperature of the 
 196
%166 \gp{196 or 200 - corrected for Shklovskii effect} 
Myr old PSR J0108--1431 with those for other old pulsars. Based on the upper limit, $T_\infty \lesssim 6\times 10^4$ K, we can conclude that PSR J0108--1431 is colder than the 17 
%\gp{18 -- 3 digits too much}
Myr old PSR B0950+08, the only old ordinary pulsar whose thermal emission has been detected, with $T_\infty$ in the range of
%$T_\infty \approx
(1--$3)\times 10^5$ K \citep{Pavlov2017}. 

If the F140LP detection of thermal emission from PSR J0108--1431 was real, then 
%the estimated surface temperature of the 200 Myr old PSR J0108--1431, 
the plausible temperature range, 
$T_\infty \approx (2.7$--$5.5)\times 10^4$ K, is just slightly above the conservative 
upper limit, $T_\infty \lesssim 3.2\times 10^4$ K, for the 330 Myr old PSR J2144--3933 \citep{Guillot2019}\footnote{\citet{Guillot2019} present the upper limit $T\approx 4.2\times 10^4$ K %\gp{I would round some temperatures, both here and in the text} 
for 
unredshifted temperature assuming an NS with $R=10$~km and $M=1.4 M_\odot$.}. 
The highest temperature of this range is lower than the surface temperature, 
$T_\infty \approx (1.2-3.5)\times 10^5$~K,  
of the 7 Gyr old  nearest millisecond (recycled) pulsar 
(MSP) J0437--4715 \citep{2004karg,2012durant,2019gonzales}.
It means that either thermal evolution of NSs is not monotonous or it proceeded differently for J0108--1431 and J0437--4715, 
e.g., because  old ordinary and recycled pulsars 
have some different properties, including periods and their derivatives, magnetic field strengths and masses \citep{2015gonz}. 

Confirmation of the possible detection of thermal emission from J0108--1431 would mean that it is the coldest NS whose thermal emission has been detected, but 
%\sout{the still high temperature would}
its temperature is still high enough to support the idea that NSs do not just cool passively 
but some heating mechanisms strongly affect their thermal evolution. 
According to passive cooling scenarios, cooling of isolated NSs %born very hot at supernova explosions,
%begin to cool 
becomes exponentially fast
at ages of  a few  Myr after which  thermal emission from their surfaces %should soon become   invisible at any electromagnetic range
becomes undetectable \citep[e.g.,][]{2004yp}. 
However, this rapid cooling can be partly  compensated by a number of heating mechanisms.
One of them is the so-called rotochemical heating due to composition changes (such as the neutron beta decay) forced by density increase as the centrifugal force decreases in the course of NS spindown 
%deviations from beta equilibrium inside the star due to its contraction with the rotational energy loss  inducing 
%reactions that release heat \citep[so called rotochemical heating,]
%\citep[e.g.,][]{2010GR}. 
\citep{

This heating mechanism has a minor effect on surface temperatures of young NSs but its contribution can  dominate at ages $\gtrsim 10$ Myr. 
%Additional friction heating can also be provide by superfluid vortex creep in the matter inside the NS.
Another important mechanism is ``frictional heating'' caused by interaction of vortex lines of the faster rotating neutron superfluid with the slower rotating normal matter in the inner NS crust \citep{1984Alpar,1999ll}.

\section{Conclusions}

We observed the field of the nearby  
%166 
196 Myr 
old PSR J0108$-$1431 with the {\sl HST} in four optical-UV bands. 
We detected a point-like FUV source in the 
F140LP band at about 3$\sigma$ significance
level with coordinates coinciding with 
the position of the pulsar within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty
of 0\farcs2. 
%accounting for its the known p.m.  
We consider this source as a possible FUV counterpart of 
PSR J0108$-$1431. Also, we placed upper limits on 
the flux densities of the pulsar in the F225W, 
F336W and F438W bands. 
Using more accurate astrometry, we confirmed the 
%likely 
$3\sigma$ detection of the optical source at the pulsar position in year 2000 in the VLT {\bf $U+B$} filters, 
%at the same significance level 
 and its upper limit in the $V$ filter,
 %flux
%density upper limit in the VLT $V$ band 
reported 
earlier by \citet{Mignani2008}.    

Assuming that the possibly detected F140LP, $U$ and $B$ emission comes from the pulsar counterpart,
%possible counterpart is real, 
we analyzed its 
multi-wavelength 
%time-integrated 
spectral energy distribution,
 including the 
archival X-ray data obtained with 
\textit{XMM-Newton}. We found that
the spectral flux density distribution can be described by a %nearly flat 
%spectral 
power-law model in the optical-UV part, suggesting its magnetospheric origin.
%emission of the pulsar has almost a flat 
%nonthermal spectrum of the pulsar magnetosphere 
%origin which 
The spectrum becomes steeper in X-rays, implying %suggesting  
a spectral break between the UV and X-ray ranges. 
%near a photon energy of 
%near 0.2--0.5 keV. 
Such 
%breaks are 
behavior is typical for pulsars observed in both ranges. 
The pulsar has a record high efficiency, $\eta\sim 10^{-2}$, of 
transformation of the 
%rotation 
%energy loss to the nonthermal 
spindown power to nonthermal (magnetosperic) radiation 
in the optical-UV through X-rays.
%$\sim 10^{2}$. 
%Such high efficiencies have been observed

%\begin{equation}

%where $d=210 d_{210}$ pc, $B_\nu(T_\infty) = (2h\nu^3/c^2)[\exp(h\nu/kT_\infty)-1]^{-1}$ is the Planck function, the temperature $T_\infty = 10^5 T_5$ K and the radius $R_\infty = 15 R_{13}$ are as measured by a distant observer. ...

%we can consider a  possibility that the VLT detected an unrelated object and 
%consider the thermal hypothesis based only on the F140LP data point.  (VLT upper limits can be deeper at this position? Did this make sense ? ...)
