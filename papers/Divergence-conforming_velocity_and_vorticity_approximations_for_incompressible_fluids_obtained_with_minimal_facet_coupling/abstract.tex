We introduce two new lowest order methods, a mixed method, and a
hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, for the approximation of
incompressible flows. Both methods use divergence-conforming linear
Brezzi-Douglas-Marini space for approximating the  velocity and the
lowest order Raviart-Thomas space for approximating  
the vorticity. Our methods are based on the physically correct viscous
stress tensor of the fluid, involving the symmetric gradient of
velocity (rather than the gradient),  provide exactly divergence-free
discrete velocity solutions, and optimal error estimates that are also
pressure robust. We explain how the methods are constructed using the
minimal number of coupling degrees of freedom per facet. The stability
analysis of both methods are based on a Korn-like inequality for
vector finite elements with continuous normal component. Numerical
examples illustrate  the theoretical findings and offer comparisons of
condition numbers between the two new methods.
