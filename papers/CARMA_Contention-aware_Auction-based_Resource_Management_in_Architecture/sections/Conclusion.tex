\section{Conclusion} \label{Conclusion}
The paper proposes a distributed resource allocation mechanism for large scale servers. The traditional resource management system are not scalable, especially when tracking the application's dynamic behavior. The main cause of this complexity is the centralized decision making which leads to higher time and space complexity. With increasing number of cores per chip, the scalability of assigning different resources to different applications becomes more challenging in future generation CMP systems. In addition, diversity in application's need make a single objective function inefficient to get an optimal and fair performance metric.    \\
\indent We introduce a framework to map the allocation problem to the known auction economy model where the application get virtual money and based on the utility metric they compete for the shared resource.
