\begin{abstract}
A first principle micromagnetic and statistical
calculation of
viscous remanent magnetization (VRM)  in an ensemble of cubic magnetite
pseudo single-domain particles
is presented.
This is achieved by developing
a fast relaxation algorithm for finding optimal
transition paths between micromagnetic local energy minima.
It combines a nudged elastic band technique with action minimization.
Initial paths are obtained by repetitive minimizations of
modified energy functions.
For a cubic pseudo-single domain particle, 60 different local energy minima are
identified and all optimal energy barriers between them
are numerically calculated for zero external field.
The results allow to  estimate also the energy barriers in
in weak external fields which are necessary to
construct the  time dependent  transition  matrices which describe  the continuous
homogeneous Markov processes of VRM acquisition and decay.
By   spherical averaging the
remanence acquisition in an isotropic PSD ensemble was calculated
over all time scales.
The modelled particle ensemble shows a physically meaningful overshooting
during VRM  acquisition.
The results also explain why
VRM acquisition  in PSD particles can occur much faster than
VRM decay and therefore can explain  for findings of extremely
stable VRM in some paleomagnetic studies.
