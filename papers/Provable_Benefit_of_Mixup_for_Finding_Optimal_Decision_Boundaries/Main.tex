\begin{abstract}
We investigate how pair-wise data augmentation techniques like Mixup affect the sample complexity of finding optimal decision boundaries in a binary linear classification problem. For a family of data distributions with a separability constant~$\kappa$, we analyze how well the optimal classifier in terms of training loss aligns with the optimal one in test accuracy (i.e., Bayes optimal classifier). For vanilla training without augmentation, we uncover an interesting phenomenon named the \emph{curse of separability}. As we increase $\kappa$ to make the data distribution more separable, the sample complexity of vanilla training \emph{increases exponentially} in $\kappa$; perhaps surprisingly, the task of finding optimal decision boundaries becomes harder for more separable distributions. For Mixup training, we show that Mixup mitigates this problem by \emph{significantly reducing} the sample complexity. To this end, we develop new concentration results applicable to $n^2$ pair-wise augmented data points constructed from $n$ independent data, by carefully dealing with dependencies between overlapping pairs. Lastly, we study other masking-based Mixup-style techniques and show that they can \emph{distort} the training loss and make its minimizer converge to a suboptimal classifier in terms of test accuracy.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
