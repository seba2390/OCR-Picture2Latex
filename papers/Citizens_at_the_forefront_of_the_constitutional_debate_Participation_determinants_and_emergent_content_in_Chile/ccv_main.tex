\begin{abstract}
In the past few decades, constitution-making processes have shifted from closed elite writing to incorporating democratic mechanisms. Yet, little is known about democratic participation in deliberative constitution-making processes. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process held by the Chilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest level of citizen participation in the world ($204,402$ people, i.e., $1.3\%$ of the population) for such a process and covered $98\%$ of the national territory. In its participatory phase, people gathered in self-convoked groups of 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote down an argument on why the new constitution should include those social rights. To understand the citizen participation drivers in this volunteer process, we first identify the determinants at the municipality level. We find the educational level, engagement in politics, support for the (left-wing) government, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast, population density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased participation. Moreover, we do not find evidence of political manipulation on citizen participation. In light of those determinants, we analyze the collective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the deliberative phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities, proxied using education levels and main economic activity, facilitates deliberation about themes, concepts, and ideas. These results can inform the organization of new deliberative processes that involve voluntary citizen participation, from citizen consultations to constitution-making processes.

% We find that people in more developed municipalities, in terms of education and economy, use more concepts than actions at deliberating about constitutional rights, 

% no-manipulation

%For instance, related to "Equality" rights, cities with the highest presidential votes share for the left-wing are associated with concepts such as women, men, and social class. In contrast, cities that most voted for the right-wing are associated with concepts such as law, access, and privilege.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

"The punishment which the wise suffer who refuse to take part in the government is to live under the government of worse men," Plato wrote in The Republic\footnote{Variation of the original phrase "But the chief penalty is to be governed by someone worse if a man will not himself hold office and rule." Book 1, 346–347, made by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Society and Solitude (1870)}. This sentence wisely illustrates the relevance of political participation in all its extent. From Plato's epoch, democracy has evolved at incorporating new ways of citizen participation. From Solon asking people to swear for respecting his rules to recent deliberative processes, where people debate about relevant topics, and the conclusions are used as inputs in executive decision-making or even to write a new Carta Magna. 

In the last decades, political participation studies have been mainly focused on voter turnout, engagement in political parties, and civil disobedience in the light of participation determinants such as gender \cite{pachon2012, schlozman1999, pnud}, age \cite{wolfinger1980, highton2001, contreras}, education and income\cite{pnud,verba, corvalan}, and social capital \cite{coleman1988, ladua, klesner, bargsted, mccull, campbell, muller1970, hofferth}. Yet, we still lack a full understanding of democratic and deliberative constitutional-making processes. Recently, the long tradition of elite-class-produced constitutions shifted to a democratic constitution-making process because of it lacked legitimacy \cite{usip}. This new paradigm incorporates citizen participation ex-ante, ex-dure, and ex-post the constitutional text finalization \cite{banks2007, ginsburg2009, usip}, which represents an epitome for political participation. Thus, Plato's quote captures an emergent political trend, citizens at the forefront of the constitutional debate. 

In October 2015 the government of Chile proposed a new constitution-making process, whose final aim is to generate a new social contract. In this process, citizens are at the forefront of the constitutional debate as active participants, generating input for the proposed new constitution. According to an OECD report,\cite{ocde} the case of Chile is unprecedented because of its high rate of participation ($1.13\%$), compared to other experiences, and coverage of $98\%$ of the territory (Fig. \ref{fig:edad}B). Moreover, in terms of gender and age, the participation distribution in the Chilean deliberative process does not differ significantly from the population distribution, suggesting that it represents citizens at the country-level for these two dimensions (Fig. \ref{fig:edad}A). 

The constitutional process started with sessions of civic education for citizens, provided by the government. Then, the participatory phase took place, divided into four stages: i) online individual questionnaire;  ii) local deliberative self-convoked encounters (in Spanish \textit{Encuentros Locales Autoconvocados}, henceforward ``ELAs''); iii) dialogues at the province level; and iv) dialogues at the regional level. At each stage, citizens were asked to debate four constitutional dimensions: i) constitutional principles and values; ii) rights, iii) duties, and iv) institutions. 

Given the increasing demands on social rights in Chile, we specifically focus on the local self-convoked encounters in the dimension of \textit{rights}. $8,113$ ELAs were held during the participatory phase, with a total of $106,412$ participants \cite{memoria}, and each ELA consisted of between 10 to 30 people, all over 14 years old \cite{guiacabildo}. For each of the four constitutional dimensions, participants collectively had to select seven constitutional concepts from a list provided by the government or provide new constitutional concepts after group deliberation (Fig. \ref{fig:edad}C). For each chosen or provided concept, they had to write down a short argument explaining why this concept should be included in the new constitution. The result of this consultation would serve as an input to the elaboration of a new Constitution proposal written by the executive power \cite{ocde}. The proposal was submitted to Congress in March 2018. 
%As the OECD report pointed out,\cite{ocde} including this input in the draft proposal for a new constitution is a challenge, one that the government should not ignore.

Unlike voting, this form of participation is intrinsically social and requires higher commitment, since the ELA required a quorum of 10 people to be valid. Participation in Chilean's constituent process also represents a different type of democratic exercise, a deliberative democracy. Here, we study the determining factors of citizen participation in ELAs by setting up various regression models at the municipality-level. We included socio-demographic and political variables, as well as social capital indicators from different data sources, such as census, the Electoral Service, and the national municipal information system, among others. Regarding the influence of socio-demographic variables, one important finding is that engagement in politics and support for the government increases participation, which suggests that citizen involvement in the constitutional process may have been ideologically driven. Then, we analyze the effects of the citizen participation determinants and other relevant variables on the selection of constitutional rights. Finally, using structural topic modeling, we identify the latent topics in the argument texts. Then, we explore the changes of content for each topic for cities with different characteristics, showing that the emergent content can be ideologically differentiated. 

%our results are consistent with the literature on voting turnout. However,

\subsection*{Participation in constitution-making processes}

In 1787, the United States of America originated a tradition of elite group constitution-making. However, it is now believed that democratic constitutions should be created and adopted through democratic processes because elite-made constitutions suffer from a lack of legitimacy,  i.e., the sense that the constitution represents the people it governs \cite{elster1993,ginsburg2009,usip}. This idea relies on the belief that the sense of ``ownership'' that comes from sharing authorship, enhances the understanding, respect, and support of the constraints that the constitution imposes. Yet, these assumptions have been subject to only limited study, and the precise relationship between participation and its desirable outcomes remains insufficiently studied \cite{ginsburg2009}.

Recent works on evaluation of constitution-making have investigated its effects on democratic governance. A 12-country study, commissioned by the Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), found that ``more representative and inclusive constitution building processes resulted in constitutions favoring free and fair elections, greater political equality, more social justice provisions, human right protections, and stronger accountability mechanisms''\cite{samuels2006}. Later, it was found that public referenda make constitutions more likely to include every category of right, and to provide for universal suffrage, a secret ballot, a referendum process in ordinary government, and a public role in approving constitutional amendments \cite{ginsburg2009}.


Recent constitutions have redefined the long tradition of elite constitution-making, incorporating citizen participation before, during, and after the text is finalized.  This new form of constitution making is supported by numerous international organizations and entities, such as the European Union, the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, the United States Institute of Peace, and the Centre for Democracy and Development \cite{banks2007}. Models of participation differ considerably, not only among countries, but within a country. The modal form of participation in constitutional design is the approval by referendum of the final document as a whole \cite{ginsburg2009}. Other forms of participation include (i) elections for constitutions-making assemblies, (ii) civic education and media campaigns using newspapers, radio, television, web sites, or public meetings; (iii) prior agreement on broad principles as a first phase of constitution making, and (iv) an interim constitution to create space for longer term democratic deliberation \cite{ginsburg2009,usip}.



\subsection*{Political participation}

Most research on political participation has been focused on voting turnout,  engagement in political parties and public debates, and civil disobedience, and in recent decades, voter turnout has led research in the field of political science. While participation is, in general, facilitated by socioeconomic resources and the institutional context, voting is particularly influenced by the competitive context in which elections take place, and by institutional factors, such as registration rules, electoral system, and linkage between parties and social groups \cite{powell}. Here, we introduce some of the main findings on political participation, but, while this form of participation will be similar to constituent processes in some aspects, it likely differs in others. Examining features of the citizens helps us understand differences in political participation.

\textit{Gender}: Latin American women are less likely to be involved in political activities, especially in  protest demonstrations and party affiliation. \cite{pachon2012, schlozman1999}, however, this gender gap in political participation decreases as female participation in labor market increases \cite{schlozman1999}. Moreover, a recent study on electoral turnout in Chile shows that for almost all age groups voter turnout rates for women exceeds voter turnout rates for men \cite{pnud} (See Supplementary note \ref{SN1}).



\textit{Age}: The level of participation is relatively low during early adult life, then gradually increases among middle-aged voters, and softly declines with old age \cite{wolfinger1980}. Particularly in Chile, people who reached the voting age after the end of the military dictatorship of general Pinochet, in 1988, show lower enrollment and participation rates \cite{contreras} (See Supplementary note \ref{SN1}).  


\textit{Education and income}: Income and education level have a positive and significant effect on political participation \cite{verba, pnud}. In Chile, the young electorate is strongly income-biased, which causes voter registration rates in the upper class to double those of lower class \cite{corvalan} (See Supplementary note \ref{SN1}).


\textit{Social capital}: Social capital refers to the social relationships that facilitate action. The production of social capital encourages citizens to become more engaged in a broader range of traditional political activities \cite{ladua, klesner}. Social capital has been proxied using population density and rural population. Population density has shown a negative impact on social capital and social organization for men \cite{mccull}, which would negatively affect voter turnout. The urban and rural residency has mixed conclusions \cite{campbell,muller1970, hofferth}. Particularly for Chile, population density has shown a negative effect, and the rural population has a non-significant impact on electoral participation \cite{bargsted}.
The use of the Internet has been associated with an increase in social capital \cite{horrigan2001,v2001internet}, leading to a positive effect in political participation. Mainly, the more people are involved in online organizational and political activities, the more they are involved in such activities offline \cite{wellman2001}. Moreover, use of the Internet for information exchange (i.e., searching for information and sending email) has a positive impact on civic engagement\cite{v2001internet} for Generation X (See Supplementary note \ref{SN4}).


\section*{Methods}
\label{sec:data}

The new constitution-making process held in Chile in 2016 is particularly important worldwide because of its high levels and geographic coverage of participation. In the entire participatory process participated more than $200,000$ citizens. Here, we focus on the local encounters (ELAs).


\subsection*{Participants}
We use data on all the self-convoked encounters (ELAs), involving $106,412$ participants. For each ELA, the data includes the name of the municipality in which the encounter took place, the age and gender of participants, the collectively agreed upon constitutional rights, and the argument texts. We run several statistical models to explain the number of held ELAs in each municipality, between April and August 2016. The data on ELAs, used in this study, is publicly available and was previously systematized, and all the argument texts were normalized \cite{fierro2017} (See Supplementary Methods \ref{SMet1}). Finally, we used complementary data on 345 out of the 346 Chilean municipalities, after excluding the Chilean Antarctic territory. 

\subsection*{Demographic cohorts}
\subsubsection*{Generations}

According to Strauss and Howe \cite{StraussHowe}, historical events are associated with recurring generational archetypes. Given that the constitutional process is a political event, we define age cohorts based on the Chilean political background. In 1973 the Chilean military, led by general Augusto Pinochet, staged a \textit{coup d'état} against the socialist government of Salvador Allende. An authoritarian military regime ruled the country until the transition to democracy in 1989. It has been found that younger cohorts are likely less politicized, since they did not experience the military dictatorship nor the political climax that prevailed during the transition to democracy \cite{carlin}. Here we use the three age cohorts proposed by Lindh \textit{et al} :\cite{lindh}


\begin{itemize}
\item  Born in 1955 or before: were adults (over 18 years old) when the breakdown of democracy occurred in 1973. 
\item  Born between 1956 and 1980: became adults during the dictatorship, and experienced the following democratic period in which Pinochet was Commander in Chief of the Army (until 1998);
\item  Born in 1981 and after: became adults after the return to democracy.
\end{itemize}




Figure~\ref{fig:edad}A shows the composition of national population and citizen participation in ELAs, by gender and generational cohorts. A chi-squared test was performed to test whether the distributions of age and gender are statistically equivalents between the national population and citizen participation in ELAs. In either case we can reject the null hypothesis of the test, i.e.,  the number of people by age and gender is independent of the instance (national population or citizen participation) at the $1\%$ significance level. Therefore, the participation distribution does not differ significantly from the population distribution. The contingency tables and chi-squared tests results can be found in the Supplemental Material (Tables~\ref{tab:age_chi} and \ref{tab:sex_chi}). 


\subsubsection*{Geography}

On the other hand, the share of population participating in ELAs was substantively different across the country. 
Figure~\ref{fig:edad}B shows citizen participation at the regional level, and the same variability is observed at the municipality level (see Figures~\ref{fig:norte},\ref{fig:centro} and \ref{fig:sur} of the Supplemental Material). %This variability supports the research question of the present work.

\vspace{2mm}

\subsection*{Constitutional dimensions}

During the ELA meetings, the participants were asked to identify the most important constitutional concepts in four dimensions: Values and Principles, Rights, Duties, and Institutions. Given the recent social movement in Chile and the increasing demand on social rights, we focused our analysis on the constitutional concepts within the ``Rights'' dimension. The original list of Rights provided by the government included 45 items, and ELAs participants added 14 new ``rights'' in the process, resulting in 59 rights in total. Among the new concepts,``Social rights'', ``Standard of living'' and ``Right to quality public health care'' reaffirm the increasing demands on social rights in Chile, while ``Respect life from conception'' and  ``Right to make one's own decisions about one's life'' arise as specifications of the original ``Right to Life''.  Figure~\ref{fig:edad}C shows the most voted rights at the national level. The full list of rights available to ELAs participants, along with the new concepts that emerged in the deliberation process, can be found in Section~\ref{sec:elasqq} of the Supplemental Material. 




% \section*{Methodology}
% \label{sec:met}

\subsection*{Citizen participation}

\subsubsection*{Statistical model}

Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models, we study the effects of socio-demographic and political variables on citizen participation. Given that each ELA represents a collective deliberation instance, we measured citizen participation as the total number of ELAs held in each municipality, instead of the total number of participants. Nevertheless, the main findings of this work do not significantly change when using the number of participants as a dependent variable (see Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:ols_pob}). A histogram of the ELAs number of participants at the national level is also provided in Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:size_elas}. The regression model specification is the following:

\begin{equation}
    \log (1 + ELA_i) =  \beta  X_i + e_i,\label{eq:ols}
\end{equation}
where $ELA_i$ is the total number of ELAs held in the municipality $i$, $X_i$ is a vector of covariates, and $e_i$ is a random error term. The coefficients of interest are the $\beta$s, which measure the effect of the covariates on citizen participation. Note that we add $1$ unit to the dependent variable. This correction serves to account for zeroes at the logarithmic transformation \cite{McCune2002Analysis}.

\subsubsection*{Independent variables}
Participants did not provide any personal information about income, education, or political inclination. Therefore, the model is estimated at the municipality-level, using aggregated data on socioeconomic and demographic indicators.


We also included political variables to assess the impact of political engagement, such as voter turnout, party affiliation, and political orientation. We further included variables relative to the municipality in order to test whether people were mobilized to participate. We collect all the independent variables from official national sources, such as the population and housing census (CENSO), the Electoral Service (SERVEL), the national municipal information system (SINIM), the national office for regional development (SUBDERE), and the National Socio-Economic Characterization Survey (CASEN). Table~\ref{tab:var_desc} presents a detailed description of the independent variables (see also Supplementary Methods \ref{SMet2}). The descriptive statistics and the correlation for the most relevant variables can be found in the Supplemental Material (Tables~\ref{tab:stats} and Figure~\ref{fig:correlations}, respectively). 


\include{Tables/indep_variables}


\subsection*{Text analysis}

To analyze all the argument texts of each self-convoked encounter, we use Structural Topic Modeling (STM) \cite{roberts2014stm}, which is a widely-used method for text analyzing \cite{roberts2014, bohr2018, lindstedt2019, almquist2019, herrera2019understanding}. As every topic modeling algorithm, STM assumes that each document in a text corpus is produced from a mixture of latent topics, estimated from the text data, which in turn consists of a collection of words \cite{Blei2012}. Besides, STM enables the use of document-level metadata information, whose goal is to discover latent topics and estimate their relationship to the document metadata. Thus, this method serves as the bridge between statistical techniques and research goals. (See Supplementary Methods \ref{SMet3} for a detailed explanation of Structural Topic Modeling).

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection*{Citizen participation in ELAs}

Table~\ref{tab:all} reports standardized ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions of the number of ELAs on several socio-demographic and political variables. The number of ELAs, population, and the number of organizations are count variables, and Mayor, Incumbent Mayor, and SUBDERE groups are categorical. The remaining variables are expressed as the share of the population. For instance, Rurality represents the share of the municipality-level population living in rural areas. Variables with high skewness were transformed with a base 10 log function. The transformed variables are the number of ELAs, population, population density, and the number of community organizations. The p-value of the Ramsey Regression Equation Specification Error Test (RESET) is provided in the caption of each table throughout this work. Only significant interactions are shown in Table~\ref{tab:all}, but the full list of interactions can be found in the Supplemental Material (Table~\ref{tab:SM_full}). 


The number of ELAs strongly depends on the population. As expected, this variable is the most variance-explicative predictor of citizen participation. Model 1 Table~\ref{tab:all} includes variables for socio-economic and social capital. This model shows significant and positive effects for higher education, internet penetration rate, and the number of community organizations. Model 2 includes demographic variables, where population density and two-parent family (with children) show significant and negative effects. Finally, Model 3 (for a performance plot see Supplementary Figure \ref{fig_sim}) incorporates political variables. 


The share of votes for the incumbent president has a significant and positive effect on the number of ELAs, as well as the percentage of people who are affiliated to any political party. The non-significant effects of Mayor and Government influence (see Supplementary Talble \ref{tab:SM_gov}) variables suggest no evidence of political mobilization by mayors or deputies was found. Finally, the share of Evangelical Christians shows a negative effect that, although small in magnitude, is highly significant. The variance inflation factors are all less than 5 except, for education ($5.5$) and population ($10.3$) (Supplementary Table \ref{tab:SM_VIF}). Considering that the dependent variable in equation \ref{eq:ols} is a count variable, we run a negative binomial regression as an additional robustness check, which accounts for over-dispersion (see Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_poisson}). Comparison with Model 3 Table~\ref{tab:all} shows no significant changes for the main results. Therefore, all subsequent models are estimated using OLS.   

\input{Tables/tabla1}


\subsection*{Constitutional rights selection}
\label{sec:ccs}

How do the socio-political determinants of citizen participation impact the selection of constitutional rights? To address this question, we use the most relevant determinants of citizen participation found in the previous section. These are (i) Higher Education; (ii) Population density; and (iii) Votes for current president. We also add other relevant variables, (iv) SEDI (Socio-Economic Development Index); (v) share of municipality population which declare to participate in primary economic activities (CENSO). Finally, given that the Santiago Metropolitan Region exhibits different living dynamics than all other regions of Chile, we included a variable to compare the municipalities belonging to the Santiago Metropolitan Region to all the other municipalities of Chile. We named this last variable as ``Geographic". 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/Fig2.pdf}
\caption{What constitutional rights do people select at the municipality level? Differences are shown in the proportion of selection for the 18 most voted concepts. From left to right, municipalities are grouped by the top and bottom quartiles for higher education, population density, votes for the current president, SEDI (Socio-economic Development Index), primary economic activity, and geographical zone.  For each citizen participation determinant, the bar length is calculated as the difference between the proportion of mentions of a constitutional right in municipalities in the top quartile and its proportion in municipalities in the bottom quartile. For instance, a positive (negative) value means that the more (less) educated municipalities select that concept in a higher proportion than less (more) educated counties. Particularly, the constitutional right to social security is selected significantly more in municipalities whose share of people with higher education is in the top quartile in the country. In simple words, the most educated municipalities select significantly more the right to social security, when compared to the less educated municipalities. Bar color: dark blue when the $\chi ^2$ test is significant at $99\%$, and light blue otherwise.} 
\label{fig:derechos}
\end{figure}



For each variable, except Geographic, we consider the municipalities in the top and bottom quartiles. Then, we compared the number of times each constitutional concept was selected, as a proportion of the total number of constitutional concepts selected in those municipalities. This comparison was performed using a 2-sample test for equality of proportions ($\chi ^2$ test). For example, the first panel of Figure~\ref{fig:derechos} shows the difference in concept selection between the top 25 percent and the bottom 25 percent of municipalities for Higher Education. For each concept, the bar length is calculated as the share of that concept in the top $25\%$ group, minus the share of that concept in the bottom $25\%$ group. Therefore, a positive (negative) value means that the more (less) educated municipalities selected that concept in a higher proportion than less (more) educated counties. For the Geographic variable, the municipality separation was made based on the region to which they belong. A positive value means that the municipalities belong to the Metropolitan Region selected those concepts in higher proportions.


\subsection*{Topic modeling}

The argument texts were analyzed using the Structural Topic Model (STM), a tool that enables estimating topics including document-level metadata. The corpus consisted of all argument texts that were written for constitutional Rights throughout all ELAs. Each text corresponds to a document of the corpus, and the constitutional concept (to which the text refers) was incorporated as prevalence document metadata. 

\input{Tables/coef_STM}

%\input{Tables/words_stm}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/STM_todosD.pdf}
    \caption{A word comparison of the constitutional rights debate, at the municipality level. We show the emergent topics: Education, Equality, Security, and Environment for three different citizen participation determinants, presidential votes, socio-economic development, and economic activity. Words are oriented along the X-axis based on how much they are associated to the inspected determinant. For instance, in the Education topic and Presidential Votes determinant, the word ``universal,'' which is on the left side, is associated with the municipalities where the elected president got the least of the votes. The word ``free,'' which is on the right side, is associated with the municipalities where the elected president got most of the votes. We note that for the topic Equality,  the word ``process'' comes from ``due process'' and ``treatment'' refers to ``behaviour towards''. Likewise, for the topic Security, ``door'' comes from ``revolving door'', which refers to inmate release and recidivism, and  ``can live'' comes from ``can live peacefully in our neighborhood''. }
    \label{fig:fit2}

We estimated an STM with 23 topics in our corpus. We chose the number of topics by performing various model diagnostics such as Held-Out Likelihood and the Semantic Coherence for a different number of topics (See Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:ntopic}). We also included the constitutional ``rights" concepts as prevalence covariates in the model. The authors manually assigned the topic labels by looking at two sets of words for each topic. The first is a set of highest probability words, inferred directly from topic-word distribution. The second is a set of words that are both frequent and exclusive for each topic \cite{bischof2012}. 

Table~\ref{tab:coef_stm3} shows both sets of words, for four different topics (Education, Equality, Security, and Environment). These topics were selected as examples because they cover a broad range of themes and show a considerable difference in content when comparing groups across different determinants. The sets of words for the 23 topics can be found in Figures~\ref{fig:wordcloud1} and \ref{fig:wordcloud055} of Supplemental Material, in the original language (Spanish). 



We asked how each constitutional concept affects the topic proportion? We ran a regression model in which each document is an observation; the outcome variable is the probability that a specific topic generates each document in the STM model (remember that we model each document as a weighted combination of topics). The explanatory variables are all constitutional rights. Therefore, the estimated coefficients represent, for each topic, the effect of the constitutional rights on the topic.  Table~\ref{tab:coef_stm3} shows the regression results for the same four topics. Since each topic has 59 explanation variables (the total number of constitutional rights); we display here only the top three categories, i.e., the constitutional concepts with the highest topic proportion within each topic, for each regression. The results show agreement between the topics emerging from the argument texts and the concepts that originated those texts. The regression results for the remaining topics can be found in Table~\ref{tab:coef_stm}.



We observe that socio-demographic and political variables alter the frequency in which a particular concept is mentioned (Figure~\ref{fig:derechos}), and it is also likely that those variables affect how topics are discussed. Therefore, we estimate a second STM model with prevalence and topic content covariates. Recalling that, while topic prevalence captures how much each topic contributes to a document, topic content variables enable the vocabulary used to discuss a particular topic to vary. Here, we use three different determinants as covariates: presidential votes, socio-economic development, and primary economic activity. Figure~\ref{fig:fit2} shows the differences in vocabulary by association level with the determinants for four topics: Education, Equality, Security, and, Environment. The list of words for each group and topic, along with representative phrases can be found in Tables~\ref{tab:stm_env} to \ref{tab:stm_eq}.

\section*{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

% \subsection*{Demographic factors}

In Table \ref{tab:all} we observe that population density has a negative and significant effect on the number of ELAs that were held in a municipality. This finding is in agreement with previous research reporting that high population density has a negative impact on social capital \cite{mccull}. 


Regression results show a positive effect on the share of women and a negative effect on the youngest age cohort. Even though both effects are non-significant, their signs are in agreement with voting behavior in Chile, where the younger cohorts exhibit the lowest participation rate, and voter turnout rates for women exceed those for men \cite{pnud}. 
Our model also indicates that fewer ELAs were organized in municipalities with a higher proportion of single-parent families and two-parent families with children. An intuitive explanation is that people with children have less time to engage in social activities. However, previous research has reported an indirect effect of having children in political participation, through its consequences for female labor force participation and the consequent impact on social capital \cite{schlozman1999}.


% \subsection*{Socio-economic factors}

According to the literature on political participation and social capital, education has a high impact both on social participation \cite{huang}, and in the understanding of complex political information \cite{verba}. As expected, our results confirm a significant and positive return to education, measured as the share of people with higher education, on the number of ELAs.  Furthermore, from all the significant regressors of the full model, education has the second-highest coefficient, after population (Table \ref{tab:all}). Besides, we include the number of community organizations in our model as a proxy of social capital at the municipality level. The result shows a positive and slightly significant effect after controlling for. However, the coefficient is not robust after controlling for socio-political confounders, suggesting that this variable can be correlated to one of those confounder or that the number of community organizations does not represent actual participation in those organizations.


%%%
The socio-economic factor, represented here by the SUBDERE groups, shows no significant effect in the number of ELAs. SUBDERE classification reflects the municipality dependence on the Municipal Common Fund, and it is used here as a proxy on municipal residents' income.  Since the socio-demographic groups created by SUBDERE incorporates the population in the municipality classification, this variable may be correlated with population density. Therefore, Model 3 in Table~\ref{tab:all} (henceforth called "the full model") was repeated, replacing SUBDERE classification with a poverty measure, which also shows no significant effect (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_pobr}). %Both poverty and socio-demographic groups intend to quantify a municipality's vulnerability, though the latter integrates population so that it may be interfering with other demographic factors.% 
The regression results using poverty are shown in Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_pobr}. Replacing SUBDERE with poverty in the model does not substantially change the effect of the other socio-economic or demographic variables. 


%%%%%

Internet penetration rate shows a consistent, positive, and significant effect on the number of ELAs. This result is consistent with previous research showing a positive impact of the Internet on social relations and civic engagement. The result of this comparison is shown in Table~\ref{tab:SM_casen}.  Given this variable has been derived from CASEN survey, we performed three comparisons (Supplementary Method \ref{SMet2}), we show that at considering only the 139 counties where the CASEN survey is representative, the effect of the Internet penetration rate becomes non-significant. However, in the bootstrapped regression the effect is also non-significant and the error increases, suggesting that the loss of statistical significance may be due to the smaller sample.


% \subsection*{Political factors}

Regarding political variables, the share of votes going to the winning candidate in the first round of the presidential election has a positive and significant effect on participation (Table~\ref{tab:all}). This effect remains when considering the voting of the second ballot (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_votos}). This result suggests that people who supported the winning candidate were more willing to organize and participate in an ELA since the whole idea of the new constitution was devised and started by the government they chose. 

On the other hand, voter turnout for the first round of the 2013 presidential election has a positive but non-significant effect in the number of ELAs (Table~\ref{tab:all}). For the runoff election, however, the effect becomes positive and significant (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_votos}). Note that voter turnout for the second round was about seven percentage points lower than for the first round ($50\%$ in the first round, $43\%$ in the runoff ballot), which is not unusual. The phenomenon of turnout decline in runoff elections has been studied for the past 40 years. In particular, the decline is higher when the election result seemed predetermined, and when the vote proportion received in the first round by candidates not qualifying for the runoff goes up \cite{pierce1981,wright}. The latter implies that the runoff election does not involve the diversity of ideas that led many voters to turn out at the first ballot. In simple words, many of those who abstain from the second ballot do so because no candidate represents them. Therefore, the positive and significant effect of voter turnout in the runoff election may also reflect citizen support for the winning candidate.

Party affiliation is also a positive and significant variable (Table~\ref{tab:all}), although this variable includes political parties both within the government coalition and within the opposition coalition. When the model incorporates only parties within the government coalition or only parties within the opposition coalition, the effect remains positive and significant. This result suggests that municipalities with people more actively engaged in politics have a better disposition to participate in an ELA, even if they dislike the government proposing the constitution-making idea.

Political mobilization was explored by evaluating the political affiliation of the mayor. No significant effect was found. To test whether mobilization was driven by members of Parliament, a new variable was created, which we called ``Government influence`'' and combines the political affiliation of mayors and deputies. In Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_gov}, the variables Mayor and Incumbent Mayor were replaced with this variable, but this effect was not significant.

Finally, the negative and significant effect of the share of Evangelical Christians on the number of ELAs presents a question on the role of religion in society. It has been argued that Churches --in the USA context-- play an important role in building up the civic skills of those least likely to participate in politics \cite{jones2001}. However, this might not be true for Chilean evangelicals who often perceive themselves as second-class citizens, legally and socially disadvantaged in comparison to the members of the Catholic Church \cite{boas2016} and, therefore, might be inclined to disengage from political activity.




% \subsection*{Concepts selection and topic modeling}

A significant variation on constitutional concept selection (Figure~\ref{fig:derechos}) suggests that the previously found socio-political determinants of citizen participation also impact the selection of constitutional rights. At first, let us note that \textit{Fair Wage}, \textit{Security/Non violence} and \textit{Non-discrimination} show a negative and significant variation for ``Higher education'' and SEDI, and a positive and significant variation for ``Votes for current president'' and ``Primary economic activity''. These effects may reflect the needs of a vulnerable population, subject to precarious working conditions and a violent environment, for better and safer living conditions. Also, the share of votes for the current president serves as a proxy for left-wing political orientation, which is usually characterized by the concern for social welfare and equality. The co-occurrence of significant differences in socioeconomic variables (and their signs) are consistent with the correlation among those variables, i.e., ``Higher education'' correlates positively with SEDI and negatively with ``Votes for current president'' and ``Primary economic activity'' (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:corr_short}). 


Regarding \textit{Education} and \textit{Healthcare}, there is a significant difference between the municipalities within the Metropolitan Region and the municipalities in the rest of Chile (panel ``Geographic'' of Figure~\ref{fig:derechos}). As expected, since Chile is one of Latin America's most highly centralized countries, the latter group selected both constitutional rights more frequently, which points to a lack of access to health and educational centers. This result is particularly crucial for \textit{Healthcare}, which also shows a significant difference for ``Population density'' and ``Primary economic activity''.  Finally, the right to \textit{Security/Non-violence} was highlighted by counties within the metropolitan region, which suggest a particular concern about crime in this zone.


Figure~\ref{fig:fit2} shows how the share of votes for the current president, which reflects support for the government, as well as other socio-demographic variables, changes the way topics are discussed. In the case of the topic ``Environment'', the word ``water'' is strongly associated with the top government supporting municipalities (left-wing), and with municipalities with low population density, and a lower proportion of highly educated people (Supplementary Figure \ref{fig:fit2SM}). This is also related to the concept \textit{Right to water}, that emerged during the ELAs, and claims the nationalization of natural resources. On the other hand, the topic ``Education'' shows a transverse support for free and public education, while words like  ``access'' and ``universal'' predominates in highly educated, more highly socioeconomically developed, and right-wing municipalities. For topic ``Equality,'' highly educated, more socioeconomic developed, and right-wing municipalities discuss ``law'' and ``equality'' more, while their opposite groups are more concerned about gender equality and social classes. 


Topic modeling also enables us to explore the emergent content of the whole corpus. Given that each document is associated with a particular constitutional concept, the STM shows us how different constitutional concepts mix into topics. For instance, the topic ``Equality'' (Table~\ref{tab:coef_stm3}) contains three related concepts of similar proportions (\textit{Equality before the law, Access to justice}, and \textit{Equality}).%, the topic ``Education''  mainly consists of the homonymous concept. 
This mixture of topics is especially relevant in this context, for many of the concepts were added by the participants, although they were variations or combinations of existing concepts.  For example, the topic ``Environment'' comprises the \textit{Right to water}, which was not included in the original list. Figure~\ref{fig:fit2} shows that the word ``water'', probably arising from the  \textit{Right to water},  is strongly associated with a political position. Finally, it is worth noting that the concept \textit{Freedom of movement} is associated to the topic ``Security'', suggesting that this right is interpreted as ``moving safely'' rather than the right of  travel from place to place, or changing the place where one resides or works.

Words have different psychological properties, and tend to be processed in the brain very differently \cite{miller1995, tausczik2010}. Therefore, the terms shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fit2} can also be categorized according to their linguistic usage. Typically, a content/style classification is used to distinguish between \textit{what} people are saying, i.e., the content of a communication, and \textit{how} people are communicating, the style words. Since most of the style words, such as nouns, many adjectives and adverbs, have been removed from the corpus for the purpose of the topic modeling, here we classify between nouns/adjectives and verbs/verbal phrases. 

At first, we classified each term as ``action'' or ``concept''. For example, all terms containing verbs, such as ``must'', ``can live'' or ``(there must) be education'',  are classified as actions, while nouns like ``security'' and ``profit'', and adjectives like ``safe'' and ``familiar'', are classified as concepts. In general, all topics show more concepts than actions. However, by looking at  Figure~\ref{fig:fit2}, and counting actions and concepts across the two levels in all variables, some comparisons can be drawn. For instance, municipalities with a higher socio-economic development index use more concepts than their less developed peers, particularly for topics ``Equality'' and ``Security''. On the other hand, for topic ``Security'', the municipalities with a higher share of people working in primary economic activity use more actions in their arguments, in comparison to the opposite group. It is therefore hypothesized that conceptualization is related to knowledge. Knowledge facilitates proposing themes, concepts and ideas, so that the greater the knowledge, the greater the conceptualization. 

Furthermore, the use of verbal forms such as ``There must be...'', ``must have'', ``can live'' are linked to normative or prescriptive intentions. In many of our cases, the terms classified as ``actions'' are actually this type of verbal form. Let us take a look at the topic ``Security'', for the socio-economic development variable (Figure~\ref{fig:fit2}). The four actions associated with the less developed municipalities are ``can live'' , ``can'', ``must live'', ``must''.  This would indicate a predominantly normative intention from this group.  However,  a sentiment analysis also reveals that the terms used by them score higher (positive) in comparison to the more developed municipalities (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:stm_sent}). This is mainly caused  by the predominant use of verbs by this group. In general, verbs in this corpus have a positive connotation: ``get-better'', ``guarantee'', ``can live''. All this suggests that this normative intention may be driven by the sentiment: If the matter concern you, you probably won't produce conceptually dense arguments; rather, you will express a desire, a proposal for action.

\section*{Conclusions}

The Chilean constitution-making process of 2016 was a unique experiment in terms of the political history of the country, and its unprecedented high level of participation and territory coverage compared to similar processes held in other countries \cite{ocde}. Taken together, our results show that engagement in politics and support for the government increased participation. However, no evidence of political mobilization by mayors or deputies was found, which suggests that citizen involvement in the constitutional process was ideologically, but voluntarily biased. As the OECD report conjectures, ``those citizens who support the acting government may be more likely to participate in the consultation, even when all citizens are given that opportunity''\cite{ocde}. On the other hand, the ranking of constitutional concepts, specifically of constitutional rights, shows different priorities for different groups, which may result from social needs or political beliefs. Finally, using a structural topic modeling approach, we find that the emerging content from ELAs can be mapped ideologically. Moreover, We find that people in more knowledgeable municipalities, i.e., high levels of education,socio-economic development, and complex economic structure, use more themes concepts, and ideas than actions, suggesting that knowledge facilitates proposing themes, concepts, and ideas, so that the greater the knowledge, the greater the conceptualization. These results can inform new deliberative and massive consulting processes, which in the near future may be a common means of political participation. 


%To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a constitutional process of such a magnitude is studied.

% \section{Conclusions}

% The Chilean constitution-making process that started in 2015 was a unique experiment in terms of the country’s political history [REF?]. While overall participation may seem limited, it was actually very significant in comparative terms. Thus, this serves as an interesting case-study on political participation and it provides a new source of data for socio-political analysis. As we study the determinants of participation in this process, measured as the number of ELAs held in each county, our results confirm the main results that appear in the literature regarding the influence of socio-demographic variables. Given that this type of political participation is somewhat different to the typical problem of voter turnout, some political variables are also relevant here. Our results show that engagement in politics and support for the government increased participation, which suggest that citizen involvement in the constitutional process was ideologically biased. On the other hand, the ranking of constitutional concepts - specifically of constitutional rights - shows different priorities for different groups, which may result from social needs or political beliefs. Finally, using a novel methodological approach we find that the content that emerged from these encounters can be mapped ideologically. This is an important application of text analysis methods in Latin American politics ....

\section{Supplementary Notes}

\subsection{Socio-demographic factors and political participation}\label{SN1}

In Latin America, the gender gap index by the World Economic Forum shows a low performance in political empowerment, compared to economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, and health \cite{pachon2012}. Latin American women are less likely to be involved in political activities, especially in  protest demonstration and party affiliation. This phenomenon is closely related to women's occupations; in general, the greater the female labor force participation, the greater their political participation \cite{pachon2012}. A 1999 study on gender, employment, and political participation found a number of factors that are fostered at work and enhance political activity, such as getting requests for activity on the job, supervising others, and exercising civic skills \cite{schlozman1999}. For women, the experience of being discriminated against on the basis of sex would also lead to political activity. Furthermore, being married and having children at home, indirectly depresses political activity through consequences for workforce participation \cite{schlozman1999}. However, a recent study on electoral turnout in Chile shows that for almost all age groups voter turnout rates for women exceeds voter turnout rates for men \cite{pnud}.  


The relationship between voter turnout and age is well-established in the literature. The level of participation is relatively low during early adult life, then gradually increases among middle-aged voters, and softly declines with old age \cite{wolfinger1980}. This behavior has been connected to a variety of adult-roles, such as settling down, marriage, home ownership, getting a job, and leaving school \cite{highton2001}. However, in Chile  there is also a generational effect in voter turnout due to the electoral system. Those who registered to vote in the 1988 plebiscite were enrolled in a system with mandatory voting until 2011, which would explain the increase in electoral participation with age. This behavior is not directly associated with the age of people, but with their registration rate. Those who reached the voting age after the plebiscite show lower enrollment and participation rates \cite{contreras}. 



Regarding the socioeconomic resources, income and education level have a positive and significant effect on political participation. Economic and cultural resources provide the intellectual and cognitive skills that typically reduce the subjective costs of participation \cite{verba}. In Chile, the young electorate is strongly class-biased, particularly by income, which causes voter registration rates in the upper class to double those of lower class citizens \cite{corvalan}. At the municipality level, an analysis of the 2016 municipal election in Chile showed a negative effect of income on voter turnout \cite{pnud}. However, this effect reverses when the observations are contained to Santiago Metropolitan Region. This implies that spacial socioeconomic segregation is stronger in Santiago than in the rest of Chile, where different socioeconomic classes coexist in the same municipality \cite{pnud}. 

%An alternative two age-groups classification was tested, by separating those who were able to vote in the 1988 referendum, from those who were under the voting age at that time. Regression results show no significant differences with the original model (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:SM_edad}). 

\subsection{Social capital in political participation}\label{SN4}

Since ELAs are group activities, social capital emerges as a relevant predictor of citizen participation. The term ``social capital'' was introduced by Coleman (1988) as a conceptual tool to describe how rational or purposive action is shaped by the social context \cite{coleman1988}. Just as physical capital improves tools to facilitates production, and human capital brings people new skills and capabilities, social capital relies on the relations among persons that facilitate action. There is empirical evidence suggesting that the production of social capital encourages citizens to become more engaged in a broader range of traditional political activities \cite{ladua}. In Latin America this relation holds true: a study conducted using data from Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru, shows that greater involvement in non-political organization, as well as higher levels of interpersonal trust, leads to more participation in political activities \cite{klesner}. 

In a municipality-wide study of electoral participation in Chile, Bargsted \textit{et al} \cite{bargsted} use two proxy variables to measure social capital: population density and rural population. High population density would have a negative impact in social capital and social organization for men \cite{mccull}, which would negatively affect voter turnout. On the other hand, studies on the role of urban and rural residency in promoting political activity have reached mixed conclusions. While some studies had found that urbanization would make political participation easier,\cite{campbell,muller1970} others have shown that isolation and the lesser availability of public service in rural areas increase the sense of responsibility to others \cite{hofferth}, promoting social capital and therefore civic engagement. The evidence in Chile shows a significant negative effect of population density on electoral participation, but no significant effect of rural population \cite{bargsted}.

On the other hand, participation in voluntary association is commonly used to measure social capital \cite{putnam1995}.  This idea is based on the assumption that membership in voluntary associations generates trust and facilitates cooperation among members. Also, citizens that join voluntary organizations usually meet more people,  expand their social circle, and hence become more engaged in civic life \cite{verba}.  However, participation in associations represent only a small part of human interaction. Other networks, such as  family, schools, work, media and internet, have a strong impact on norms and values \cite{westlund}. Therefore, the role of associations in social capital generation may be limited. Recent research has addressed the role of media in the production of social capital. The evidence suggests that  use of the Internet supplements network capital by extending existing levels of personal and telephone contact, therefore increasing social contact and civic engagement \cite{horrigan2001,v2001internet}. Thus, the more people are involved in online organizational and political activities, the more they are involved in such activities offline \cite{wellman2001}.  


As well as the electoral participation, social capital is influenced by socio-demographic factors, such as education, age and gender. Education plays an important role in social capital production. Schooling not only spreads knowledge, but also cultivates social norms, which is the core of social capital. In schools, students learn the basic norms and responsibilities in society, and values such as reciprocity, respect and trust. A meta-analysis of the effect of education on social capital shows a significant and positive return to education on individual social capital \cite{huang}.  It has been found that social capital, measured as occupational network resources, also varies across the life course. While daily social interaction decreases with age, social resources from occupational networks and voluntary memberships tend to increase with age, leveling off among older respondents \cite{mcdonald}. Regarding gender, being male as opposed to being female appears to increase the probability of group membership \cite{greek}.  Finally, marital status and the presence of children at home have also been considered as control variables in social capital and electoral participation literature \cite{soroka,greek,carlin}.


 %Rurality, on the other hand, shows no significant effect. Our results on both variables are consistent with the findings on voter turnout in Chile reported by Bargsted $et$ $al$\cite{bargsted}, where these variables are used as proxy for social capital. This may suggest that social capital is playing a similar role in different forms of political participation.

\section{Supplementary methods}

\subsection{Argument texts}\label{SMet1}
Along with the constitutional concept selection, each ELA had to write, for each selected concept, a short argument about why this concept is relevant and should be included in the new constitution. These texts were subsequently processed and classified by Fierro $et$ $al$ (2017) \cite{fierro2017}. At first, they classified all the arguments using three kinds of propositions: facts (what it “is”, “was”, or “will be”), values (propositions representing evaluation statements), and policies (“what should be done?”). Then, each argument was normalized to follow the structural pattern subject – verb – direct object -  complement. In this process, more than 120 annotators participated, selected from local undergrad students and professionals in sociology, psychology, political science, linguistics, etc. The classification process was validated by sampling a random set of annotations, which were corrected again by the team.  The estimated error was less than $15\%$. Afterwards they searched for automatic classification tasks that mimic the human processes, testing standard linear classifiers, and simple neural-network based methods. They found that some of the manual tasks are suitable for automatization, particularly the classification of arguments, for which they achieved a $90\%$ top-5 accuracy in a multi-class classification of arguments \cite{fierro2017}.

\subsection{Independent variables}\label{SMet2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Demographic variables: Population over 14 years old; population density; share of population living in rural areas; cohorts of age and gender; share of single-parent and two-parent families. 
\item Socioeconomic variables: Education, measured as the share of people with higher education; internet penetration rate; socio-demographic classification in 7 groups, where group 1 is the most vulnerable in terms of its dependence on the municipal common fund and the local population. This classification was developed by SUBDERE in 2005, and it is incorporated in the model as a categorical variable. We also use a measure of poverty, obtained with a Small Area Estimation\footnote{Small-area estimation (SAE) refers to methods to address the limitations of survey data to produce reliable estimates of poverty for different geographical locations. The methodology used in Chile combines data from CASEN curvey and Census.} (SAE) methodology, as an alternative for SUBDERE groups. In Section~\ref{sec:ccs} we use a socioeconomic development index (SEDI) proposed by the Public Health Observatory in Chile, which comprises education, income, poverty and housing materiality. 
\item Social capital variables: number of community organizations in the municipality, such as parent centers, cultural centers, sport clubs, among others; share of municipality population that declares to participate in a community organization.
\item Political variables: Party affiliation, measured as the share of population affiliated to a political party; voter turnout in 2013's presidential elections; share of votes received by the winning candidate in 2013's presidential elections, who started the constitutional process in 2015 and was the standing president in 2016; share of population employed by the municipality (municipal officials). Additionally, three dummy variables were include to measure the effect of the  political party which supported the winning candidate for mayor, during the 2012's  municipal elections: the first one is equal to 1 if the party is within the government coalition, and 0 otherwise; the second one is equal to 1 if the party is in the opposition, and 0 otherwise. The third dummy variable is assigned to 1 when the mayor ran for office with no formal party support. Finally, a dummy variable is included for incumbent mayors. 
\item Religion: In Chile, evidence suggest that participation in evangelical Christians religion can provide skills that members can transfer to political activity \cite{patterson2005religious}. Therefore, an additional variable is added to account for the share of evangelical Christians living in the municipality. 

\item Internet penetration rate: This variable has been derived from CASEN survey. To assess the real impact of CASEN's lack of representativeness on the Internet effect, we performed the following comparison: (i) full model with all the 328 counties comprised in CASEN survey; (ii) full model with the 139 counties where the CASEN survey is representative; (iii) bootstrapping of the full model with random samples of 139 counties (the actual number of observations in each case is slightly different due to missing values). The purpose of (iii) is to evaluate whether the changes from (i) to (ii) result from the reduction of the sample size. The result of this comparison is shown in Table~\ref{tab:SM_casen}.

\subsection{Text analyzing}\label{SMet3}

The analysis of large text corpora has proven fruitful in a range of topics in social sciences, including the analysis of discourse surrounding social movements \cite{bail2012}, content analysis for political texts \cite{grimmer2010,grimmer2013}, mapping social conflicts from legal sentences \cite{herrera2019understanding}, research choice and the production of scientific knowledge \cite{foster2015}, and communication and collaboration within organizations\cite{goldberg2016} (for a review of the history of content and text analysis in sociology and the social sciences, see Evans and Aceves (2016) \cite{evans2016}). In particular, Topic Modeling refers to a group of inductive techniques used to discover hidden topics contained in text documents. In general, these models assume that each document in a text corpus is produced from a mixture of latent topics, which in turn consists of a collection of words. Among these models, Structural Topic Modeling (STM) is a promising technique that enables researchers to incorporate document-level metadata information. STM has been used to find latent topics in social scientific research \cite{lindstedt2019, bohr2018}, to analyze open-ended survey responses \cite{roberts2014}, and even to uncover the underlying network structure of the radical activist groups by identifying topics in radical environmentalist publications \cite{almquist2019}. To implement this analysis we use the standard \textit{stm} R package developed by Roberts, Stewart, and Tingley (2018) \cite{stm}.


It is useful to define certain terminology specific to topic modeling \cite{Blei2012}.
      
\begin{itemize}
\item Topics: variables not observed in our data set; latent variables that allow capturing abstract notion; defined as the set of elements that can represent a theme present in a collection of documents without loss of statistical information.
\item Word: is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an element of a vocabulary indexed by $ {1 \dots V} $. Words are represented by unit-based vectors that have a single component equal to 1 and all others equal to zero. By means of supra-indexes the vocabulary components are denoted, for example, the $ v ^{th}$ indexed word is represented by a vector $ w $ long $ V $ such that $ w^v = 1 $ and $ w^u = 0 $ for $ u \neq v $.
\item Document: is a sequence of $ N $ words denoted by $ w = (w_1, w_2 \dots w_n) $, where $ w_n $ is the $ n-th $ word in the sequence. In our particular context, a document corresponds to a online post.

\item Corpus: is a collection of $ M $ documents denoted by $ D = {w_1, w_2, \dots w_M} $.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{CTM}  

Correlation Topic Model (CTM) is generative probabilistic model of a corpus. The basic idea is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, whereby each topic is characterized by a distribution over words \cite{blei2003}. CTM uses a logistic normal distribution for the topic proportions, which allows for covariance structure among the components. This distribution models correlation between components of the simplicial random variable through the covariance matrix of the normal distribution. 

\vspace{2mm}

Let $\{ \mu, \Sigma \}$ be a $K$-dimensional mean and covariance matrix, and let topics $\beta_{1:K}$ be $K$ multinomial distributions over a fixed word vocabulary. The generative process for an $N$-word documents is as follows:\cite{blei2006ctm}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw topic proportions $\eta | \{ \mu, \Sigma \} \sim  \text{LogisticNormal} (\mu, \Sigma)$.
    \item For each word $n$ in \{1...N\}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Draw topic assignment $z_n | \eta $ from Mult($f(\eta)$) 
        \item Draw word from that topic, $w_n | z_n,\beta_{1:K} $ from Mult($\beta_{z_n}$)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

where $f(\eta_i) = exp(\eta_i)/\sum_j exp(\eta_j)$.  


\paragraph*{STM}

Structural Topic Model (STM) is a general framework for topic modeling, which enables users to incorporate document-level covariate information. The goal of STM is to discover topics and estimate their relationship to document metadata, conducting hypothesis testing about these relationships. Thus, this method serves as bridge between statistical techniques and research goals. Like CTM, STM is a generative model of word counting, where a topic is defined as a mixture over words where each word has a probability of belonging to a topic. The \textit{stm} R package implements the estimation algorithms for the model \cite{stm}.  In the case of no covariates, the model reduces to a fast implementation of CTM. The document metadata can be incorporated in two ways: as topical prevalence, which refers to how much of a document is associated with a topic, and as topical content, related to the words used within a topic. The generative process is similar to CTM but incorporating the $p$ covariates in a 1-by-$p$ vector of document covariates $X_d$ for document $d$. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw topic distribution $\theta_d | X_d \gamma, \Sigma  \sim$ LogisticNormal($\mu = X_d \gamma, \Sigma$), where $\gamma$ is a $p$-by-$K-1$ matrix of coefficients and $\Sigma$ is $K-1$-by-$K-1$ covariance matrix.
    \item The probability on, per topic, word distribution is $\beta_{d,k}$. Given a document-level content variable $y_d$, the document-specific distribution $\beta_{d,k}$ is formed over words representing each topic ($k$) using the baseline word distribution ($m$), the topic specific deviation $\kappa_k$, the covariate group deviation $\kappa_{y_d}$ and the interaction between the two $\kappa_{y_d,k}$
    \begin{equation}
        \beta_{d,k} \propto e^{m + \kappa_k + \kappa_{y_d} + \kappa_{y_d,k} }
    \end{equation}
    \item  For each word $n$ in \{1...N\}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Draw topic assignment $z_n | \theta_d $ from Mult($\theta_d$) 
        \item Draw word from that topic, $w_n |  z_n,\beta_{1:K} $ from Mult($\beta_{z_n}$)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{A word comparison of the constitutional rights debate, at the municipality level. We show the emergent topics: Education, Equality, Security, and Environment for four different citizen participation determinants. Words are oriented along the X-axis based on how much they are associated to the inspected determinant. We note that for the topic Equality,  the word ``process'' comes from ``due process'' and ``treatment'' refers to ``behaviour towards''. Likewise, for the topic Security, ``door'' comes from ``revolving door'', which refers to inmate release and recidivism.}
