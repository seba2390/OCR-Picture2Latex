\section{Conclusion}
In this work, GeSn-based extended-SWIR vertical LEDs monolithically integrated on silicon have been demonstrated. The PIN heterostructure consisting of p-Ge$_{0.94}$Sn$_{0.06}$/i-Ge$_{0.91}$Sn$_{0.09}$/n-Ge$_{0.95}$Sn$_{0.05}$ layers was grown following a step-graded growth protocol to control their strain and content.  The obtained LEDs show an emission peak at a wavelength range of $2.45 - 2.58\,\mu$m depending on the injection current level and the LED device diameter. These LEDs have shown injection current density as low as $45$ Acm$^-2$ for a $120\,\mu$m diameter device and demonstrated both DC and qCW (AC) operation. The emitted power profile was found to be lambartian in shape and the highest emitted power was found to be $58$ nW at $\sim2.57\,\mu$m at an injection current of $100$ mA. These LEDs show a bandwidth that is most likely attributed to an increase in the carrier lifetime due to trapped photocarriers at the i-layer and p-layer interface. The demonstrated group IV GeSn-based LEDs are promising for on-chip integrated extended-IR light emitters for compact and cost-effective gas sensing and imaging applications. However, more work is needed to improve their structural properties and optimize their performance to reach emission powers sufficiently high to be relevant for practical applications.
