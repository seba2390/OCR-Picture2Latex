\abstract{
The angular distributions of lepton pairs in the Drell--Yan process can provide rich information
on the underlying QCD production mechanisms. These dynamics can be parameterised in 
terms of a set of frame dependent angular coefficients, $A_{i=0,\ldots,7}$, which depend on the 
invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity of the lepton pair.
%
Motivated by recent measurements of these coefficients by ATLAS and CMS, and in particular by the apparent 
violation of the Lam--Tung relation $A_0-A_2=0$, we perform a precision study of the angular coefficients at $\cO(\alphas^3)$ 
in perturbative QCD.
%
We make predictions relevant for $\Pp\Pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8~\TeV$, and perform comparisons 
with the available ATLAS and CMS data as well as providing predictions for a prospective measurement at LHCb.
%
To expose the violation of the Lam--Tung relationship we propose a new observable $\Delta^\mathrm{LT} = 1-A_2/A_0$ that 
is more sensitive to the dynamics in the region where $A_0$ and $A_2$ are both small.
We find that the $\cO(\alphas^3)$ corrections have an important impact on the $\ptz$ distributions for 
several of the angular coefficients, and are essential to provide an adequate description of the data.
%
The compatibility of the available ATLAS and CMS data is reassessed by performing a partial $\chi^2$ test 
with respect to the central theoretical prediction which shows that $\chi^2/N_\mathrm{data}$ is significantly 
reduced by going from ${\cO}(\alphas^2)$ to ${\cO}(\alphas^3)$.
