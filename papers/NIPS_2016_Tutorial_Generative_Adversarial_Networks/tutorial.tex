\section{Conclusion}

GANs are generative models that use supervised learning to approximate an intractable cost
function, much as Boltzmann machines use Markov chains to approximate their cost and VAEs
use the variational lower bound to approximate their cost.
GANs can use this supervised ratio estimation technique to approximate many cost functions, including the KL divergence used for maximum
likelihood estimation.

GANs are relatively new and still require some research to reach their new potential.
In particular, training GANs requires finding Nash equilibria in high-dimensional,
continuous, non-convex games.
Researchers should strive to develop better theoretical understanding and better training
algorithms for this scenario.
Success on this front would improve many other applications, besides GANs.

GANs are crucial to many different state of the art image generation and manipulation systems,
and have the potential to enable many other applications in the future.
