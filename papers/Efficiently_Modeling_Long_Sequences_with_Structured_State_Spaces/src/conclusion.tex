\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce \methodabbrv, a sequence model that uses a new parameterization for the state space model's continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional views to efficiently model LRDs in a principled manner.
Results across established benchmarks evaluating a diverse range of data modalities and model capabilities
suggest that \methodabbrv{} has the potential to be an effective general sequence modeling solution.
