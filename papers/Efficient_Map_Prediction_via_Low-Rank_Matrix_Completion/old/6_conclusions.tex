\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In typical coverage planning tasks, with limited power supply, a single agent may have to stop the mission with a partially observed feature map. Given this background, this paper proposes a map predictive coverage planning method by leveraging the theory of \textit{Low-Rank Matrix Completion}~(LRMC). We model the urban terrain map as a maze-like map and carefully illustrate how maze-like environments fit well into the LRMC model. Then with intensive experiments, we demonstrate our proposed map predictive method significantly outperforms other coverage planning baseline methods in terms of feature map coverage convergence.
