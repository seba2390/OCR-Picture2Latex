Coverage planning may end up with a partially revealed feature map if only single robot is available for operation and given energy supplies or the allowed action steps are quite limited. In this paper, with an assumption that the underlying feature map exhibits some special structures~(i.e., low-rank and incoherent structures), we propose a map predictive coverage planning method building upon the theory of \textit{Low-Rank Matrix Completion}. The proposed map prediction avoids the massive data for training compared with existing widely used map prediction methods, i.e., deep neural network based map predictions and is computationally cheap, and thus could be used for coverage planning in real-time. We have validated our approach via extensive simulated experiments, and the evaluations reveal that compared to other coverage planning techniques, not only our solution be able to predict the partial feature map, but also can achieve significantly faster coverage convergence~(per action step), even with severely degraded local sensing quality.
