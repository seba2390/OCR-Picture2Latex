In this paper, with an assumption that the underlying feature map exhibits some special structures~(i.e., low-rank and incoherent structures), we propose a novel map prediction method building upon the theory of \textit{Low-Rank Matrix Completion}. The proposed map prediction is able to achieve both map interpolation and extrapolation in maze-like environments simultaneously.   We validate with extensive simulated experiments that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art map prediction method --- Bayesian Hilbert Mapping in terms of mapping accuracy and computation time, and thus could be performed in real-time. Then we demonstrate that with our proposed real-time map prediction method, the coverage convergence~(per action step) for some typical coverage planning methods commonly used for environmental monitoring tasks can be significantly improved.
