\section{CONCLUSIONS}
We consider the map prediction problem encountered in an urban building layout mapping scenario, where the sensor measurements are noisy and sparse. We first model the underlying feature map as a maze map, which is proven to possess low-rank and incoherent structures. Then we propose to use \textit{Low-Rank Matrix Completion}~(LRMC) to perform the map prediction on maze-like environments. Our extensive experiments validate that (1) The LRMC method can simultaneously perform map interpolation and extrapolation; (2) The LRMC method outperforms another state-of-the-art mapping method---Bayesian Hilbert Mapping~(BHM) in terms of mapping accuracy and computation time and could update the entire feature map in real-time; (3) With our proposed real-time map prediction method, the coverage convergence of commonly used coverage planning methods in environmental monitoring could be substantially improved.
