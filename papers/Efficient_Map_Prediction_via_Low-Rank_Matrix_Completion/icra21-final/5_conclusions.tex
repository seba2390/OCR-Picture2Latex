\section{CONCLUSIONS}
We consider the map prediction problem where the measurements are noisy, sparse and partially observed. We first show that many maps possess low-rank and incoherent structures. Then we propose to use LRMC to perform the map prediction. Our extensive experiments validate that the LRMC method can effectively perform map prediction (interpolation and extrapolation), and the LRMC method outperforms  state-of-the-art Bayesian Hilbert Mapping in terms of mapping accuracy and computation time and could update the entire map in real-time. Lastly we show that the proposed real-time map prediction method can be easily combined with popular coverage planning methods and can significantly improve their coverage convergence rates.
