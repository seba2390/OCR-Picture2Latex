ratio of refactorings performed by the user in each mode on the open-ended tasks. Far left
represents all Traditional Mode refactorings; far-right indicates all \deuce{} Mode refactorings.
The 95\% confidence interval for the mean preference across all users is indicated (via percentile bootstrapping, 10,000 samples).}
