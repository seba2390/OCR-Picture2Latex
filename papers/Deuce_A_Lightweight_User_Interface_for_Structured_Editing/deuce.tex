\section{\deuce{}: Design and Implementation}
\label{sec:deuce}

In this section, we explain the design of \deuce{} in more detail.
First, we define a core language of programs where various structural
features can be selected.
Then, we describe a user interface that displays 
active transformations based on the set of structural selections.
Finally, we describe a set of general-purpose program transformations
that are provided in our current implementation.
