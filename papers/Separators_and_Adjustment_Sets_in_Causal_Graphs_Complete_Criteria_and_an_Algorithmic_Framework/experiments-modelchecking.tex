\caption{Model checking with parental or sparse basis sets for random DAGs. Here, $n$ denotes the number of nodes in the DAG, and $l$ denotes the expected number of neighbours of each node. The left panel shows the total size of the conditioning sets as a function of $n$, showing the expected quadratic increase. The right panel emphasizes that the benefit of using a sparse basis set is greatest if the graph is also sparse, in which case the total number of variables that need to be conditioned on can be reduced by up to 90\%.}
