Above, we provide you with a discharge summary and the instruction that the healthcare professional gave about the discharge summary.
You are also provided with \textcolor{red}{\{Number of Samples\}} corresponding responses from \textcolor{red}{\{Number of Samples\}} different clinical models.
Your task is to read the discharge summary and the instruction carefully, then find the answer to the instruction.
Then, compare your answer with each model's response and evaluate the response based on the following criteria.

Criteria : 

1. Unacceptable (1 point): The model's response includes any incorrect or irrelevant content. If the instruction was unanswerable, the model did not acknowledge this and outputs the wrong answer.

2. Poor (2 points): The model's response does not contain any incorrect or irrelevant content but omits significant or crucial content that the instruction is required for.

3. Satisfactory (3 points): The model's response does not contain any incorrect or irrelevant contents but omits minor or insignificant contents that the instruction is required for.

4. Excellent (4 points): The model's response contains all the necessary information that the instruction is requiring for. If the instruction was unanswerable, the model correctly acknowledged this and says that it was unanswerable.


When evaluating each score based on the above criteria, ensure that each judgment is not affected by the other model's response.

The first line must contain only \textcolor{red}{\{Number of Samples\}} values, which indicate the score for each model, respectively.
The \textcolor{red}{\{Number of Samples\}} scores are separated by a space.
Output scores without explanation.
