\section{CONCLUSIONS} \label{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we proved a sufficient condition to guarantee the convex hull property for general convex corridors in spatio-temporal frames. This theorem allows for using more complicated shapes to represent constraints as a form of spatio-temporal corridors. It was also shown that the uncovered search space can be shrunk to $O(\frac{1}{n^2})$ compared to $O(1)$ of trapezoidal corridors, which is the best possible result under continuity assumptions.
The use of general convex corridors yields less harsh brakes and enhanced the overall smoothness, specifically in scenarios involving objects with frequent acceleration/deceleration speed profile, which require more complex corridor shapes.
