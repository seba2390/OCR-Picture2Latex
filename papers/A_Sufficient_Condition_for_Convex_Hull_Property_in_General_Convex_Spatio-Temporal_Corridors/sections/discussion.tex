\section{Discussion} \label{Discussion}
This paper contains mainly two parts, a) deriving a sufficient condition for the convex hull property in spatio-temporal corridors, and b) estimating unsearched space. One can note that there is no continuity requirement for the concave upper bound function in a), but requires it to be twice differentiable in b). The requirement in b) can be relaxed to $C^{1}$ using Rolle's remainder of Taylor's theorem but the error is also weakened to $o(\frac{1}{n})$. Given the fact that the difference between the CPETS and the upper bound function is already $O(\frac{1}{n^2})$, we can not achieve better result than $O(\frac{1}{n^2})$.

In this research, the unsearched space is quantified as an order of magnitude instead of an analytical expression. An expression can be obtained by calculating the error each time applying an inequality in the proof of lemma \ref{lemma:mainLemmaDiff}.

This paper is based on Bezier curves, however, since B-spline curves are piece-wise Bezier curve, the theorems in this paper could potentially be extended to B-spline curves with some modifications.
