%Furthermore, it can also demonstrate that with the same computing resource usage, the Ensemble Fuzzers always performs better than any of base fuzzer, which means the generalization problem can be alleviated effectively through this simple ensemble approach, the robustness of Ensemble Fuzzer is better.
