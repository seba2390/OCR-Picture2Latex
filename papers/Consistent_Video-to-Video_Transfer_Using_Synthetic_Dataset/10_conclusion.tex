\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This research tackles the problem of text-based video editing. We have proposed a synthetic video generation pipeline, capable of producing paired data required for video editing. To adapt to the requirements of video editing, we have employed the model inflation technique to transform a single image diffusion model into a video diffusion model. As an innovation, we've introduced the Long Video Sampling Correction to ensure the generation of consistent long videos. Our approach is not only efficient but also highly effective. The user study conducted to evaluate the performance of our model yielded very high scores, substantiating the robustness and usability of our method in real-world applications.
