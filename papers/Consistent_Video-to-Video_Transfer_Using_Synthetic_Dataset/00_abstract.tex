We introduce a novel and efficient approach for text-based video-to-video editing that eliminates the need for resource-intensive per-video-per-model finetuning. At the core of our approach is a synthetic paired video dataset tailored for video-to-video transfer tasks. Inspired by Instruct Pix2Pix's image transfer via editing instruction, we adapt this paradigm to the video domain. Extending the Prompt-to-Prompt to videos, we efficiently generate paired samples, each with an input video and its edited counterpart. Alongside this, we introduce the Long Video Sampling Correction during sampling, ensuring consistent long videos across batches. Our method surpasses current methods like Tune-A-Video, heralding substantial progress in text-based video-to-video editing and suggesting exciting avenues for further exploration and deployment. \url{https://github.com/amazon-science/instruct-video-to-video/tree/main}

Our method adopts a one-model-all-video strategy, achieving comparable performance while necessitating only inference. \ours\, eliminates the need to specify prompts for both original and target videos, simplifying the process by requiring only an edit prompt, thereby enhancing intuitiveness in video editing.}
