\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our HiDialog provides a \emph{simple yet effective} approach to fill the gap between general corpus pre-training and dialogue understanding, without extra computational cost and training data while maintaining decent performance. Therefore, we anticipate that it could serve as a compelling baseline or plug-in module for future work in the community.
