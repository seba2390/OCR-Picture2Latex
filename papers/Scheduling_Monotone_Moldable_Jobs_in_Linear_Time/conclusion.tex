\section*{Conclusion}

We have presented several techniques to exploit monotony of jobs,
mostly based on the ability to compress wide jobs.
For two different algorithms we demonstrated that these techniques can help to reduce the running time
from polynomial in~$m$ to polynomial in~$\log m$.
We also showed that arbitrarily good approximation guarantees can be achieved in polynomial time.
On the negative side, we proved the \cclass{NP}-hardness of scheduling monotonic jobs.
It remains open whether a better approximation guarantee than~$\frac{3}{2}$
can be achieved efficiently, e.g.~in the form of an EPTAS.
