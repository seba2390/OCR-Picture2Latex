We applied self-supervised discrete representations for the task of speech resynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated the efficiency of disentangled representations for signal reconstruction, voice conversion, and F0 manipulation. Our evaluations shed light on the properties encoded by each method in the context of speech synthesis. Finally, we adapt the HuBERT speech representation as an ultra lightweight speech codec, providing superior subjective results than the baselines with lower bitrate.

% For future work, we would like to extend the following method for expressive speech synthesis, including emotion and style conditioning. Moreover, we would like to improve the study on self-supervised speech codecs to be applied over in-the-wild and noisy-reverberent datasets.
