We theoretically and empirically evaluated symbolic search for cost-optimal planning with expressive extensions. 
%
First, we analyzed the search behavior of symbolic heuristic search in form of \bddastar{} and revealed an unknown or at least often overlooked fundamental problem: We showed that using a heuristic does not always improve the search performance of \bddastar{}.
In general, even the perfect heuristic can deteriorate search performance exponentially.
%
Second, we analyzed classical planning with different expressive extensions, such as planning with axioms and derived variables, planning with state-dependent action costs, oversubscription planning, and top-$k$ planning.
The discussed and presented results on the computational complexity and compilability of these planning formalisms show that native support for the relevant planning extensions is needed to solve many real-world problems.
Based on this observation, we proposed symbolic blind search to solve such planning formalisms with expressive extensions. 
More specifically, we have proposed symbolic search approaches that provide optimal, sound, and complete algorithms for these planning formalisms. 
Our empirical evaluations show that the presented symbolic search approaches perform favorably in all these planning settings compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. 
Finally, we analyzed the combination of all these classical planning extensions, i.e., top-$k$ oversubscription planning with axioms and state-dependent action costs, and show how symbolic search with the introduced modifications can support this planning formalism.
