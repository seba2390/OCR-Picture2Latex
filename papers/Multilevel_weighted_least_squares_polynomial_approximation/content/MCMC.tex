%\Cref{pro:stability} shows that if the optimal densities $\optimaldensity_{l}$ associated to a sequence $(\vsp_l)_{l\in\N}$ of polynomial spaces converge to a limit $\optimaldensity_{\infty}$ in an appropriate sense, then we may use samples from $\optimaldensity_{\infty}\measure$ for all $l$ without changing the asymptotic behavior of the approximation error. Next, we study conditions under which such a limit exists. Furthermore, even when no limit exists, we derive upper and lower bounds on $\optimaldensity$ that are independent of the polynomial space. A lower bound on $\optimaldensity$ allows to get rid of the weight $\sqrt{\weight(\psmi)}=1/\sqrt{\optimaldensity}$ in the definition of $e_{\vsp,\infty}(\rs)$ in \Cref{eq:bestlinf}, thus making it easier to verify bounds on this quantity in practice. An upper bound on $\optimaldensity$ allows for the application of Markov Chain methods to obtain samples from $\optimaldensity\measure$.

%To extend \Cref{alg:MCMC} to measures on $\R^d$, the arcsine distribution $\arcsine$ needs to be replaced by one supported on all of $\R$. For example, it is known that if $\measure$ is Gaussian, then the sampling measure $\density_m\measure$ concentrates on an interval of size $[-a_m,a_m]$ with $a_m\approx m^{1/2}$ \cite{}.
