{\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a novel multilevel projection method for the approximation of response surfaces using multivariate polynomials and random samples with different accuracies. For this purpose, we have discussed and analyzed various sampling methods for the underlying single-level approximation method. We have then presented theoretical and numerical results on our multilevel projection method for problems in which samples can be obtained at different accuracies. The numerical results show good agreement with the computational gains predicted by our theory. Future work will address the application to problems in uncertainty quantification with infinite-dimensional parameter domains and multi- or infinite-dimensional quantities of interest.}
