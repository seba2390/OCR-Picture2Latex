\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}
In this paper, we present a new filter-based stereo visual inertial state estimation algorithm that uses the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of our Stereo Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (S-MSCKF) using the EuRoC dataset as well as autonomous flight experiments in indoor and outdoor environments, comparing the computational efficiency and performance with state-of-art methods. We show that the S-MSCKF achieves robustness with a modest computational budget for aggressive, three-dimensional maneuvering, fast flight of speeds up to  $17.5$m/s, indoor/outdoor transition, and indoor navigation in cluttered environments. Finally, we describe the S-MSCKF implementation which is available at \url{https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio}.

Since the global position and yaw is not observable in a VIO system as explained in Section~\ref{subsec: observability constraint}, the uncertainty of the corresponding directions will keep growing as the robot travels. It can be observed in the experiments that the filter estimation may jump or even diverge once the prior uncertainty is large. Our future work is addressing the possibility of planning intelligent trajectories for a quadrotor such that the growth in uncertainty of the VIO estimator is slower, which then helps extend the effective range of the robot.
