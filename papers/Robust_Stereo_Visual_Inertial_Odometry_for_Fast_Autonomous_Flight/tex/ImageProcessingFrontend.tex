\subsection{Image Processing Frontend}
\label{subsec: image processing frontend}
In our implementation, the FAST~\cite{trajkovic1998fast} feature detector is employed for its efficiency. Existing features are tracked temporally using the KLT optical flow algorithm~\cite{lucas1981iterative}. It is shown in~\cite{paulcomparative} that descriptor-based methods for temporal feature tracking are better than KLT-based methods in accuracy. In our experiments, we find that descriptor-based methods require much more CPU resource with small gain in accuracy, making such methods less favorable in our application. Note that we also use the KLT optical flow algorithm for stereo feature matching, which further saves computation compared to descriptor-based methods. Empirically, corner features with depths greater than $1$m can be reliably matched across the stereo images using KLT tracking with a $20$cm baseline stereo configuration. Two types of outlier rejection procedure are implemented in the image processing frontend. A 2-point RANSAC is applied to remove outliers in temporal tracking. In addition, a circular matching similar to~\cite{kitt2010visual} is performed between the previous and current stereo image pairs to further remove outliers generated in the feature tracking and stereo matching steps.
