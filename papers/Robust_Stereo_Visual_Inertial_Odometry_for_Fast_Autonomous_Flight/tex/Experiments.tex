In order to evaluate the proposed method, three different kinds of experiments were performed. First, the proposed method was compared with  state-of-art visual inertial odometry algorithms including OKVIS~\cite{leutenegger2015keyframe}, ROVIO~\cite{bloesch2015robust}, and VINS-MONO~\cite{vins-mono} on the EuRoC dataset~\cite{burri2016euroc}. Second, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm on high speed flights reaching maximum speeds of $17.5$m/s on a runway environment. In both of the experiments, the loop closure functionality of VINS-MONO is disabled in order to just compare the odometry of different approaches. Note that although all of the algorithms used in the comparison are capable of estimating extrinsic parameters between the IMU and camera frames online, the offline calibration parameters are provided in the experiments for optimal performance. Finally, we show a representative application of the proposed S-MSCKF in an experiment that combines estimation, with control and planning for autonomous flight in an unstructured and unknown environment which includes a warehouse, a wooded area and a runway.
