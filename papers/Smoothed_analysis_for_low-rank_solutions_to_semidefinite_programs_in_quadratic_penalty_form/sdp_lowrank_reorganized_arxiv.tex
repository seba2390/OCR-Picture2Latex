\begin{abstract}
Semidefinite programs (SDP) are important in learning and combinatorial optimization with numerous applications. In pursuit of low-rank solutions and low complexity algorithms, we consider the Burer--Monteiro factorization approach for solving SDPs. We show that all approximate local optima are global optima for the penalty formulation of appropriately rank-constrained SDPs as long as the number of constraints scales sub-quadratically with the desired rank of the optimal solution. Our result is based on a simple penalty function formulation of the rank-constrained SDP along with a smoothed analysis to avoid worst-case cost matrices. We particularize our results to two applications, namely, Max-Cut and matrix completion. 




%Existing results for such factorization-based techniques either apply to a restricted class of problems or are not guaranteed to converge in polynomial-time. In this work, we show that Burer--Monteiro factorization can be applied to a large class of SDPs, and show that we can find approximate global optima for appropriately rank-constrained SDPs as long as the number of constraints scales sub-quadratically with the desired rank of the optimal solution. Our result is based on a simple penalty function formulation of SDP along with a smoothed analysis to avoid worst-case cost matrices. We particularize our results to two applications, namely, Max-Cut and matrix completion.

\section{Conclusions and perspectives}\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we considered the Burer--Monteiro factorization to solve SDPs~\eqref{eq:factored}. In addition to dimensionality reduction, one advantage of such formulations is that algorithms for them necessarily produce positive semidefinite solutions of rank at most $k$. An ideal theorem would state that some polynomial-time algorithm computes approximate optima for~\eqref{eq:factored} in all cases with reasonably small $k$. In this regard, we now review what we achieved, what seems impossible and what remains to be done.

Because problem~\eqref{eq:factored} has nonlinear constraints, our first step was to move to a penalized formulation~\eqref{eq:penalty_factored}. For simplicity, we chose to work with a quadratic penalty. Quadratic penalties may require pushing $\mu$ to infinity to achieve constraint satisfaction at the optimum. Taking $\mu$ large may prove challenging numerically. In practice, it is known that augmented Lagrangian formulations (ALM) behave better in this respect~\citep{birgin2014ALM}. Thus, a first direction of improvement for the present work is to tackle ALM formulations instead.

Second, we established in Section~\ref{sec:exact} that for almost all SDPs, all exact SOSPs of~\eqref{eq:penalty_factored} are global optima which map to global optima of the penalized SDP~\eqref{eq:penalty_sdp} provided $\frac{k(k+1)}{2} > m$, where $m$ is the number of constraints. It should not be possible to improve the dependence on $k$ by much since certain SDPs admit a unique solution of rank $r$ such that $\frac{r(r+1)}{2} = m$. We showed in Section~\ref{sec:exact_sub} that for certain SDPs the penalty formulation~\eqref{eq:penalty_factored} admits suboptimal SOSPs. This suggests that even in the ideal statement stated above one may need to exclude some SDPs.

Third, we showed in Section~\ref{sec:smooth} that upon perturbing the cost matrix $C$ randomly (to avoid pathological cases), with high probability and provided $k = \tilde \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ (which is the right order though constants and dependence on other parameters could certainly be improved), when SOSPs have bounded residues (which is the case for positive definite cost matrices and for compact SDPs up to a technical modification), all SOSPs of the factored, penalized and perturbed problem are approximately optimal for that problem. This is achieved through smoothed analysis, which we believe is an appropriate tool to deal with the pathological cases exhibited above. These results can be further improved by deducing approximate constraint satisfaction and optimality for the original SDP~\eqref{eq:sdp}---which we currently do not do---and by further relaxing conditions on the SDP.

Finally, we studied the applicability of our results to two applications: Max-Cut and matrix completion. While these particularizations do not always improve over the specialized solvers for these problems, we believe that the work done here in studying low-rank parameterization of SDPs will be a helpful step towards building up to faster methods.
