We provide a novel game-theoretic approach to interpretable temporal modeling. The game articulates how the predictor accuracy can be traded off against locally agreeing with a simple axiomatically interpretable explainer. The work opens up many avenues for future work, from theoretical analysis of the co-operative games to estimation of interpretable unfolded trajectories through GANs.
