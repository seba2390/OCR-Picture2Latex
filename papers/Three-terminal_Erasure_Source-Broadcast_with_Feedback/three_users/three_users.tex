\section{Coding for Three Users}
\label{sec:three_users}

%We next propose a coding scheme for the case of three users.  
Our proposed coding scheme consists of two distinct parts and is described within Sections~\ref{subsec:instantly_decodable} and \ref{subsec:non_instant_coding} respectively. The first part involves only transmissions that are instantly decodable and distortion-innovative for all users, while the second part is executed if we are no longer able to send additional packets of this sort.  In~\cite{TMKS_TIT20}, the benefits of transmitting instantly decodable, distortion-innovative packets was explored.  In summary, a channel symbol is said to be instantly-decodable, distortion-innovative if any successfully received channel symbol can be immediately used to reconstruct a single source symbol that was hitherto unknown~\cite{TMKS_TIT20}.  In addition to minimizing decoding delays, incorporating such symbols is advantageous since if each user $i$ receives only such symbols for $wN$ transmissions, then they will all simultaneously be able to achieve their optimal distortion $D^{*}(\epsilon_i, w) \triangleq 1 - w(1 - \epsilon_i)$, which is obtained from the source-channel separation theorem.  This is because precisely $wN(1 - \epsilon_i)$ channel symbols are received after $wN$ transmissions have been made, and so if each transmission involved an instantly-decodable, distortion-innovative symbol, then $D^{*}(\epsilon_i, w)$ can trivially be achieved.


When we are no longer able to continue sending instantly-decodable, distortion-innovative symbols however, we describe two alternative approaches for the second part of our coding sheme.  In Section~\ref{subsec:channel_coding}, we propose a channel coding scheme that optimizes over the common and private messages we can channel-code to the group of users in order for their distortion constraints to be met.  Alternatively, in Section~\ref{subsubsec:chaining_algorithm}, we describe a \emph{chaining algorithm} that can be used instead whereby the transmitter targets point-to-point optimal performance for two users as if they were the only users in the network. Meanwhile, the third user simultaneously builds ``chains'' of symbols that he may at times be able to decode based on the channel conditions, and the subsequent reception of additional symbols.  

%the encoder serves only two users in the network, however, the third user can potentially decode some of the messages.
