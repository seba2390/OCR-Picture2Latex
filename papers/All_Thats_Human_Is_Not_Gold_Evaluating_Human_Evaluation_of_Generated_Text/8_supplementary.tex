\subsection{Priming Texts}\label{sup:exemplars}
When generating the text passages, we conditioned the text on three in-domain, human-authored texts. The exact passages we used for each domain are in Tables \ref{tab:story_exemplars}--\ref{tab:recipe_exemplars}.

Once upon a time magic was an art. The great magicians of the time would take on apprentices who would train for a decade or more, slaving under their tutelage for the hope of one day being the next great magician. They were free from the bonds of apprenticeship only once they had made the perfect magic circle. Only then could they harness the power of the mages and go off on their own. But times changed, magicians were persecuted, and few longed to toil away for the long years of study necessary. In the course of a century, magic became extinct. \\

She was as you'd expect an old woman to be in most respects, brittle and stooped as though whatever foundation still held her old bones up might break at any minute and cause the whole abode to come tumbling down. Her eyes were glazed like a bakers treats - what they'd come to call cataracts in years to come. Her joints were all swollen, such that her fingers were like poorly balanced, chubby spiders from a children's tale.

After the Zoo’s last river otter passed away in 2019 from advanced age, the Zoo engaged in long-planned improvements to the otter habitat. With renovations complete, Tahu has joined the Zoo family and will be joined by a male companion in the future. As a species, river otters have suffered from habitat loss, water pollution, and fur trapping. Their numbers are on the rise due to reintroduction programs in parts of the U.S., better water quality, and protection of their habitats. Zoo Director Gregg Dancho said, ``Our river otters have always been some of the most popular animals who make their home here at the Zoo, for their playful nature and intelligence as well as their role as an iconic North American animal.\end{tabular} \\

The anticipated \$30-million project and its targeted completion date of 2023 was announced Monday by Paulus Development, the Syracuse-based firm that renovated the former Ansco factory on Binghamton's West Side into a multi-unit apartment building. The developers acquired the Johnson City parcel at 59 Lester Ave. in March. Matthew Paulus, president of Paulus Development, said the apartments will contain modern amenities and enclosed parking, along with 7,500 square feet of retail space. It's anticipated renters would include young professionals and empty-nesters among others.
