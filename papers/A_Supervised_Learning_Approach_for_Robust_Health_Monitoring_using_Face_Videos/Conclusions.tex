\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}

The monitoring of the health parameters like PR and PRV is important to keep a check on the individual's health and spot the potential cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the use of device-free methods such as using camera videos is preferred over contact methods like pulse oximeters for such measurement. In this paper, we proposed a two-fold methodology wherein a supervised learning technique is leveraged to predict the pulse rate. The physiological parameters are remotely predicted using the video of human faces captured using a laptop's camera. The subtle changes in the face pixels intensity over the different frames of the video are exploited to train a neural network with three hidden layers. Experimental evaluations are performed for twenty subjects, and the proposed approach demonstrates significant improvement as compared to the baselines thus validating that the approach has the potential to be applied in real scenarios.
