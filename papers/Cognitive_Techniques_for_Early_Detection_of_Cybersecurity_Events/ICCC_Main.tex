\begin{abstract}
The early detection of cybersecurity events such as attacks is challenging given the constantly evolving threat landscape. Even with advanced monitoring, sophisticated attackers can spend as many as 146 days\footnote{\url{https://thebestvpn.com/cybersecurity-statistics-2018/}} in a system before being detected. This paper describes a novel, cognitive framework that assists a security analyst by exploiting the power of semantically rich knowledge representation and reasoning with machine learning techniques. Our Cognitive Cybersecurity system ingests information from textual sources, and various agents representing host and network based sensors, and represents this information in a knowledge graph. This graph uses terms from an extended version of the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology. The system reasons over the knowledge graph to derive better actionable intelligence to security administrators, thus decreasing their cognitive load and increasing their confidence in the system. We have developed a proof of concept framework for our approach and demonstrate its capabilities using a custom-built ransomware instance that is similar to WannaCry.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have described the design and implementation of a cognitive system to detect cybersecurity events. Our technique assimilates and interprets often incomplete textual information from a variety of sources such as security bulletins, CVE's and blogs, and represents it as a knowledge graph using terms from the Unified Cybersecurity Ontology. It represents the data from traditional host and network sensors, as well as any analysis generated by machine learning techniques,  in the same knowledge graph. It reasons over this knowledge to detect cybersecurity events. We also developed a proof of concept CCS system which features a cognitive dashboard where cybersecurity events are reported to the security analysts. Our technique reduces the cognitive load on the analyst to interpret complex events occurring in large enterprises by fusing information from multiple sources and reasoning over it much like a human analyst. The capability of our system is demonstrated by testing it against a custom built ransomware, which uses the SMB vulnerability to infect victims similar to the infamous WannaCry ransomware. In ongoing work, we are
analyzing the scalability of our system by adding more sensors and concepts that define the behavior of various processes running on typical networks.
