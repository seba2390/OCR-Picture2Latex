\begin{abstract}
Spiral Galaxies is a pencil-and-paper puzzle played on a grid of unit squares: given a set of points called \emph{centers}, the goal is to partition the grid into polyominoes such that each polyomino contains exactly one center and is $180^\circ$ rotationally symmetric about its center.
We show that this puzzle is NP-complete, ASP-complete, and \#P-complete even if
(a)~all solutions to the puzzle have rectangles for polyominoes; or
(b)~the polyominoes are required to be rectangles and
all solutions to the puzzle have just
$1\times1$, $1\times3$, and $3\times1$ rectangles.
The proof for the latter variant also implies NP/ASP/\#P-completeness of finding a noncrossing perfect matching in distance-$2$ grid graphs where edges connect vertices of Euclidean distance~$2$.
Moreover, we prove NP-completeness of the design problem of minimizing the number of centers such that there exists a set of galaxies that exactly cover a given shape.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}





Spiral Galaxies is a pencil-and-paper puzzle published by Nikoli since 2001~\cite{n-sg-01} under the name ``Tentai Show''~\cite{gsp-18}. It is played on a grid of unit squares with given ``centers'' --- points located at grid vertices, cell centers, or edge midpoints. The goal is to decompose the grid into polyominoes called ``galaxies'' such that each galaxy contains exactly one center and is $180^\circ$ rotationally symmetric about its center; see Figure~\ref{fig:sg-ex}(a). The solution for a Spiral Galaxies puzzle may not be unique, but typically puzzles are designed to have a unique solution.

Friedman~\cite{f-sgpnp-02} proved Spiral Galaxies NP-complete for general polyomino galaxies.
His proof uses galaxies of area up to $22$.
Fertin et al.~\cite{fjk-tagsg-15} proved NP-completeness for galaxies of area at most $7$, while the puzzle becomes solvable in polynomial time if galaxies are restricted to have area at most $2$ or to be squares.
How much simpler can we make the galaxy shapes and still have Spiral Galaxies puzzles be NP-complete?

In this paper, we consider Spiral Galaxies with rectangular galaxies,
in two possible senses:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item In \defn{Rectangular Galaxies}, the polyomino galaxies are
  required to be rectangles.  This is an additional restriction on the puzzle
  beyond $180^\circ$ rotational symmetry around the unique center
  contained in each rectangle.
\item Spiral Galaxies puzzles designed so that all their solutions
  (if any) have rectangular galaxies.  In other words, we have a
  \emph{promise} that all solutions are rectangular.
\end{enumerate}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:sg-ex}(b) shows an example of a Spiral Galaxies puzzle where
the unique solution is rectangular, so it is a valid input to either
Rectangular Galaxies or rectangular-promise Spiral Galaxies.

We prove that both of these puzzle variants are NP-complete and ASP-complete,
and that the corresponding problem of counting the number of solutions is
\#P-complete.
(Refer to~\cite[Chapter 28]{v-aa-10} and~\cite{y-ccfas-03,ys-ccfas-03} for definitions of \#P-completeness and ASP-completeness, respectively.)
In fact, hardness of rectangular-promise Spiral Galaxies implies
hardness of Rectangular Galaxies.
For Rectangular Galaxies,
we further show that the problem remains NP/ASP/\#P-complete
even when all solutions use only $1\times1$, $1\times3$, and $3\times1$
rectangles (a stronger promise),
and hence also if the puzzle is restricted to use only such rectangles.
This special case is in some sense the smallest interesting scenario:
if we restrict to only $1\times1$, $1\times2$, and $2\times1$ rectangles,
then each center determines the shape of its containing polyomino
(of area $1$ or $2$ depending on whether the center is at a cell center
or edge midpoint, respectively), making puzzles easy to solve.
Our proof for $1\times1$, $1\times3$, and $3\times1$ rectangles
also establishes NP-completeness of finding a noncrossing matching in ``distance-2 grid graphs'', whose vertices are a subset of the integer lattice and whose edges connect vertices at Euclidean distance exactly~$2$. %in grid graphs with edge length $2$ 

 
In another variant of the puzzle, a subset of the centers is colored black, and the polyominoes that contain these centers reveals a picture once solved~\cite{gsp-18}; see Figure~\ref{fig:sg-ex}(c). Logic puzzles whose solutions yield pictures are a popular genre; one famous example is the nonogram~\cite{ueda96}. Such Spiral Galaxies puzzles are also the subject of a mathematical fonts~\cite{add-sgf-17}. Constructing an interesting puzzle such that its solution is a given target shape is nontrivial: while a valid puzzle trivially exists, by simply placing a center in every grid cell, the resulting puzzle is clearly not interesting.
We are thus also interested in finding the minimum number of centers such that there exist galaxies that exactly cover a given shape. We prove this puzzle design problem to be NP-complete. %This variant
%Black and white centers are used by Anderson et al.~\cite{add-sgf-17} to create a Spiral Galaxies font.

\subsection{Organization}

The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:sgr}, we prove that Spiral Galaxies is NP/ASP/\#P-complete when all solutions use rectangular galaxies.
In Section~\ref{sec:sgr13}, we show that Rectangular Galaxies is NP/ASP/\#P-complete when all solutions use rectangular galaxies of dimensions $1\times1$, $1\times3$, and $3\times1$.
In Section~\ref{sec:match}, we relate this problem to finding noncrossing perfect matchings in distance-2 grid graphs, proving NP/ASP/\#P-completeness of the latter.
In Section~\ref{sec:nrc}, we show that minimizing the number of centers when generating a puzzle with a given output shape is NP-hard.
In Section~\ref{sec:puzz}, we discuss the possibility of allowing multiple solutions in Spiral Galaxies puzzles, and we investigate a small puzzle related to a Spiral Galaxies font.
Finally, we conclude in Section~\ref {sec:conclusion}.

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We showed that both Rectangular Galaxies and rectangular-promise Spiral Galaxies are NP/ASP-complete even if the polyominoes are restricted to be rectangles of arbitrary size---and that counting the number of solutions is \#P-complete. Moreover, we proved that Rectangular Galaxies remains NP/ASP/\#P-complete even when only $1\times1$, $1\times3$, and $3\times1$ rectangles are possible. With the proof of the latter variant, we also showed that finding a noncrossing matching in distance-2 grid graphs is NP-complete. %Moreover, we show that the problem of counting the number of solutions for the latter variant is \#P-complete and ASP-complete. 
Finally, we proved NP-completeness of the design problem of finding the minimum number of centers such that there exist galaxies that exactly cover a given shape. The complexity of the latter problem when we aim for unique solutions remains open.
