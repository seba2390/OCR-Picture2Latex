Standard Spiral Galaxies puzzles are designed to have a unique solution, with the intent that the puzzle solver finds that one solution.
In this section, we briefly explore the possibility of creating a single puzzle with \emph{multiple} solutions, such that each solution forms a different desired picture.
As a case study, we ask for a single puzzle such that, for every letter of the alphabet, there exists a solution to the puzzle that resembles that letter.
In Figure~\ref{fig:letter-puzzle}, we provide a puzzle which has a solution for the black letters A, B, H, P, R, S, Z (and when we allow for \emph{disconnected} galaxies also for the letter E). 
See Figure~\ref{fig:letter-puzzle-sol} for the solutions.

While our construction has solutions for several letters, for most letters of the alphabet it does not, and it also has many additional solutions which do not resemble letters at all.
We leave as an open problem to construct puzzles which either solve for more letters, or for fewer nonletters, or both.
More generally, this raises the question of whether it is possible to create puzzles with multiple solutions in such a way that \emph{every} valid solution forms a meaningful picture.
