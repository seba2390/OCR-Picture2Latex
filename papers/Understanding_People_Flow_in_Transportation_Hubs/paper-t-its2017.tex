% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we aim to monitor the flow of people in large public infrastructures. 
        We propose an unsupervised methodology to cluster people flow patterns into the most typical and meaningful configurations. By processing 3D images from a network of depth cameras, we build a descriptor for the flow pattern. We define a data-irregularity measure that assesses how well each descriptor fits a data model. This allows us to rank flow patterns from highly distinctive (outliers) to very common ones. By discarding outliers, we obtain more reliable key configurations (classes).
    Synthetic experiments show that the proposed method is superior to standard clustering methods.
        We applied it in an operational scenario during 14 days in the X-ray screening area of an international airport. 
    Results show that our methodology is able to successfully summarize the representative patterns for such a long observation period, providing relevant information for airport management. 
    Beyond regular flows, our method identifies a set of rare events corresponding to uncommon activities (cleaning, special security and circulating staff).
