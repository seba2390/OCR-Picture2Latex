\section{Conclusion}

We looked at the \hds problem and gave a sufficient condition for hypergraphic sequences.
In particular, we proved that there is a subset of hypergraphic sequences having size at least $2^{\frac{(n-1)\cdot (n-2)}{2}}$ which is efficiently recongnizable.
It would be interesting to look at the hypergraphic sequences which are not {\em cyclic hyper degrees}, these sequences may be helpful in finding hardness reductions for it.
Lastly, it would be interesting to further study the structure of {\em cyclic hyper degrees}.
