\begin{abstract}
Similar vulnerability repeats in real-world software products because of code reuse, especially in wildly reused third-party code and libraries. 
Detecting repeating vulnerabilities like 1-day and N-day vulnerabilities is an important cyber security task. 
Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art methods suffer from poor performance because they detect patch existence instead of vulnerability existence and infer the vulnerability signature directly from binary code. 
In this paper, we propose \name to extract precise vulnerability-related binary instructions to generate the vulnerability-related signature.
\name detects vulnerability existence based on binary signatures.
Unlike previous approaches, \name accurately locates vulnerability-related instructions by utilizing source and binary codes. 
Our experiments were conducted using over 1000 vulnerable instances across seven open-source projects.  
\name significantly outperformed the baseline tools Asm2vec and Palmtree. 
Besides the performance advantages over the baseline tools, \name offers a better feature by providing explainable reasons during vulnerability detection. 
Our empirical studies demonstrate that \name detects fine-grained vulnerability that the state-of-the-art tools struggle with. Our experiment on commercial firmware demonstrates \name is able to find vulnerabilities in real-world scenario.
