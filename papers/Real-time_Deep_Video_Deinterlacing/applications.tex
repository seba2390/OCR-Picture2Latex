Our methods can be used in various applications including: 1080i HDTV deinterlacing, legacy DVD video enhancement, live broadcasting, etc..
\subsection{1080i HDTV Deinterlacing}
There are two types of HDTV format: $1080i$ and $1080p$.
The resolution of $1080i$ and $1080p$ are both $1920\times1080$ resulting in $2.1$ million pixels.
However, due to the limitation of transferring bandwidth, $1080i$ is still widely used currently.
When we watch HDTV on a tablet or pc screen, the $1080i$ signal is first converted into $1080p$ using traditional deinterlacing methods.
We can also apply our method to deinterlacing $1080i$ videos.
Some results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hdtv_results}.
There videos originally recorded using $1080i$ format, therefore it contains interlacing artifacts.
We can see our method can effective deinterlace $1080i$ videos.
\subsection{Legacy DVD Video Enhancement}
Legacy DVD vdieos are usually recorded using interlaced format.
When we want to enhance these legacy videos, deinterlacing is usually the first step.
For example, the motion deblur usually requires to estimate point-spread-function using the local information.
The estimation accuracy can be highly reduced without deinterlacing.
We apply our method on legacy DVDs videos, including movies and cartoon animations.
Some results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1080i_results}.
%To have a good user experience when wearing a virtual reality glasses, the framerate and the resolution of rendered frames must be at least $50FPS$ and $4K$ respectively. However, this consume heavy computation costs.
%Using our methods can reduce the half of the computation while doubling the FPS.
\subsection{Live Broadcasting}
Broadcasting has been very popular recently last year.
However, the uplink speed of Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) usually is limited.
For example, if the donwlink speed is $50M$ and the uplink speed is $4M/8=512kpbs$.
It can only upload $512K$ byte data per second.
However, for an image of resolution $1080\times720$, its size is $189.84375K$ Byte without compression.
Using our methods can reduce half of the frame rates at the cost of little image quality deduction.
