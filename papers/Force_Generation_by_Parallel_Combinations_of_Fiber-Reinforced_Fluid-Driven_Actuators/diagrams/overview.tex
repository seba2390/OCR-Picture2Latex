\caption{\revcomment{2.3}{(a) A fiber-reinforced elastomerc enclosure (FREE) is a soft fluid-driven actuator composed of an elastomer tube with fibers wound around it to impose specific deformations under an increase in volume, such as extension and torsion. (b) A linear actuator and motor combined in \emph{series} has the ability to generate 2 dimensional forces at the end effector (shown in red), but is constrained to motions only in the directions of these forces. (b) Three FREEs combined in \emph{parallel} can generate the same 2 dimensional forces at the end effector (shown in red), without imposing kinematic constraints that prohibit motion in other directions (shown in blue).}}
