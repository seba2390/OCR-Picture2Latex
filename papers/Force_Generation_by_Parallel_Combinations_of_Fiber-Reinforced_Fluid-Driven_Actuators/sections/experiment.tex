\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiment}
To demonstrate the viability of our modeling methodology, we show experimentally how through the deliberate combination and configuration of parallel FREEs, full control over 2DOF spacial forces can be achieved by using only the minimum combination of three FREEs.
To this end, we carefully chose the fiber angle $\Gamma$ of each of these actuators to achieve a well-balanced force zonotope (Fig.~\ref{fig:rigDiagram}).
We combined a contracting and counterclockwise twisting FREE with a fiber angle of $\Gamma = 48^\circ$, a contracting and clockwise twisting FREE with $\Gamma = -48^\circ$, and an extending FREE with $\Gamma = -85^\circ$.
All three FREEs were designed with a nominal radius of $R$ = \unit[5]{mm} and a length of $L$ = \unit[100]{mm}.

    The FREEs were carefully selected to yield a well-balanced force zonotope (bottom) to gain full control authority over $F^{\hat{z}_e}$ and $M^{\hat{z}_e}$.
    To this end, we used one extending FREE, and two contracting FREEs which generate antagonistic moments about the end effector $z$-axis.}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
To measure the forces generated by this actuator combination under a varying state $\vec{x}$ and pressure input $\vec{p}$, we developed a custom built test platform (Fig.~\ref{fig:rig}). 
%
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/photos/rig_labeled.pdf}
    \caption{\revcomment{1.3}{This experimental platform is used to generate a targeted displacement (extension and twist) of the end effector and to measure the forces and torques created by a parallel combination of three FREEs. A linear actuator and servomotor impose an extension and a twist, respectively, while the net force and moment generated by the FREEs is measured with a force load cell and moment load cell mounted in series.}}
    \label{fig:rig}
\end{figure}
%
In the test platform, a linear actuator (ServoCity HDA 6-50) and a rotational servomotor (Hitec HS-645mg) were used to impose a 2-dimensional displacement on the end effector. 
A force load cell (LoadStar  RAS1-25lb) and a moment load cell (LoadStar RST1-6Nm) measured the end-effector forces $F^{\hat{z_e}}$ and moments $M^{\hat{z_e}}$, respectively.
During the experiments, the pressures inside the FREEs were varied using pneumatic pressure regulators (Enfield TR-010-g10-s). 

The FREE attachment points (measured from the end effector origin) were measured to be:
\begin{align}
    \vec{d}_1 &= \bmx 0.013 & 0 & 0 \emx^T  \text{m}\\
    \vec{d}_2 &= \bmx -0.006 & 0.011 & 0 \emx^T  \text{m}\\
    \vec{d}_3 &= \bmx -0.006 & -0.011 & 0 \emx^T \text{m}
%    \vec{d}_i &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 0 \emx^T , && \text{for } i = 1,2,3
\end{align}
All three FREEs were oriented parallel to the end effector $z$-axis:
\begin{align}
    \hat{a}_i &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 1 \emx^T, \hspace{20pt} \text{for } i = 1,2,3
\end{align}
Based on this geometry, the transformation matrices $\bar{\mathcal{D}}_i$ were given by:
\begin{align}
    \bar{\mathcal{D}}_1 &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & -0.013 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \emx^T  \\
    \bar{\mathcal{D}}_2 &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 1 & 0.011 & 0.006 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \emx^T  \\
    \bar{\mathcal{D}}_3 &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 1 & -0.011 & 0.006 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \emx^T 
%    \bar{\mathcal{D}}_i &= \bmx 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \emx^T , && \text{for } i = 1,2,3
\end{align}
These matrices were used in equation \eqref{eq:zeta} to yield the state-dependent fluid Jacobian $\bar{J}_x$ and to compute the resulting force zontopes.
%while using measured values of $\vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{meas}} (\vec{q}, \vec{P})$ and $\vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{meas}} (\vec{q}, 0)$ in \eqref{eq:fiberIso} yields the empirical measurements of the active force.



\subsection{Isolating the Active Force}
To compare our model force predictions (which focus only on the active forces induced by the fibers)
to those measured empirically on a physical system, we had to remove the elastic force components attributed to the elastomer. 
Under the assumption that the elastomer force is merely a function of the displacement $\vec{x}$ and independent of pressure $\vec{p}$ \cite{bruder2017model}, this force component can be approximated by the measured force at a pressure of $\vec{p}=0$. 
That is: 
\begin{align}
    \vec{f}_{\text{elast}} (\vec{x}) = \vec{f}_{\text{\,meas}} (\vec{x}, 0)
\end{align}
With this, the active generalized forces were measured indirectly by subtracting off the force generated at zero pressure:
\begin{align}
    \vec{f} (\vec{x}, \vec{p})  &= \vec{f}_{\text{meas}} (\vec{x}, \vec{p}) - \vec{f}_{\text{meas}} (\vec{x}, 0)     \label{eq:fiberIso}
\end{align}


%To validate our parallel force model, we compare its force predictions, $\vec{\zeta}_{\text{pred}}$, to those measured empirically on a physical system, $\vec{\zeta}_\text{meas}$. 
%From \eqref{eq:Z} and \eqref{eq:zeta}, the force at the end effector is given by:
%\begin{align}
%    \vec{\zeta}(\vec{q}, \vec{P}) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \bar{\mathcal{D}}_i \left( {\bar{J}_V}_i^T(\vec{q_i}) P_i + \vec{Z}_i^{\text{elast}} (\vec{q_i}) \right) \\
%    &= \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n \bar{\mathcal{D}}_i {\bar{J}_V}_i^T(\vec{q_i}) P_i}_{\vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{fiber}} (\vec{q}, \vec{P})} + \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^n \bar{\mathcal{D}}_i \vec{Z}_i^{\text{elast}} (\vec{q_i})}_{\vec{\zeta}^{\text{elast}} (\vec{q})}   \label{eq:zetaSplit}
%     &= \vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{fiber}} (\vec{q}, \vec{P}) + \vec{\zeta}^{\text{elast}} (\vec{q})
%\end{align}
%\Dan{These will need to reflect changes made to previous section.}
%The model presented in this paper does not specify the elastomer forces, $\vec{\zeta}^{\text{elast}}$, therefore we only validate its predictions %of the fiber forces, $\vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{fiber}}$. 
%We isolate the fiber forces by noting that $\vec{\zeta}^{\text{elast}} (\vec{q}) = \vec{\zeta}(\vec{q}, 0)$ and rearranging \eqref{eq:zetaSplit}
%\begin{align}
%    \vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{fiber}} (\vec{q}, \vec{P})  &= \vec{\zeta}(\vec{q}, \vec{P}) - \vec{\zeta}(\vec{q}, 0)     \label{eq:fiberIso}
%%    \vec{\zeta}^{\,\text{fiber}}_{\text{emp}} (\vec{q}, \vec{P})  &= \vec{\zeta}_{\text{emp}}(\vec{q}, \vec{P}) - %\vec{\zeta}_{\text{emp}}(\vec{q}, 0)
%\end{align}
%Thus we measure the fiber forces indirectly by subtracting off the forces generated at zero pressure.  


\subsection{Experimental Protocol}
The force and moment generated by the parallel combination of FREEs about the end effector $z$-axis  was measured in four different geometric configurations: neutral, extended, twisted, and simultaneously extended and twisted (see Table \ref{table:RMSE} for the exact deformation amounts). 
At each of these configurations, the forces were measured at all pressure combinations in the set
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{P} &= \left\{ \bmx \alpha_1 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_3 \emx^T p^{\text{max}} \, : \, \alpha_i = \left\{ 0, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, 1 \right\} \right\}
\end{align}
with $p^{\text{max}}$ = \unit[103.4]{kPa}. 
\revcomment{3.2}{The experiment was performed twice using two different sets of FREEs to observe how fabrication variability might affect performance. The results from Trial 1 are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:results} and the error for both trials is given in Table \ref{table:RMSE}.}



\subsection{Results}

\input{diagrams/resultsDiag.tex}
For comparison, the measured forces are superimposed over the force zonotope generated by our model in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}a-~\ref{fig:results}d.
To quantify the accuracy of the model, we defined the error at the $j^{th}$ evaluation point as the difference between the modeled and measured forces
\begin{align}
%    \vec{e}_j &= \left( {\vec{\zeta}_{\,\text{mod}}} - {\vec{\zeta}_{\,\text{emp}}} \right)_j
%    e_j &= \left( F/M_{\,\text{mod}} - F/M_{\,\text{emp}} \right)_j
    e^F_j &= \left( F^{\hat{z}_e}_{\text{pred}, j} - F^{\hat{z}_e}_{\text{meas}, j} \right) \\
    e^M_j &= \left( M^{\hat{z}_e}_{\text{pred}, j} - M^{\hat{z}_e}_{\text{meas}, j} \right)
\end{align}
and evaluated the error across all $N = 125$ trials of a given end effector configuration.
% using the following metrics:
% \begin{align}
%     \text{RMSE} &= \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} e_j^2}{N} } \\
%     \text{Max Error} &= \max \{ \left| e_j \right| : j = 1, ... , N \}
% \end{align}
As shown in Table \ref{table:RMSE}, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is less than \unit[1.5]{N} (\unit[${8 \times 10^{-3}}$]{Nm}), and the maximum error is less than \unit[3]{N}  (\unit[${19 \times 10^{-3}}$]{Nm}) across all trials and configurations.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/photos/buckling.pdf}
    \caption{At high fluid pressure the FREE with fiber angle of $-85^\circ$ started to buckle.  This effect was less pronounced when the system was extended along the $z$-axis.}
    \label{fig:buckling}
\end{figure}

%Experimental precision was limited by unmodeled material defects in the FREEs, as well as sensor inaccuracy. While the commercial force and moment sensors used have a quoted accuracy of 0.02\% for the force sensor and 0.2\% for the moment sensor (LoadStar Sensors, 2015), a drifting of up to 0.5 N away from zero was noticed on the force sensor during testing.

It should be noted, that throughout the experiments, the FREE with a fiber angle of $-85^\circ$ exhibited noticeable buckling behavior at pressures above $\approx$ \unit[50]{kPa} (Fig.~\ref{fig:buckling}). 
This behavior was more pronounced during testing in the non-extended configurations (Fig.~\ref{fig:results}a~and~\ref{fig:results}c). 
The buckling might explain the noticeable leftward offset of many of the points in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}a and Fig.~\ref{fig:results}c, since it is reasonable to assume that buckling reduces the efficacy of of the FREE to exert force in the direction normal to the force sensor.
