% context
The compliant structure of soft robotic systems enables a variety of novel capabilities in comparison to traditional rigid-bodied robots.
A subclass of soft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems.
FREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a rigid structure.
Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety of force and moment combinations.
In this paper we explore the potential of combining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully controllable multi-dimensional soft actuation.
% object
To this end, we propose a novel methodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft actuators as a function of their internal pressure.
This methodology relies on the notion of a state dependent \emph{fluid Jacobian} that yields a linear expression for force. We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces that can be generated by a soft system in a given state.
This \emph{force zonotope} can be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft actuators.  
% findings
The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel combination of three carefully designed actuators constrained to a 2DOF test platform.
The force predictions matched measured values with a root-mean-square error of less than \unit[1.5]{N} force and \unit[$\mathbf{8 \times 10^{-3}}$]{Nm} moment, demonstrating the utility of the presented methodology.
