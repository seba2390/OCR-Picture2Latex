\section*{Acknowledgements}
The authors would like to thank an anonymous reviewer of a previous version of this work for an unusually thoughtful and helpful review, which aided us in improving the document â€” in particular, for pointing out the idea of correlated rounding. Further, the authors would like to thank Jannik Matuschke for noticing that the weighted matroid rank function falls into the class of gross substitutes.
