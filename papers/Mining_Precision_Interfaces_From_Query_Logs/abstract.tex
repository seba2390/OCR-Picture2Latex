Interactive tools make data analysis both more efficient and more accessible to a broad population.  Simple interfaces such as Google Finance as well as complex visual exploration interfaces such as Tableau are effective because they are tailored to the desired user tasks. Yet, designing interactive interfaces requires technical expertise and domain knowledge. Experts are scarce and expensive, and therefore it is currently infeasible to provide tailored (or {\it precise}) interfaces for every user and every task.

We envision a data-driven approach to generate tailored interactive interfaces. We observe that interactive interfaces are designed to express sets of programs; thus, samples of programs---increasingly collected by data systems---may help us build interactive interfaces.  Based on this idea, {\it Precision Interfaces} is a language-agnostic system that examines an input query log, identifies how the queries {\it structurally change}, and generates interactive web interfaces to express these changes.  The focus of this paper is on applying this idea towards logs of structured queries.  Our experiments show that \sys can support multiple query languages (SQL and SPARQL), derive Tableau's salient interaction components from OLAP queries, analyze $<75k$ queries in $<12$ minutes, and generate interaction designs that improve upon existing interfaces and are comparable to human-crafted interfaces.

%in \sys can process two query languages, SQL and SPARQL, and can derive Tableau's salient interaction components from a set of OLAP queries.  Simple optimizations reduce the runtime by up to 2OOM, enabling it to analyze a log of $>75k$ queries and build an interface in $<12 minutes$.  Finally, our user study suggests that generated interfaces can improve on existing in-the-wild interfaces while producing interaction designs comparable to human-crafted interfaces.

% Interactive visualizations help make data analysis accessible and more efficient to a broad population. However, designing such interactive interfaces relies on domain experts with the technical expertise to design appropriate interfaces.  Yet, designing interactive interfaces requires expertise in both engineering and in the application domain. Experts are scarce and expensive, and therefore it is currently infeasible to provide tailored (or precise) interfaces for every user and every task.

Precision Interfaces is a system that examines an input program log, identifies how programs structurally change, and generates interactive web interfaces to express these structural changes. We show that our system can process two query languages, SQL and SPARQL, and that it can derive the salient interaction components of Tableau from a set of OLAP queries. Additionally we present optimizations that
