% We now focus on \sys{}'s efficiency. Our aim is to understand where \sys{}'s bottlenecks are and how we address them. We use two publicly available datasets. The first one, \emph{SDSS}, contains 125,603 SQL queries (112,847 of which are unique) collected in the context of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\footnote{\texttt{http://www.sdss.org/}}. The second one, \emph{British Museum}, contains 38,933 unique SPARQL queries (110,677 with duplicates) posed to the British Museum's Semantic Web Collection\footnote{http://collection.britishmuseum.org/}. By default, we run \sys{} with all optimizations enabled. We created 16 PI-Lang statements for SDSS, and 4 statements for British Museum.
