    \caption{{Overview of our strategy discovery framework. The Stage 1 Bayesian Diversity Search algorithm explores a low-dimensional feature vector of the take-off states to discover multiple jumping strategies. The output strategies from Stage 1 and their corresponding take-off states are taken as input to warm-start further training in Stage 2, which encourages novel policies that lead to additional visually distinct strategies. Both stages share the same DRL training component, which utilizes a P-VAE to improve the motion quality and a task curriculum to gradually increase the learning difficulty.}}
