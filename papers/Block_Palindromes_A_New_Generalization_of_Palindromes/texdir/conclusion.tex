\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we investigated several properties of block palindromes which are the generalization of palindromes and gapped palindromes.
We also proposed an optimal-algorithm to enumerate all maximal block palindromes appearing in a given string.
As mentioned in Remark~\ref{lem:limited-center-block},
if we impose a limitation on the lengths of center blocks,
the upper bound of the number of maximal block palindromes is reduced to $O(\NN)$,
where $\NN$ is the length of an input string.
In particular, for maximal block palindromes of even size, the center blocks are super restricted to be empty.
The situation is similar to considering ordinal palindromes (in which the center blocks are strict)
versus maximal gapped palindromes (in which the restriction on the center blocks are relaxed).
It would be interesting to investigate the properties of maximal block palindromes whose center blocks have restricted lengths
and develop efficient algorithms to enumerate only such a subset of maximal block palindromes.
