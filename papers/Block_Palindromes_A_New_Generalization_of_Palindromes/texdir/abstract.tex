We study a new generalization of palindromes and gapped palindromes called \emph{block palindromes}.
A block palindrome is a string that becomes a palindrome when identical substrings are replaced with a distinct character.
We investigate several properties of block palindromes and
in particular, study substrings of a string which are block palindromes.
In so doing, we introduce the notion of a \emph{maximal block palindrome},
which leads to a compact representation of all block palindromes that occur in a string.
We also propose an algorithm which enumerates all maximal block palindromes that appear in a given string $\T$ in $O(|\T| + \|\MBP(\T)\|)$ time, where $\|\MBP(\T)\|$ is the output size,
which is optimal unless all the maximal block palindromes
can be represented in a more compact way.
