\begin{abstract}
Remote code disclosure attacks threaten embedded systems as
they allow attackers to steal intellectual property or
to find reusable code for use in control-flow hijacking attacks.
Execute-only memory (XOM)
prevents remote code disclosures, but existing XOM solutions either
require a memory management unit that is not available
on ARM embedded systems or incur significant overhead.

We present \emph{\System}: a fast and novel XOM system for
ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M devices which leverages ARM's
Data Watchpoint and Tracing unit along with the processor's
simplified memory protection hardware.  On average,
{\System} incurs 0.33\% performance overhead and 5.89\% code size
overhead on two benchmark suites and five real-world applications.
