This paper presented {\System}: a fast and novel XOM system for
ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M devices which leverages ARM's MPU and
DWT unit.
{\System} incurs an average performance overhead of 0.33\% and an average
code size
overhead of 5.89\% on the BEEBS and CoreMark-Pro benchmark suites and
five real-world applications.

In future work, we will investigate techniques to ensure that
randomization techniques utilizing {\System} are effective
against brute-force attacks.  Embedded systems have limited code placement
options for code layout randomization, motivating us to
investigate whether the entropy is sufficient and develop
techniques to strengthen code randomization if necessary.
We will also explore how to leverage debug support like DWT to enforce
other security policies with low overhead.
