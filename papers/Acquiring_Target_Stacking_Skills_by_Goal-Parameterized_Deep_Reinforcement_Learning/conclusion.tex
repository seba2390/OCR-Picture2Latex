\section{Conclusion}
We create a synthetic block stacking environment with physics simulation in which the agent can learn block stacking end-to-end through trial and error, bypassing to explicitly model the corresponding physics knowledge. 

We introduce a target stacking task where the agent stacks blocks to reproduces a tower shown in an image. The task presents a distinct type of challenge requiring the agent to reach a given goal state that may be different for every new trial. 
Therefore we propose a goal-parametrized GDQN model to plan with respect to the specific goal, allowing better generalization across different goals.
We validate the model on both a navigation task in a classic gridworld environment with different start and goal positions and the block stacking task itself with different target structures. Our proposed model shows good performance on both tasks.
