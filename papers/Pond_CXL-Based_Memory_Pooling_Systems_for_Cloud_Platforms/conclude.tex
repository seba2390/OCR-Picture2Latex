DRAM costs are an increasing cost factor for cloud providers.
This paper is motivated by the observation of stranded and untouched memory across 100 production cloud clusters.
We proposed \sys, the first full-stack memory pool that satisfies the requirements of cloud providers.
\sys
comprises contributions at the hardware, system software, and
distributed system layers.
Our results showed
that \sys can reduce the amount of needed DRAM by 7\% with a pool size of 16 sockets and assuming CXL increases latency by 222\%.
This translates into an overall reduction of 3.5\% in cloud server cost.

%% Datacenter-scale memory disaggregation has strigent requirements to be
%% practical for production deployment, yet existing memory disaggregation
%% designs fall short to achieve so. Motivated by quantitative measurements
%% of stranded and frigid memory at a major cloud platform, we propose the
%% first CXL-based end-to-end memory disaggregation design. Powered by
%% accurate prediction-based VM memory provisioning, \sys can reduce DRAM
%% requirements by 9\% across 100 clusters without affecting the
%% performance for 98\% of all VMs.
