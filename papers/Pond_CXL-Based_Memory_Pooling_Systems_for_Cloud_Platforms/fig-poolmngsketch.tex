% For simplicity and
% performance, \sys pools are not cache coherent. Consequently,
\newtxt{\sys assigns pool memory to at most one host at a time.
This example shows \sys's asynchronous memory release strategy which engages when a VM departs ($t$=1 and $t$=2).
During VM scheduling, memory is added to the corresponding host before the VM starts ($t$=3 and $t$=4).}}
