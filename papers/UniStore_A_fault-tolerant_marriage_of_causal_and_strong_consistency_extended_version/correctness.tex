\section{Proof of Correctness}
\label{sec:correctness}

We have rigorously proved that \System correctly implements the specification of
PoR consistency for the case when the data store manages last-writer-wins registers. The
proof uses the formal framework
from~\cite{sebastian-book,distrmm-popl,framework-concur15} and establishes
Properties~\ref{prop:knownvc}-\ref{prop:stablevcred} stated earlier. Due to
space constraints, we defer the proof
to~\tr{\ref{section:correctness-proof}}{\nappproof}.
