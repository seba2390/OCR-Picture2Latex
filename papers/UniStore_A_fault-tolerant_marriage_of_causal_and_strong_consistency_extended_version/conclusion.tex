\section{Conclusion}

This paper presented \System, the first fault-tolerant and
scalable data store that combines causal and strong
consistency. \System carefully integrates state-of-the-art scalable protocols and extends
them in nontrivial ways. To maintain liveness despite data
center failures, unlike previous work, \System commits a strong transaction only when all its
causal dependencies are uniform. Our results show that
\System combines causal and strong
consistency effectively: 3.7$\times$
lower latency on average than a strongly consistent system with 1.2ms
latency on average for causal transactions.
We expect that the key ideas in \System will pave
the way for practical systems that combine causal and strong
consistency.
