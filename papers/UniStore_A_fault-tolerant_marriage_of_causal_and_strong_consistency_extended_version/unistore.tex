\begin{abstract}
Modern online services rely on data stores that replicate their data across
geographically distributed data centers. %
Providing strong consistency in such data stores results in high latencies and
makes the system vulnerable to network partitions.
The alternative of relaxing consistency violates crucial correctness properties.
A compromise is to allow multiple consistency levels to
coexist in the data store. In this paper we present \System, the first fault-tolerant and
scalable data store that combines causal and strong consistency.
The key challenge we address in \System is to maintain liveness despite data
center failures: this could be compromised if a strong transaction takes a
dependency on a causal transaction that is later lost because of a failure.
\System ensures that such situations do not arise while paying the cost of
durability for causal transactions only when necessary.
We evaluate \System on Amazon EC2 using both microbenchmarks and a
sample application. Our results show that
\System effectively and scalably combines causal and strong
consistency.
