\begin{abstract}
Distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems executing mixed
criticality task sets are increasingly being deployed in mobile and
embedded cloud computing platforms, including space applications.
These DRE systems must not only operate over a range of temporal and
spatial scales, but also require stringent assurances for secure
interactions between the system's tasks without violating their
individual timing constraints. 
\iffalse
Not only do these
environments illustrate a range of temporal and spatial scales over
which the DRE system must operate, they also require stringent
assurances on the secure communications between the interacting
distributed tasks of the DRE system in a way that does not violate the
timing constraints of the individual tasks.  
\fi
To address these challenges, this paper describes a novel
distributed operating system focusing on the
scheduler design to support the mixed criticality task sets. 
% We also describe the theoretical 
%foundations for allocating the mixed criticality task to different
%scheduling groups.
  Empirical results from experiments involving a
case study of a cluster of satellites emulated in a laboratory
testbed validate our claims.
