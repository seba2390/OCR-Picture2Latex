% Abstract -----------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}
  \noindent
A search for \CP violation in the decay \LbTopKMuMu is presented.
This decay is mediated by flavour-changing neutral-current transitions in the Standard Model and is potentially sensitive to new sources of \CP violation.
The study is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions recorded with the \lhcb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\invfb$.
%The signal yield after all selection requirements is found to be $600\pm 44$ events.
The \LK decay is observed for the first time, and
two observables that are sensitive to different manifestations of \CP violation are measured, \mbox{$\DACP \equiv \mathcal{A}_{\CP}(\LbTopKMuMu)-\mathcal{A}_{\CP}(\LbTopKJPsi)$} and \aCPTodd, where the latter is based on asymmetries in the angle between the $\mup \mun$ and $p\Km$ decay planes. These are measured to be
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{align*}
\DACP &= (-3.5\; \pm 5.0\;(\mathrm{stat})\; \pm 0.2\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2},\\
\aCPTodd &= (\phantom{+}1.2 \;\pm 5.0\;(\mathrm{stat}) \;\pm 0.7\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2},
\end{align*}
and no evidence for \CP violation is found.
%We use the high statistics  $\Lb\to pK^- J/\psi$ decay  as a control sample.
%This represents the first observation of \LbTopKMuMu decays and in this analysis a precision to $CP$-violating asymmetries of about $5\times 10^{-2}$ was achieved.

%
%The author list for journal publications is provided by the Membership Committee shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been given.
%%It will be made available on the page
%%\verb!http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~strauman/forMemCo/LHCb-PAPER-XXXX-XXX/! .
%It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number has beens assigned.
%The author list should be included already at first circulation, 
%to allow new members of the collaboration to verify whether they have been included correctly.
%Occasionally a misspelled name is corrected or associated institutions become full members.
%In that case, a new author list will be sent to you.
%In case line numbering doesn't work well after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after the last author to a separate line.

%  author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
