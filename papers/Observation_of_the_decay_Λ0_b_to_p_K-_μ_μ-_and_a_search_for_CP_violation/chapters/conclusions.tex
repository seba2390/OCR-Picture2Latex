\section{Conclusions}
The first search for \CP violation in the process \LK is performed with a data sample containing $600\pm 44$ signal decays, this representing the first observation of this \Lb decay mode.
%This represents the first observation of this rare electroweak penguin decay in the $b$-baryonic sector.
Two different \CP-violating observables that are sensitive to different manifestations of \CP violation, \DACP and \ACP, are measured.
%These correspond to \DACP, the phase-space integrated \CP-violating asymmetry measured with respect to the control mode \LKJ,
%and the \ACP observable, derived from triple-product asymmetries. 
The parity-violating observable \aPTodd is also measured. The values obtained are
\begin{align}
\DACP &=  (-3.5 \pm 5.0\;(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.2\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2}, \nonumber\\[1.5ex]
%\AT &= (-2.8 \pm 7.2\;(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 1.0\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2}, \nonumber\\[1.5ex]
%\ATbar &= (4.0 \pm 6.9\;(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 1.0\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2}, \nonumber\\[1.5ex]
\ACP &= (\phantom{-}1.2 \pm 5.0\;(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.7\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2}, \nonumber\\[1.5ex]
\aPTodd &= (-4.8 \pm 5.0\;(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.7\;(\mathrm{syst}))\times 10^{-2}.\nonumber
\end{align}
The results are compatible with \CP and parity conservation and agree with SM predictions for \CPV~\cite{Alok:2011gv,Paracha:2014hca}, and with experimental results~\cite{LHCB-PAPER-2014-032,Lees:2012tva} for decays mediated by $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ transitions in \Bz and \Bp meson decays.
