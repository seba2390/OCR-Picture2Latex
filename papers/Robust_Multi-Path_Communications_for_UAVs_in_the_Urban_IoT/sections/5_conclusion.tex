In this paper, we developed a robust communication framework for UAVs operating in congested urban environments. The framework builds a multi-hop multi-path infrastructure used to connect the Ground Control Station to the UAVs. The paths are dynamically selected based on beacon messages that are periodically broadcasted over all the paths.
Experimental results shows that the proposed framework considerably improves the reliability and effectiveness of control against local congestion.
