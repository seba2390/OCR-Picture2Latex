\section{Conclusion}

The sophistication of recent attacks  on UAVs \cite{dronhack},
automobiles \cite{ris_rts_1, checkoway2011comprehensive}, medical devices
\cite{security_medical} as well as an industrial control systems \cite{stuxnet}, indicates that RTS are becoming more vulnerable. In this paper we are making steps towards the development of a comprehensive framework to integrate security mechanisms and  provide a glimpse of \textit{security design metrics} for RTS. Designers of RTS are now able to improve their security posture, which will also improve overall \textit{safety} â€“ and that is essentially the main goal of such systems.
