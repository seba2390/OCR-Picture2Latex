We examine a challenging variant of active learning where target data is scarce, and multiple shifted domains operate as the source set of unlabeled data.
For practitioners facing multi-domain active learning, we benchmark 18 acquisition functions, demonstrating the $\mathcal{H}$-Divergence family of methods and our proposed variant \dale{} achieve the best results.
Our analysis shows the importance of example selection in existing methods, and also the surprising potential of domain budget allocation strategies.
Combining families of methods, or trying domain adaptation techniques on top of selected example sets, offer promising directions for future work.
