\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents a novel penalty-based method to numerically simulate interactions between in-contact rigid bodies, with applications to robotic grasping. A simple, computationally inexpensive method is provided to assess the overlap between objects. The information gathered is in turn exploited to define apposite interaction efforts, designed to ensure the overlap remains a transient occurrence. Contact efforts are computed to offer a reflection of the mechanical stiffness of real-life collisions. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method stably simulates a range of grasping scenarii, including detailed objects and multi-pronged grippers. A comparison to a constraint-based approach, in multiple grasping situations, further illustrates the merit of the proposed approach. In particular it illustrates the fact that, in the simulated scenarii, the proposed method allows to achieve physically plausible results, whereas the constraint-based approach failed to do so.
% Due to adding a transient temporal gain multiplier, our approach mirrors real-life mechanical stiffness more accurately than existing penalty-approaches (see \sec{introduction}).
Work is being invested in integrating the existing approach within the Human Brain Project's NeuroRobotic Platform (NRP, \cite{knoll2016}), to extend its capacities in terms of robust grasping simulation.
