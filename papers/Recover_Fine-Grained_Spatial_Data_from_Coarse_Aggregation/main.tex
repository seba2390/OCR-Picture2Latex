\begin{abstract}
	%With the almost universal adoption of mobile devices in modern society, enormous amount of behavioral traces data are generated. One such kind of data is the cell phone activities records and its distribution. 
	%We study a challenging problem of reconstructing fine-grained spatial densities from coarse-grained measurements, i.e., the aggregate observations recorded for each subregion in a spatial field of interest. 
	In this paper, we study a new type of \emph{spatial sparse recovery} problem, that is to infer the fine-grained spatial distribution of certain density data in a region only based on the aggregate observations recorded for each of its subregions.
	One typical example of this spatial sparse recovery problem is to infer spatial distribution of cellphone activities based on aggregate mobile traffic volumes observed at sparsely scattered base stations.  
	We propose a novel \emph{Constrained Spatial Smoothing} (CSS) approach, which exploits the local continuity that exists in many types of spatial data to perform sparse recovery via finite-element methods, while enforcing the aggregated observation constraints through an innovative use of the ADMM algorithm. We also improve the approach to further utilize additional geographical attributes.
	%Understanding the spatial distribution of cell phone activities is not only of great value for telecommunication companies to conduct resource planning, but also provides insights into the study of human activity and the underlying urban ecology. However, in reality, due to technical overhead and privacy concerns related to mobile phone tracking, cell phone activity data with a fine-grained geographical distribution are not always available.
	Extensive evaluations based on a large dataset of phone call records and a demographical dataset from the city of Milan show that our approach significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches, including Spatial Spline Regression (SSR).
%	Though a bunch of research works have been done based on cell phone activities, such kind of data is actually highly rare due to both technical overhead and privacy issues. Instead of having access to the distribution of cell phone activities on a whole region, in reality, usually only the aggregated volumes of cell phone activities associated with base stations that sparsely distributed within a region are observable. Therefore, how to infer the spatial distribution of cell phone activities from sparse aggregated observations is a very important problem.
%	In this paper, we study the problem of inferring cell phone activity distributions from aggregated sparse observations. We formulate the problem as sparse recovery and propose a new Constrained Spatial Smoothing approach. Our approach exploits the smoothness property of cell phone activities distribution to perform sparse spatial recovery. Besides, it is also able to incorporate external information as a regression add-on to further enhance recovery performance. Furthermore, we propose an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm to decouple the problem and learn model parameters effectively.
