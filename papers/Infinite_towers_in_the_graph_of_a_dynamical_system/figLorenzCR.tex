 \caption{{\bf A periodic window in the bifurcation diagram of the Poincar\'e map of the Lorenz system}.
 This figure is placed here for comparison with the very similar Fig.~\ref{fig:p3} for the logistic map. 
 More information about the Lorenz system and its Poincar\'e map is given in the text.
 This window runs from $\rhoo\simeq208.520$ to $\rhoo\simeq209.453$. 
 There is a rectangle in the right side of Fig.~\ref{fig:lfull}(top) that represents the area shown here. There one can see that the red Cantor set and the attractor have components for $y$ outside of the range shown here and there is another attractor. 
 Several nodes that are unstable Cantor sets are shown in red and blue.
