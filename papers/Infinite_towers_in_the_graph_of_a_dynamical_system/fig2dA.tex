 \caption{{\bf Attractors of the Poincar\'e Map of the Lorenz system.} 
    The pictures above show the attractor of the Poincar\'e map of the Lorenz system  in the $(x,y)$ plane for five different values of $\rhoo$. 
    Whenever the trajectory hits the $z=r-1$ plane, a point is plotted, in blue if $z$ is decreasing and otherwise in red.
    There are places where the color switches from blue to red, due to the vector field being tangent to the plane. 
    In all pictures $x$ ranges from $-40$ to $40$ and $y$ ranges from $-100$ to $100$. 
    Each panel is the plot of a single trajectory, hence low density regions of the attractor may not be represented or it may only be represented by a few isolated points.
    There are two steady states on this plane (Eq.~\ref{eq:ss}). 
    They are indicated with black dots.
