\caption{\small {\bf Pose error as a function of the object position.} The performance of the 2D loss clearly degrades for objects near the image center, whereas that of our 3D loss doesn't. See Fig.~\ref{fig:cube_problem}(b) for the underlying geometry. Note that as the object moves closer to the image boundary, it becomes truncated, which degrades the performance of both losses.}
