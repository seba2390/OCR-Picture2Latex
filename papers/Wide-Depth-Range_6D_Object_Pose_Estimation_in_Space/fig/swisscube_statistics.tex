    \caption{{\bf The depth distribution of the target object in datasets.} 
    Nearly 80\% of the SPEED dataset is located in the depth range of 1 to 5 times the object diameter. As contrast, our Swisscube dataset is uniformly distributed among the depth range approximately. Here, the depth is in the unit of times of the diameter of the target object, and note that, we do not have the accurate 3D object model of SPEED, its diameter is approximately computed from a 3D reconstruction. \YH{Suppose to remove this figure, no space}
