  In this paper we formulate and analyze a space-time finite element
  method for the numerical simulation of rotating electric machines where
  the finite element mesh is fixed in space-time domain.
  Based on the Babu\v{s}ka--Ne\v{c}as theory we prove unique solvability
  both for the continuous variational formulation and for a standard Galerkin
  finite element discretization in the space-time domain. This approach
  allows for an adaptive resolution of the solution both in space and time,
  but it requires the solution of the overall system of algebraic equations.
  While the use of parallel solution algorithms seems to be mandatory,
  this also allows for a parallelization simultaneously in space and time.
  This approach is used for the eddy current approximation of the Maxwell
  equations which results in an elliptic-parabolic interface problem.
  Numerical results for linear and nonlinear constitutive material relations
  confirm the applicability, efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
  approach.
