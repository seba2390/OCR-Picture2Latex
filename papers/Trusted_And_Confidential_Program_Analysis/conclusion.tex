In this paper, we have highlighted the trusted and confidential program 
analysis (\tcpa) as a trustless technology to achieve agreed regulatory compliance 
on software among multiple parties without revealing sensitive information 
about it. We designed the protocol of \tcpa for trusted execution 
environments and developed \tool as the very first implementation of \tcpa. 
In our preliminary evaluation with \wasm benchmark files, \tool demonstrated the 
potential to handle complicated cases without incurring too much overhead. 
Further instantiation of \tcpa with new types of program analysis and trusted computing 
solutions is left for future work. We hope that with the rapid development of new TEEs, there will be convergence on a 
security model that serves \tcpa well. We have shown that on AMD SEV, it is already a serious proposition.
