			The network is designed to encourage the registration and completion network branches to mutually cooperate to be consistent, and thereby regularizes both the (global)  registration and completion problems. Here, we show the result of the combined registration and completion of two partial scans, with little overlap, of a real scan of a toy airplane.}
