  \caption{Visual comparisons of our CTF-Net to other registration methods on different overlap data. The input pair of partial parts is shown in the first row. To better illustrate the overlap region, we show the input pair in the second row after rotating each part into a canonical view, and mark the overlap region with a lighter color. Next four rows show the registration results provided by 4PCS, DCP, PRNet and ours respectively. Here we only show the registration results that takes the blue part as the anchor.}
