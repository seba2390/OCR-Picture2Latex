  \caption{The prediction results on real scans. The first column shows the photo of each real object. The next two columns show the paired partial inputs. The fourth and fifth columns are the registered results, which take each part as an anchor. The fifth and sixth columns show the completion results. The complete fused shape from a much denser RGB-D sequences are shown in the last column for comparison.}
