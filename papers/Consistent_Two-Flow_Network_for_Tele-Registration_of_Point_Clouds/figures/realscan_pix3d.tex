  \caption{The prediction results on RedWood (upper 4 rows) and Pix3D (lower 4 rows) datasets. The first column shows the photo of each real model, and the next two columns show the paired partial inputs. The fourth and fifth columns are the registered results with either part as the anchor, and the completion results are shown in the following two columns. The last column shows the corresponding reconstructed meshes provided by these two datasets.}
