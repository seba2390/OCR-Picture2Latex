  \caption{The prediction results of CTF-Net. The first two columns show the input pairs (colored in blue and orange). The third and fourth columns show the registration results from \textit{C-R flow}, where the corresponding original mesh is shown in transparent gray to better display the relative position of the registered parts. The fifth and sixth columns show the completion results from \textit{R-C flow}, and the last two columns are the ground truth point clouds.}
