\caption{The architecture of CTF-Net. Given a pair of partial scans, CTF-Net simultaneously predicts the transformation parameters for registration and coordinates of points for completion. The prediction follows a mirrored manner, which performs \textit{register-and-complete(R-C)} in one flow and \textit{complete-and-register(C-R)} in another. The \textit{R-C flow} and \textit{C-R flow} are denoted by green and purple lines respectively. These two flows mutually reinforce each other by enhancing consistency on their outputs, which is represented by gray lines.}
