In this work, we demonstrate that
in-hand manipulation skills learned with RL in a simulator can achieve an unprecedented
level of dexterity on  a physical five-fingered hand.
This is possible due to extensive randomizations of the simulator,
large-scale distributed training infrastructure, policies with memory, and
a choice of sensing modalities which can be modelled in the simulator.
Our results demonstrate that,
contrary to a common belief,
contemporary deep RL algorithms
can be applied to solving complex real-world robotics problems which
are beyond the reach of existing non-learning-based approaches.
