\begin{abstract}
%
We investigate convergence of an iterative deliberation process for an agent community wishing to make a joint decision. 
%
We develop a general model consisting of a community of $n$ agents, each with their initial ideal point in some metric space $(X, d)$; and, in each iteration of the iterative deliberation process, each agent moves slightly closer to the current winner, according to some voting rule $\mathcal{R}$.
%
For several natural metric spaces and suitable voting rules for them, we identify conditions under which such an iterative deliberation is guaranteed to converge.
