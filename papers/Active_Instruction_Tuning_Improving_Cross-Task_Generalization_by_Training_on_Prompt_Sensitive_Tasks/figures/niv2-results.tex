    Experiment results for NIV2 dataset. We compare \textit{Ours} prompt uncertainty method with other baselines and report the Rouge-L scores on testing and validation set at each active instruction tuning iteration $[136, 204, 272, 340]$. \textbf{We report the average and standard deviation scores of five runs}, each with a different initial 68 tasks, 68 validation tasks, and 620 remaining task pool. Note that we do not show the standard deviation on validation since each random seed will have a different validation set, leading to high variance. Additionally, we report the \textit{Fully Trained} results which train on the entire task pool. Exact numbers for this experiment can be seen in \autoref{tab:full-results-niv2} in the Appendix.
