    \caption{\footnotesize Our proposed Active Instruction Tuning framework. Given an instruction tuning (IT) model with a sizeable existing task pool, we actively \textbf{identify and select} useful tasks from it and add them to the training task pool. After that, we train a new IT model with the updated training task pool. By continuing this loop, we expect to improve the IT model's cross-task generalization ability efficiently. The main challenge lies in \textbf{identifying useful tasks}, for which we propose to select prompt-sensitive tasks.}
