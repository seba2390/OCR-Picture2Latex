\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we investigated TT decomposition from the statistical
and computational viewpoints. To analyze its statistical performance,
we formulated the convex tensor completion problem via the low-rank TT
decomposition using the TT Schatten norm. In addition, because the
optimization of the convex problem is infeasible, we developed an
alternative algorithm called TT-RALS by combining with the ideas of
random projection and alternating minimization. Based on this, we
derived the error bounds of estimation for both the convex minimizer
and the solution obtained by TT-RALS. The experiments supported our
theoretical results and demonstrated the scalability of TT-RALS.
