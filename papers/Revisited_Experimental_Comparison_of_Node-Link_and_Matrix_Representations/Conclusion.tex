\section{Conclusions}

We presented the results of a crowdsourced evaluation of NL and AM network visualizations. Our study involved 557 online participants who used interactive versions of the two encodings, to answer $14$ varied types of questions about a large network of $256$ nodes and $1090$ edges. We found that NL is better than AM for questions about network topology and connectivity, and comparable for group and memorability tasks, and therefore a better choice
%We conclude that NL is a better choice 
for visualizing datasets similar to the one we evaluated, provided a similar interaction set.
%is needed and implemented.
