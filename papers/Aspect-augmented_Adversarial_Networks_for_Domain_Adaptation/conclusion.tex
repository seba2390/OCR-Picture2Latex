\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we propose a novel aspect-augmented adversarial network for cross-aspect and cross-domain adaptation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully learns invariant representation from aspect-relevant fragments, yielding significant improvement over the mSDA baseline and our model variants.
The effectiveness of our approach suggests the potential application of adversarial networks to a broader range of NLP tasks for improved representation learning, such as machine translation and language generation.
%We also introduce the use of reconstruction loss to stabilize adversarial training, as reflected in improved adaptation performance.
