Most every practical digital modulation uses a finite symbol alphabet instead of a continuous transmit distribution.
In our formalism this means that $i$ is chosen from an alphabet $i \in \SymbolAlphabet$, $\SymbolAlphabet = \{ s_1 , \ldots , s_M \} \subset \Disk$,
associated with $z \in \SymbolAlphabetZL$ from a load impedance alphabet $\SymbolAlphabetZL = \ChannelFunc^{-1}(\SymbolAlphabet) = \{ z_1 , \ldots , z_M \} \subset \HalfPlane$.
This caps the achievable rate at $\log_2(M)$ bpcu.
The Euclidean symbol distance $|s_m - s_n| \leq 2\DiskRadius$ is capped by the disk diameter.
This maximum is attained by a binary alphabet 
$\SymbolAlphabet = \{ 0, 2\DiskRadius \}$,
$\SymbolAlphabetZL = \{ \infty , 0\}$
but also by
$\SymbolAlphabet = \{ \DiskRadius(1+j) , \DiskRadius(1-j) \}$,
$\SymbolAlphabetZL = \{ -j , +j \}$
or any rotation of such $\SymbolAlphabet$ about $\DiskRadius$.

$M$-ary phase shift keying ($M$-PSK) is a more capable alphabet. It uses $M = 2^\ell$ symbols %($\ell \in \bbN$)
at $s_m = \DiskRadius(1+\exp(j2\pi\f{m - 1/2}{M}))$.
As mentioned earlier, this modulation is realized with a purely reactive load circuit.
\Cref{fig:Constellation_rate} shows the achievable rate of various PSK schemes. %with soft decoding (i.e. based on the unquantized observation $y$). 
The underlying numerical rate computation is described in \Cref{apdx:ar}.
At low SNR, $M$-PSK with $M \geq 4$ yields data rates very close to channel capacity while uniform-PSK ($M = \infty$) even achieves capacity.

The high-SNR gap between PSK and channel capacity confirms that purposefully adding load resistance is crucial for achieving very high data rates. We are interested in a rich symbol alphabet that remedies this gap. Inspired by \Cref{fig:CapAchievingDistr}, the capacity-achieving distribution at $\SNR = 21\dB$, we propose the symbol alphabet in \Cref{fig:Constellation_i}. It uses $M = 2^8 = 256$ and a heuristic construction that ensures large pairwise symbol distances. The symbol probabilities are set such that the outer circle is chosen with $\CircProb_1 = 0.36$ (the high-SNR value from \Cref{fig:PMF_evolution}). The associated rate graph (green dashed) in \Cref{fig:Constellation_rate} indeed demonstrates high-SNR rates very close to channel capacity. The low-SNR gap could be closed by adapting the symbol probabilities $q_m$ to the SNR (like in adaptive modulation), which is omitted for brevity.

The constellation plot \Cref{fig:Constellation_i} highlights certain symbols that are unrealizable when the load is subject to certain value-range constraints. This particular evaluation assumes an inductive RFID tag whose coil antenna ($Z\Tx = R\Tx + j\omega L\Tx$) is loaded with an impedance $R+\f{1}{j\omega C}$ with adaptive $R,C \in \bbR_+$, from the value range
$(1-\Delta)C_\text{res} \leq C \leq (1+\Delta)C_\text{res}$
about the resonance value
$C_\text{res} = 1/(\omega^2 L\Tx)$.
It can be shown that this is equivalently described by our \Cref{sec:model} model with
$z = r + jx$
and
$x = x\Tx (1 - \f{C_\text{res}}{C})$
subject to
$\f{-\Delta}{1-\Delta} x\Tx \leq x \leq \f{\Delta}{1+\Delta} x\Tx$. Thereby $x\Tx = X\Tx / R\Tx = \omega L\Tx / R\Tx$ is the coil Q-factor.
In \Cref{fig:Constellation_i} we assume $\Delta = 0.5$ and $x\Tx = 15$, which yields 9 out of 256 unrealizable symbols. The resultant loss of achievable rate turns out to be negligible at the considered SNR range (the graph is not shown in \Cref{fig:Constellation_rate} because visually it coincides with the dashed green graph). We conclude that mild value-range constraints do not prohibit near-capacity data rates.
