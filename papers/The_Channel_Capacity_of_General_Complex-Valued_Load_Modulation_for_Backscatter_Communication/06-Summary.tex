For the first time this paper stated the channel capacity of load modulation with a freely adaptable passive impedance. The obtained insights on the capacity-achieving transmit distribution and how to approximate it with finite symbol alphabets have important implications for practical high-data-rate backscatter communication systems. This applies even to the ambient backscatter case, under certain identified conditions.
