This paper investigates the satisfiability problem for Separation
Logic, with unrestricted nesting of separating conjunctions and
implications, for prenex formulae with quantifier prefix in the
language $\exists^*\forall^*$, in the cases where the universe of
possible locations is either countably infinite or finite. In analogy with
first-order logic with uninterpreted predicates and equality, we call
this fragment Bernays-Sch\"onfinkel-Ramsey Separation Logic
[$\bsr(\seplogk{k})$]. We %found
show  that, unlike in first-order logic, the
(in)finite satisfiability problem is undecidable for
$\bsr(\seplogk{k})$ and we define two non-trivial subsets thereof,
that are decidable for finite and infinite satisfiability,
respectively, by controlling the occurrences of universally quantified
variables within the scope of separating implications, as well as the
polarity of the occurrences of the latter. The decidability results
are obtained by a controlled elimination of separating connectives,
described as \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item an effective translation of a prenex form Separation Logic
  formula into a combination of a small number of \emph{test
    formulae}, using only first-order connectives, followed by
%
\item a translation of the latter into an equisatisfiable first-order
  formula.
\end{inparaenum}
