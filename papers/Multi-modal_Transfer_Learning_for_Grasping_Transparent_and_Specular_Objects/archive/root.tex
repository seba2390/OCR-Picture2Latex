\title{Transfer Learning for Multi-modal Perception on Grasping Transparent and Specular Objects}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

% NOTE: authors will be visible only in the camera-ready (ie, when using the option 'final'). 
% 	For the initial submission the authors will be anonymized.

\begin{abstract}
State-of-the-art object grasping methods rely on depth sensing to plan robust grasps, but commercially available depth sensors fail to detect transparent and specular objects.
To reach comparable grasping performance on such objects, we introduce a method for learning a multimodal perception model by bootstrapping from an existing uni-modal model. 
This transfer learning approach requires only paired multi-modal data for training, and requires no ground-truth labels nor real grasp attempts.
Our experiments show that our method outperforms depth-based models on transparent, specular, and opaque objects.

% \section{Citations}
% \label{sec:citations}

% 	Citations can be made using either \textbackslash citep\{\} or \textbackslash citet\{\}, depending from the appropriateness. To avoid the citation moving to the next line, it is often a good practice to replace the space before with a tilde (\~{}) character.
% 	Example 1: ``CoRL is the best conference ever, as discussed in~\citep{Calandra2016}.``
% 	Example 2: ``\citet{Calandra2016} proved, both theoretically and numerically, that CoRL is the best conference ever.``
	
% The maximum paper length is 8 pages excluding references and acknowledgements, and 10 pages including references and acknowledgements

\clearpage
% The acknowledgments are automatically included only in the final version of the paper.
% \acknowledgments{If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version will (and probably should) include acknowledgments. All acknowledgments go at the end of the paper, including thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial support.}
