\section{Ethical Implication}
Our proposed work addresses directly a major ethical issue in our society, namely media bias. We propose a new task for computational \textit{mitigation} of media bias. We believe in the potential beneficial impact of our work as, if published, it will lead to more research in mitigating media bias.

\section{Human Evaluation Detail}
\subsection{Human Evaluation Interface and Task}
The human evaluation was to check alignment of our metric and actual generated articles. Before annotators are given the set of articles, they need to read instruction to have basic understanding of media bias. Please refer to Figure \ref{fig:annotation_inst}.

Annotators are asked to choose between given articles that are anonymously names as ``Article 1'' and ``Article 2''. The questions that annotators were asked to answer are following:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Which article is more \textit{biased}?
   \item Which article is more \textit{neutral}?
   \item Which article contains \textit{more} information that overlapping with the given neutral article?
   \item Which article contains \textit{less} information that overlapping with the given neutral article?
   \item Check if you are a citizen of U.S.
 \end{enumerate}


\subsection{Human Evaluation Quality Control}
To ensure the quality of human evaluation, we only selected the qualified annotators who are experienced, possessing higher accuracy rate in the annotation platform (Appen.com).

We also added a separate set of qualification tasks so we could ensure the human annotator understand the task. We designed the quiz set by taking human-written neutral summary from Allsides.com to be a neutral article. Then, we prepared two manually selected articles (i) Neutral-Modified article, which is expected to be more neutral (ii) Biased article, which is expected to be selected as more biased.
For Neutral-Modified article, we changed the sequence of sentence, but keeping the information and style of writing unchanged. For the biased sample, we took opinion pieces\footnote{\textit{Opinion piece} is an article, usually published in a newspaper, that mainly reflects the author's opinion about a subject.} written about the event. An example qualification quiz set is available in Table \ref{table:quality_control}.

In a federal lawsuit filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, attorneys general from Nebraska and Oklahoma accuse the state of acting illegally by allowing marijuana sales within its borders under its so-called Amendment 64, a measure voters overwhelmingly approved in 2012 that legalizes the possession and consumption of cannabis for adults.

The two states, which voted overwhelmingly in 2012 to legalize the drug for adults over 21, say the measure violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the federal government from interfering with state marijuana laws.

% Neutral Article \\
% President Joe Biden said Monday he might raise the 100-day goal of administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccination shots to 150 million. As of Jan. 25, at least 18.5 million people have received one or both doses of the vaccine in the U.S., according to data from the Washington Post. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated more than 40 million vaccines have been distributed, while approximately 22 million have been administered. The CDC also estimated that more than 10 million doses were administered in the first month of the program, but that pace is accelerating in the second month. Biden told reporters that it would take about three weeks to reach the goal of delivering 1 million or more shots per day. Some pointed out that Biden's vaccination goal relies on a daily average of vaccinating 1 million people, a rate that was reached under former President Donald Trump when 1.3 million shots were administered on Jan. 11.

% Joe Biden on Monday appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting that the nation could soon be vaccinating 1.5 million Americans on average per day. Biden signaled his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers. It was among a flurry of moves by Biden during his first full week to show he’s taking swift action to heal an ailing economy as talks with Congress over a \$1.9tn stimulus package
