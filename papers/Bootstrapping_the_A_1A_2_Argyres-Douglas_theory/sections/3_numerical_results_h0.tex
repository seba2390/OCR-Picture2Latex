In this section we attempt to zoom in on the $(A_1,A_2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory reviewed in the previous section, following up on the numerical analysis of the Coulomb branch presented in \cite{Beem:2014zpa,Lemos:2015awa}, where the landscape of theories with one or two Coulomb branch chiral ring operators was explored. 

An interesting question that was left open in \cite{Lemos:2015awa} was whether the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory saturates the numerical lower bounds on the central charge $c$.
While it has been established analytically that this theory has the lowest possible central charge among interacting $\NN=2$ SCFTs \cite{Liendo:2015ofa}, 
this does not preclude solutions to the crossing equations \eqref{eq:crossingeqs} for $r_0=\frac65$ and values of $c$ smaller than $\frac{11}{30}$. 
The central charge bounds from \cite{Beem:2014zpa,Lemos:2015awa} were obtained for $\Lambda \leqslant 22$, and there was no particularly clear trend that would allow for an extrapolation to $\Lambda \to \infty$.


In this work we present improved numerical results, with extrapolations consistent with, but not definite proof of, the saturation of the $c$-bound by the $(A_1,A_2)$ SCFT.
Moreover, our results seem to imply that, even if there is more than one crossing symmetric four-point function for $r_0=\frac65$ and $c=\tfrac{11}{30}$, these solutions do not differ by much as far as some observables are concerned, and can be used as an approximation to the low-lying spectrum of the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory.
In particular, we are able to obtain the first
predictions for unprotected OPE coefficients in the form of \emph{true} upper and lower bounds for OPE coefficients, together with conservative extrapolations for $\Lambda \to \infty$. In addition, we also estimate the value of the lowest-twist unprotected long multiplets appearing in the non-chiral OPE. In this section we focus on the lowest spin operators, but numerical results for larger spins are presented in section \ref{sec:anlytical}, where we compare them to  estimates arising from the Lorentzian inversion formula of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep} adapted to the supersymmetric case.
