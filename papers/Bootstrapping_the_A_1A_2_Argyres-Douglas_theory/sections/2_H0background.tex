\section{The \texorpdfstring{$(A_1,A_2)$}{(A1,A2)} Argyres-Douglas theory}
\label{sec:h0background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Argyres-Douglas theories \cite{Argyres:1995jj,Argyres:1995xn} were first obtained by going to a special point on the Coulomb branch of an $\NN=2$ theory in which several BPS particles, with mutually non-local charges, become massless simultaneously. 
Among the various Argyres-Douglas models a particular class appears to be the ``simplest'', that is, the $(A_1,A_{2n})$ theories obtained in \cite{Eguchi:1996vu}. 
They are rank $n$ theories, 
\ie, their Coulomb branches have complex dimension $n$, and have trivial Higgs branches \cite{Argyres:2012fu}. 
The  chiral algebras associated to the $(A_1,A_{2n})$ theories have been conjectured to be the non-unitary series of Virasoro minimal models $\MM_{2,2n+3}$ \cite{rastelli_harvard,Beem:2017ooy}, and in this sense the theories could be argued to be ``simple''. 

In this paper we focus on the $n=1$ case of the $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas family, which is of rank one and thus the simplest in this class. In fact, among all interacting rank one SCFTs obtained through the systematic classification of \cite{Argyres:2015ffa,Argyres:2015gha,Argyres:2016xua,Argyres:2016xmc,Argyres:2016yzz}, it corresponds to the theory with the smallest $a$-anomaly coefficient,\footnote{This assumes the standard lore that the Coulomb branch chiral ring is freely generated. While this is true for all known SCFTs, there is no proof of this fact in a generic SCFT. See \cite{Argyres:2017tmj} for an exploration of theories which could have relations on the Coulomb branch.} which provides a measure of degrees of freedom in CFT \cite{Komargodski:2011vj}.
This theory was originally obtained on the Coulomb branch of a pure $\SU(3)$ gauge theory, or alternatively from an $\SU(2)$ gauge theory with a single hypermultiplet \cite{Argyres:1995jj,Argyres:1995xn}.
There is no standard nomenclature for this model, and in this paper we follow the $(A_1,A_2)$ naming convention based on its BPS quiver \cite{Cecotti:2010fi}. To emphasize its original construction it was also named $AD_{N_f=0}(\SU(3))$ and $AD_{N_f=1}(\SU(2))$  in \cite{Tachikawa:2013kta}. Finally, it can also be realized in  F-theory, on a single D3-brane probing a codimension one singularity of type $H_0$ where the dilaton is constant \cite{Dasgupta:1996ij,Aharony:1998xz}. 
For this reason the theory is often referred to as the $H_0$ theory.


The $(A_1,A_2)$ theory is an intrinsically interacting isolated fixed point with no marginal coupling: it does not have a conformal manifold nor a weak-coupling expansion. Recently, there has been progress in obtaining RG flows from $\NN=1$ Lagrangian theories that end on Argyres-Douglas SCFTs in the IR \cite{Maruyoshi:2016aim,Maruyoshi:2016tqk,Agarwal:2016pjo,Agarwal:2017roi,Benvenuti:2017bpg}, and in particular the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory can be obtained starting from a deformation of $\SU(2)$  $\NN=2$ superconformal QCD. This allows for the computation of some information about the theory, such as the superconformal index. 
As quoted in \eqref{eq:acanomalies_dimension} the values of the $a$- and $c$-anomaly coefficients are known, first obtained through a holographic computation in \cite{Aharony:2016kai},
and the dimension of the single generator of the Coulomb branch chiral ring is also known, and given in~\eqref{eq:acanomalies_dimension}.
Coulomb branch chiral ring operators can be associated with the scalar primaries of $\NN=2$ chiral operators, $\EE_{r}$ multiplets in the notation of \cite{Dolan:2002zh}, and this implies this SCFT must contain an operator  with $r_0=\Delta_{\phi}=\frac65$, as well as its conjugate.


The chiral algebra of the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory is conjectured to be the $\MM_{2,5}$ minimal model \cite{rastelli_harvard,Beem:2017ooy}, also known as the Yang-Lee edge singularity.
The first indication of this conjecture comes from the central charge. The basic chiral algebra dictionary states that $4d$ and $2d$ central charges are related by $c_{2d} = -12c_{4d}$; for the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory this gives $c_{2d} = -\frac{22}{5}$, which is indeed the correct value for the Yang-Lee model. 
Thanks to the interplay between $2d$ and $4d$ descriptions one can actually prove that $c_{4d} \geqslant \frac{11}{30}$ for any interacting $\NN=2$ SCFTs \cite{Liendo:2015ofa}.\footnote{Similar bounds can be obtained for $\NN=3$ \cite{Cornagliotto:2017dup} and $\NN=4$ \cite{Beem:2013qxa,Beem:2016wfs} theories, and also for $\NN=2$ theories with flavor symmetries  \cite{Beem:2013sza,Lemos:2015orc,Beem:2017ooy}.} This bound is saturated by the  $(A_1,A_2)$ theory, which in some sense sits at the origin of the $\NN=2$ theory space, as all other interacting SCFTs must have higher values of the $c$-central charge.
Another entry of the chiral algebra dictionary states that the Schur limit of the superconformal index \cite{Kinney:2005ej,Gadde:2011uv,Rastelli:2014jja} should match the $2d$ vacuum character. For the Yang-Lee minimal model the vacuum character seems to match the expression for the Schur index proposed in \cite{Cordova:2015nma}, while the character of the non-vacuum module has been matched to the index in the presence of a surface defect \cite{Cordova:2017mhb}.
Using the Yang-Lee model we can compute three-point functions of Schur operators, \ie, the operators captured by the chiral algebra,
modulo ambiguities when lifting operators from the $2d$ chiral algebra to representations of the four-dimensional superconformal algebra. A conjectured prescription on how to lift these ambiguities for the $(A_1,A_2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory has been put forward in \cite{Song:2016yfd}. Coulomb branch chiral ring operators, however, are not captured by the chiral algebra.


The features described above suggest that the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory might be the simplest $\NN=2$ interacting SCFT. Despite this, apart from the aforementioned quantities not much is known about the CFT data of this theory.
The fact that the theory has a Coulomb branch operator of relatively low dimension, $r_0=\frac65$, and a very low $c$ central charge, makes it well suited for the bootstrap program. 
Hence, the goal of this paper is to use modern bootstrap tools in order to access \emph{non-protected} dynamical data. 
The natural first step
is to study the two operators that are guaranteed to be present:
the stress tensor, and the $\NN=2$ chiral operator that parametrizes the Coulomb branch. Since the superconformal blocks of the former remain elusive we focus on the latter.
A preliminary analysis of chiral correlators was already started in \cite{Beem:2014zpa,Lemos:2015awa}, however the main goal of those papers was the exploration of the landscape of $\NN=2$ SCFTs through their Coulomb branch data. 
In the following sections we instead focus exclusively on the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory, and attempt to ``zoom in'' on it by studying an $\NN=2$ chiral operator of fixed dimension $r_0=\frac65$.\footnote{There are other known SCFTs with a Coulomb branch chiral ring operator of dimension $r_0=\frac65$, in particular higher rank theories whose lowest dimensional Coulomb branch generator has this dimension are obtained in F-theory by probing a singularity of type $H_0$ with $N$ D3-branes \cite{Dasgupta:1996ij,Aharony:1998xz}. However, these theories have larger values of the $c$-anomaly coefficient \cite{Aharony:2016kai}, and by fixing the central charge we can focus on the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory.}
