\section{Inverting the OPEs}
\label{sec:anlytical}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In recent years, starting from \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012yx,Komargodski:2012ek}, there has been much progress in understanding the large spin spectrum of CFTs by studying analytically the crossing equations in a Lorentzian limit.
In $d >2$, by studying 
the four-point function $\langle \phi_1(x_1) \phi_1(x_2) \phi_2(x_3) \phi_2(x_4) \rangle$ in the lightcone limit, the authors of \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012yx,Komargodski:2012ek} found that in the $t-$channel there must be exchanged, in a distributional sense, double-twist operators, \ie, operators whose dimensions approach $\Delta_1 + \Delta_2 + \ell$ for $\ell \to \infty$, and whose OPE coefficients tend to the values of generalized free field theory. Corrections to these dimensions and OPE coefficients, or rather weighted averages of these quantities, in a large spin expansion can be obtained in terms of the leading twist operators exchanged in the $s-$channel.\footnote{Some of the steps taken in the derivations \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012yx,Komargodski:2012ek} rely on intuitive assumptions, some of which have started to be put on a firm footing in \cite{Qiao:2017xif}.} 
Assuming the existence of individual operators close to the average values, this procedure was set up to systematically compute the OPE coefficients and dimensions of the double-twist operators in an asymptotic expansion in the inverse spin \cite{Alday:2015ewa}.
The lightcone limit of the crossing equations has been used to constrain the large spin spectrum of various CFTs with different global symmetries and supersymmetries \cite{Fitzpatrick:2012yx,Komargodski:2012ek,Alday:2013cwa,Fitzpatrick:2014vua,Vos:2014pqa,Fitzpatrick:2015qma,Kaviraj:2015cxa,Alday:2015eya,Kaviraj:2015xsa,Alday:2015ota,Beem:2015aoa,1612.03891,1603.05150,1611.01500,1612.00696,1510.08091,1602.04928,1511.08025}.
Remarkably, this has resulted in predictions for OPE coefficients and anomalous dimensions of operators that match the numerical results down to spin two \cite{Simmons-Duffin:2016wlq, Alday:2015ota}.

Recently, the work of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep} has explained this agreement, by showing that the spectrum organizes in analytic families.\footnote{We thank Marco Meineri for many discussions on \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}.} There, a ``Lorentzian'' inversion formula for the $s-$channel OPE of a given correlator was obtained, with the crucial feature that the result of the inversion is a function that is analytic in spin (a function valid only for spin greater than one). 
This established, for sufficiently large spin, the existence of each individual double-twist operator.
The inversion formula explained the organization of the spectrum, and allows one to compute individual OPE coefficients and anomalous dimensions, avoiding the asymptotic expansions, and obtaining the coefficients instead of averages.


\medskip


Motivated by the success of \cite{Simmons-Duffin:2016wlq}, we take the first steps towards a systematic analysis of the $(A_1,A_2)$ theory for large spin, considering both crossing equations \eqref{eq:crossingeqs}.
We apply the inversion formula obtained in \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}  to invert the chiral \eqref{eq:chiral} and non-chiral \eqref{eq:nonchiral} OPEs. The block decomposition of the former happens to be simply a decomposition in bosonic blocks \eqref{eq:chiralblocks}, and thus the inversion formula directly applies. The latter has a decomposition in superblocks, but as we shall see, the formula can still be applied, although we must work as if we had a correlator of unequal external operators. The only required modifications will be on the spin down to which the formula holds, and on what the crossed-channel decompositions are.
Since the numerical results in supersymmetric theories are not yet at the level of accuracy of the $3d$ Ising model, we refrain from using numerical data as input to the analysis, and instead compare the large-spin estimates coming from the inversion formula with the numerical results. The only input we give is the exchange of the identity and stress-tensor supermultiplet in the non-chiral OPE, and thus find results that are good estimates for sufficiently large spin. We find a reasonable agreement between the OPE coefficients of the leading-twist short operators exchanged in the chiral channel, and the analytical estimate, already for low spin, see figure \ref{Fig:ClCH}. Our analysis also shows that the anomalous dimensions of the double-twist operators in the non-chiral channel, arising from the stress tensor exchange, are small, and we confirm this by matching to numerical estimates of these dimensions obtained from the bounds of section \ref{sec:numericsh0} (see figure \ref{Fig:anomCH}).



We start with a brief summary of the results of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep} relevant for our purposes and refer the reader to that reference for further details. 
Starting from  the four-point function of unequal scalar operators,
\be 
\langle \OO_1(x_1)\OO_2(x_2)\OO_3(x_3)\OO_4(x_4) \rangle =\frac{1}{|x_{12}|^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2}|x_{34}|^{\Delta_3+\Delta_4}} \left|\frac{x_{14}}{x_{24}}\right|^{\Delta_{21}}  \left|\frac{x_{14}}{x_{13}}\right|^{\Delta_{34}} \GG(z, \zb)\,,
\label{eq:CHfourpoint}
\ee
the main result is a ``Lorentzian'' inversion formula for the $s-$channel decomposition of $\GG(z,\zb)$ in conformal blocks,
\be 
\GG(z, \zb) = \sum\limits_{\Delta,\ell} \lambda_{\Delta,\ell}^2 g^{\Delta_{12},\Delta_{34}}_{\Delta,\ell}(z, \zb)\,.
\label{eq:Gdecbos}
\ee
The OPE coefficients $\lambda_{\Delta,\ell}^2$ (for $\ell >1$) of the above decomposition \eqref{eq:Gdecbos} are then encoded in the residues of a function $c(\ell,\Delta)$  that is analytic in spin, contrasting with the one that can be obtained from a Euclidean inversion of the OPE. The condition $\ell >1$ arises during the contour manipulations needed to go from the  Euclidean inversion of the OPE, valid only for integer $\ell$, to the ``Lorentzian'' formula of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}. This condition requires looking at the $t-$ and $u-$ channels to bound the growth of $\GG(z,\zb)$  in a particular region, and it is valid for any unitary CFT.
The function $c(\ell, \Delta) $ receives contributions from the $t-$ and  $u-$channels, with the even and odd spin operators defining two independent trajectories, as 
\be 
c(\ell, \Delta) = c^t (\ell, \Delta) + (-1)^\ell c^u(\ell, \Delta)\,,
\label{eq:ctandcu}
\ee
where $c^t$ and $c^u$ are defined in (3.20) of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}.

The poles of $c(\ell, \Delta)$ in $\Delta$, at fixed $\ell$, encode the dimensions of the operators in the theory, with the residues giving the  OPE coefficients.\footnote{In some cases the residues need to be corrected as discussed in (3.9) of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}, but for the computations carried out in this section this correction is not needed.} As described in section 3.2 of \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}, if one is interested only in getting the poles and residues, the inversion formula can be written as
\be
\begin{split}
c^t(\ell,\Delta)\big\vert_{\mathrm{poles}} &= \int\limits_0^1 \frac{\d z}{2z} z^{\frac{\ell-\Delta}{2}} \left( \sum\limits_{m=0}^{\infty} z^m \sum\limits_{k=-m}^{m} B_{\ell,\Delta}^{(m,k)} C^t(z, \ell+\Delta+2k)\right)\,, \\
C^t(z, \beta)&= \int\limits_z^1 \d \zb \frac{(1-\zb)^{\frac{\Delta_{21}+\Delta_{34}}{2}}}{\zb^2} \kappa_{\beta} k_\beta^{\Delta_{12}, \Delta_{34}}(\zb) \dDisc\left[\GG(z,\zb)\right]\,,
\end{split}
\label{eq:CHgeneratingbos}
\ee
and similarly for $c^u(\ell,\Delta)$.
Here  $\dDisc$ denotes the double-discontinuity of the function, 
$k_\beta^{\Delta_{12}, \Delta_{34}}(\zb)$ is defined in equation \eqref{eq:bosblock}, and 
\be 
\kappa_{\beta}= \frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{\beta -\Delta_{21}}{2}\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{\Delta_{21}+\beta }{2}\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{\beta-\Delta_{34} }{2}\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{\Delta_{34} + \beta }{2}\right)}{2 \pi ^2 \Gamma (\beta -1) \Gamma (\beta )} \,.
\ee
The $z \to 0$ limit of the block in \eqref{eq:CHgeneratingbos} gave the collinear block $k_\beta^{\Delta_{12}, \Delta_{34}}(\zb)$ which does not take into account all descendants, these are instead taken into account by the functions $B_{\ell,\Delta}^{(m,k)}$, as discussed in \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep}. Since we shall focus only on leading twist operators we do not need to subtract descendants and thus do not need these functions, apart from $B_{\ell,\Delta}^{(0,0)}=1$.
A term $z^{\frac{\tau(\Delta+\ell)}{2}}$ in the bracketed term in \eqref{eq:CHgeneratingbos}  implies there exists a pole at $\Delta-\ell = \tau(\Delta+\ell)$, with its residue, taken at fixed $\ell$, providing the OPE coefficient;  see \cite{Caron-Huot:2017vep} for more details.
