\section{Implementation}



According to the design in Section~\ref{sec:approach}, we have implemented a prototype for \nickName{}.
We build a static analysis tool based on Soot~\cite{soot} to generate call graphs and perform bytecode rewriting for Android apps.  
Our static analysis tool also inspects the code to find the identifiers that reference resources (e.g., in the format of \textit{R.type.name}) and computes the relationships between the code and the resources.
To analyze resource files, we build another tool based on Apktool~\cite{apktool} to decode resources from APK files and analyze the dependencies among resources. 
 
Our iterative and back-complementary recovery tool is implemented upon the \textit{Android Debug Bridge (ADB)} tool and the \textit{MonkeyRunner}~\cite{monkeyrunner}.
The tool leverages the ADB tool to search apps' logs for entries that contain \textit{ClassNotFoundException}, so that \nickName can detect the missing code. 

Our record and replay tool is implemented based on the MonkeyRunner, and developers can record a sequence of actions to launch the target activity. 
We implement the \nickName{} client to enable virtualization space based on VirtualApp~\cite{virtualapp}, which is an open-source Android container.
