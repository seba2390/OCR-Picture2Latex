\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we have proposed a service-oriented approach called \nickName{} to decompose Android Apps with app-level virtualization. \nickName{} allows developers to decompose an app into multiple bundles, and visit activities on demand. \nickName{} does not require any platform-level changes, and can run decomposed apps without installation. Our evaluations show that \nickName{} can save the initial download size of an app, and achieve better runtime performance than the native Android system when running the same app due to the reduced app size.
