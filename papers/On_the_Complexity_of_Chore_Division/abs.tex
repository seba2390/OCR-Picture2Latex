We study the proportional chore division problem where a protocol wants to divide an undesirable object, called chore, among $n$ different players. The goal is to find an allocation such that the cost of the chore assigned to each player be at most $1/n$ of the total cost. This problem is the dual variant of the cake cutting problem in which we want to allocate a desirable object. \citeboth{edmonds2006cake} showed that any protocol for the proportional cake cutting must use at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ queries in the worst case, however, finding a lower bound for the proportional chore division remained an interesting open problem. We show that chore division and cake cutting problems are closely related to each other and provide an $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bound for chore division.
% We also consider the problem when players have unequal entitlements and show that any protocol for chore division and cake cutting must use an unbounded number of queries. Finally, we present a simple algorithm that allocates a chore among the players with unequal entitlements using an unbounded but finite number of queries.
