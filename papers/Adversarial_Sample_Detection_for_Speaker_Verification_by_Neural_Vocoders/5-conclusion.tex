\label{sec:conclusion}
This work adopts the neural vocoder to detect adversarial samples for ASV.
The proposed method accomplishes effective detection performance and outperforms the Griffin-Lim baseline in all the settings.
The key properties of the vocoder, including less distortion in genuine samples and better purification ability for adversarial samples, are both important for detection.
% We believe the proposed detection framework can generalize to other nearly lossless transform, not just neural vocoders.
We will compare the performance of detecting adversarial samples with other attacking methods for ASV in our future work.
Also, we will evaluate the detection performance when the detection method is known to the attackers.
% We will also refer to \cite{yang2020characterizing}, and characterize the adversarial robustness of our method under powerful adaptive attacks in the future work.
