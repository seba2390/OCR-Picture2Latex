\section{Introduction}
There are several problems in extremal combinatorics on distances in codes. For instance, the famous paper \cite{D} derives an upper bound on the size of a code $C$ over $\F_q$ with exactly $s$ distinct distances:
\begin{equation}
|C|\le \sum_{j=0}^s {n \choose j} (q-1)^j.
\end{equation}
In the same spirit, other authors have given upper bounds on the size of codes with one or several forbidden distances \cite{EFIN}.

 In this note, we tackle a related but distinctly different problem:
how many distinct weights can a linear code of given dimension over a given finite field have ? In other words, we study the combinatorial function $L(k,q),$ the maximum number
of nonzero weights a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ may have. While an upper bound is easy to prove (Proposition \ref{prop1}),
its tightness is nontrivial\footnote{ After submission of this article, a proof was found in \cite{proof}.} and we only manage to establish it in some special cases like $k=2$ or $q=2$
(Cf. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2). Numerical experiments with very long random codes suggest it is tight for all $k$'s and $q$'s. We leave the question as an open problem.
We can also study the more refined function $L(n,k,q),$ the maximum number of nonzero weights an $[n,k]_q$ code may have. This latter function is related to both $L(k,q)$ and
equation $(1)$ above.
The nonlinear counterpart of $L(k,q)$ denoted by  $N(M,q),$ can be determined explicitly (Theorem \ref{tight2}). The nonlinear counterpart of $L(n,k,q)$ denoted by  $N(n,M,q),$
can also be studied. The rate of convergence of $N(n,M,q)$ towards $N(M,q)$ requires perfect difference sets \cite{BJL} and primes in short intervals \cite{BHP} for its careful study.

The material is organized as follows. Section 2 collects the necessary notations and definitions. Section 3 studies upper bounds in the linear code case.
Section 4 derives lower bounds in that situation. Section 5 introduces and investigates the function $L(n,k,q).$
Section 6 tackles the nonlinear analogues of $L(k,q)$ and $L(n,k,q),$ denoted by $N(M,q),$ and $N(n,M,q),$ respectively. Section 7 concludes the article.
An appendix collects some numerical values, which comfort the Conjecture that Proposition \ref{prop1} is tight.
\section{Definitions and notation}
Let $q$ be a prime power, and $\F_q$ denote the finite field of order $q.$
By a {\bf code} of length $n$ over $\F_q,$ we shall mean a proper subset of $\F_q^n.$ This code is {\bf linear} if it is a  $\F_q$-vector subspace of $\F_q^n.$
 The {\bf dimension} of a code, denoted by $k$, is equal to its dimension as a vector space. The parameters of such a code are written compactly as $[n,k]_q.$
The {\bf Hamming weight}  of $x\in \F_q^n,$ denoted by $w(x),$ is the number of indices $i$ where $x_i \neq 0.$
The {\bf Hamming distance}  between $x\in \F_q^n,$ and $y \in \F_q^n,$ denoted by $d(x,y),$ is defined by $d(x,y)=w(x-y).$
For a given prime power $q$ and given values of $k$, let {\bf $L(k,q)$} denote the largest possible number of nonzero weights a $q$-ary code can have.
If $C(n)$ is a family of codes of parameters $[n, k_n]_q$, the {\bf rate} $R$ is defined as $$R=\limsup\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{k_n}{n}.$$
Recall that the $q$-ary {\bf entropy function} $H_q(.)$ is defined for $0<y< 1,$ by $$ H_q(y)=y\log_q(q-1)-y\log_q(y)-(1-y)\log_q(1-y).$$
\section{Upper bounds}
The following monotonicity properties of $L(k,q)$ are given without proof.
{\prop For all nonegative integers $k,m$ and all prime powers $q$ we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
L(k,q)&\le & L(k+1,q),\\
L(k,q)&\le & L(k,q^m).
\end{eqnarray*}
}
The next result is trivial but crucial.
{\prop \label{prop1} For all prime powers $q,$ and all integers $k\ge 1,$ we have
$$L(k,q)\le \frac{q^k-1}{q-1}.$$
}\vspace{-0.8cm}
\begin{proof}
The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
\end{proof}

This bound is met with equality if $q=2.$
{\theorem \label{tight} For all integers $k\ge 1,$ we have
$$L(k,2)= {2^k-1}.$$}\vspace{-1.0cm}
\begin{proof}
Denote by $G_k$ the generator matrix of an $[n,k]_q$ with $L(k,2)$ weights $w_1<w_2<\dots<w_{L(k,2)}.$
Define $H_{k+1}$ a matrix obtained from $G_k$ by adding a $k$ by $t$ block of zeros, and by  $G_{k+1}$ the matrix obtained by $H_{k+1}$ by adding an
a row with first $n$ coordinates zero and last $t$ coordinates $=1.$
The code spanned by the rows of $G_{k+1}$ has all these weights plus the $ L(k,2)+1$ new weights $t<t+w_1<\cdots<t+w_{L(k,2)}.$ The two sets of weights will have void intersection if
$w_{L(k,2)}<t.$  This makes $2L(k,2)+1$ weights altogether. Note that the rank of $G_{k+1}$ is $k+1.$
Thus we have proved that  $L(k+1,2)\ge 2L(k,2)+1,$ which implies by induction, starting from $L(1,2)=1,$ the lower bound $L(k,2)\ge{2^k-1}.$ The result follows.\end{proof}
%The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
{\bf Remark:} We are now ready to given an alternative proof of Theorem 1. we can exhibit a linear code $C$ with dimension $k$ over $\F_2$ with $2^k-1$ nonzero weights. Let the generator matrix of $C$ be

where $a_1=1,$ $a_2=2$, $a_3=2^2$, $a_4=2^3$, $\ldots$, $a_k=2^{k-1}.$
Since $a_{j_1}+a_{j_2}+\ldots+a_{j_t}= \underbrace{{(\ldots010\ldots010\ldots010\ldots)}_2}_k$ in base $2,$ and the coordinates of $1'$s are $j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_t$, respectively,
it can be seen that the Hamming weight of $uG$ is equal to the integer whose expansion in base $2$ is $u.$
Thus, we obtain all integers of $k$ bits as possible weights that is the set
$\{1,2,3,\dots,2^k-1\}$
of cardinality $2^k-1$ in all.


The bound in proposition \ref{prop1} is also tight when $k=2.$
{\theorem For all prime powers $q,$  we have
$L(2,q)= q+1.$
}
\begin{proof}
Let $\{u,v\}$ be a basis of a code $C$ candidate to have $q+1$ weights. Denote by $S,\,T$ the supports of $u,v$ respectively. Let $|S\setminus T|=a,$ $|T\setminus S|=b.$
On the intersection $S\bigcap T$ assume $v$ is the all-one vector. Denote by $\omega$ a primitive root of $\F_q.$ Assume $|S\bigcap T|={q \choose 2}$ and that $u$ restricted to $S\bigcap T$ is
$$(1,\omega, \omega, \omega^2,\omega^2,\omega^2,\dots,\omega^{q-2},\dots,\omega^{q-2}) $$
where $\omega^i$ occurs $i+1$ times. With these conventions, we see that the weights of $C$ are
\begin{itemize}
\item $w(u)=a+{q \choose 2},$
\item $w(v)=b+{q \choose 2},$
\item $w(u-xv)=a+b+ {q \choose 2}-i$ if $x=\omega^{i-1}$ for $i=1,2,\dots,q-1.$
\end{itemize}
Assume $a<b.$ The above weights will be pairwise different if $a+b+{q \choose 2}-(q-1)>b+{q \choose 2},$ that is if $a\ge q.$
Thus, under these conditions, $C$ counts $2+q-1=q+1$ nonzero weights.
%The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
\end{proof}

{\bf Remark:} The shortest $[n,2]_q$ code with $L(2,q)$ nonzero weights obtained by this construction has $n={q \choose 2}+2q+1.$

\section{Lower bounds}
The easiest lower bound is

{\prop For all prime powers $q,$ and all integers $k\ge 1,$ we have
$L(k,q)\ge k.$
}
\begin{proof}
Consider the code $\F_q^k,$ of length and dimension $k.$
\end{proof}

This can be improved to a bound that is exponential in $k.$
{\prop \label{expo} For all prime powers $q,$ and all integers $k\ge 1,$ we have
$$L(k+1,q)\ge 2L(k,q)+1.$$ In particular, for all integers $k\ge 2,$ we have $$L(k,q)\ge 2^{k-2}q+2^{k-2}+1.$$
} \vspace{-0.8cm}
\begin{proof}
Same argument as in the first proof of Theorem \ref{tight}. The second assertion follows by iterating this bound starting from $L(2,q)=q+1.$
\end{proof}
An asymptotic version of the preceding results is as follows. Define

$$ \lambda(q)=\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{k}\log_q(L(k,q)) .$$

{\theorem For all prime powers $q$ we have $$\log_q 2 \le \lambda(q) \le 1.$$ In particular $\lambda(2)=1.$
}
\begin{proof}
The first inequality comes from Proposition \ref{expo}. The second one comes Proposition \ref{prop1}.
\end{proof}

{\bf Remark:} Since we conjecture that the bound of Proposition \ref{prop1} is tight, it is natural to conjecture that $\lambda(q)=1$ for all prime powers $q.$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\section{Numerical lower bounds}

\section{Refinements and asymptotics}

A more complex function is $L(n,k,q)$ the largest number of nonzero weights an $[n,k]_q$-code can have. This function is related to $L(k,q)$ in several ways.
The following monotonicity properties of $L(n,k,q)$ are given without proof.
{\prop For all nonegative integers $k,m$ and all prime powers $q$ we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
L(n,k,q)&\le & L(n,k+1,q),\\
L(n,k,q)&\le & L(n,k,q^m).
\end{eqnarray*}
}
The three following lemmas are useful for the proof of Theorem \ref{thm4}.
{\lemma \label{1} For all prime powers $q,$ and all nonnegative integers $n,k$ we have
$L(n,k, q)\le L(k,q).$
}
\begin{proof}
Immediate from the definitions.
\end{proof}

The new function is also monotone in $n.$
{\lemma \label{2} For all prime powers $q,$ and all nonnegative integers $n,k$ we have
$L(n,k, q)\le L(n+1, k,q).$
}
\begin{proof}
If $C$ is an $[n,k]_q$ code with $L(n,k, q)$ nonzero weights, then $C$ extended by a constant zero coordinate is an $[n+1,k]_q$-code with the same number of nonzero weights.
\end{proof}

{\lemma \label{3} For all prime powers $q,$ and all nonnegative integers $n,k$ we have
$L(n,k, q)\le n.$
}
\begin{proof}
Note that, by definition of the Hamming weight, a code of length $n$ can have at most $n$ distinct weights.
\end{proof}

We now connect the new function $L(n,k,q)$ with $L(k,q).$

{\theorem \label{thm4} For all prime powers $q,$ and all nonnegative integers $k$ we have
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty }L(n,k,q)=L(k,q).$$
More precisely, there is an integer $n_0\ge L(k,q),$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$ we have $L(n,k,q)=L(k,q).$
}

\begin{proof}
By Lemmas \ref{1} and \ref{2}, the sequence $n \mapsto L(n,k,q)$ is increasing and bounded. Hence, being integral, it converges stably to a limit which can be no other than $L(k,q).$
Let $n_0$ be such that $L(n_0,k,q)=L(k,q).$ By Lemma \ref{3}, we see that $n_0\ge L(k,q).$
\end{proof}
{\bf Remark:} The computations of the Appendix suggest that such an $n_0$ can be very large. If Proposition 2 is tight then, by Theorem \ref{thm4} $n_0 \ge \frac{q^k-1}{q-1}.$
In the special case $q=2,$ the second proof of Theorem 1 shows that $n_0=2^k-1.$\\


There is a link to Delsarte's bound (equation (1)) quoted in the Introduction.
{\prop \label{HW} For all prime powers $q,$ and all integers $n\ge k\ge 1,$ we have
$$q^k \le \sum_{i=0}^{L(n,k,q)}{n \choose i}(q-1)^i.$$
Further
$$L(k,q)\le \frac{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{L(n,k,q)}{n \choose i}(q-1)^i-1}{q-1}.$$}\vspace{-0.0cm}
\begin{proof}
The first assertion is a direct application of Equation (1) in Introduction (\cite[Th. 4.1]{D}) with $|C|=q^k,$ and $s=L(n,k,q).$ Combining this result with Proposition \ref{prop1} gives the second assertion.
%The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
\end{proof}
We give an asymptotic version of the preceding results. Let $${\mathcal L}(R)=\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q(L(n,\lfloor Rn \rfloor,q)).$$

{\theorem If $C_n$ is a family of codes of rate $R$ then
$${\mathcal L}(R)\le R \lambda(q) \le H_q({\mathcal L}(R)).  $$
In particular ${\mathcal L}(R)\le t(q),$ where $t(q)$ is the unique solution in the range $(0,\frac{q-1}{q})$ of $H_q(x)=x.$ See Fig. 1.
}
\begin{proof} The first inequality follows by Lemma \ref{1}, upon observing that $$ \limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{n}(L(k,q))=R\lambda(q).$$
The second inequality comes from the second assertion of Proposition \ref{HW}, after using standard entropic estimates \cite{HP}.
The second assertion is obtained by combining the first and second inequality.
%The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
\end{proof}

Define the domain $\mathcal D$ as the set of points in the plane $(R,\mathcal L)$ that are realized by a family of codes. By the preceding result, this domain is contained in the domain of
boundaries given by, counterclockwise, in Fig. 2 by
\begin{enumerate}
\item the straight line ${\mathcal L}=R$ from $R=0$ till $R=t(q),$
\item the horizontal line ${\mathcal L}=t(q)$ from $R=t(q)$ till $R=1,$
\item  the vertical line $R=1$ from ${\mathcal L}=t(q)$ till ${\mathcal L}=\frac{q-1}{q},$
\item the curve ${\mathcal L}=H_q^{-1}(R),$ from $R=1$ till $R=0.$

Determining the domain $\mathcal D$ explicitly, in the same way as the domain of packing and covering codes in \cite{CHLS} is a challenging open problem.






\section{Nonlinear codes}
{\bf Warning:} In this section only $q$ is an arbitrary integer $>1.$

The nonlinear analogue of the function $L(k,q)$ is the function $N(M,q)$ which is the largest number of distances between two codewords of an unrestricted code of size $M$ over
some finite alphabet $A_q$ of size $q.$
This function is completely determined in the following Theorem.
{\theorem \label{tight2} For all integers $M\ge 2,$ we have
$$N(M,q)={M \choose 2}.$$ }\vspace{-0.8cm}
\begin{proof}
By definition we have immediately $N(M,q)\le{M \choose 2}.$ By an inductive process, we construct a code $C_M$ with ${M \choose 2}$ distances. To simplify matters take $q=2.$
We search for codes in a special form where nonzero codewords are of the form $(1,1,\dots,1,0,\dots,0),$ that is a run of ones followed by a run of zeros. Thus the distance between two such codewords is equal to the difference of their weights. For $M=2,$ we may take the length $1$ code $\{0,1\}.$
Assume $C_M$ is constructed with codewords of successive weights $w_0=0<w_1<\cdots<w_{M-1}.$ We construct a code $C_{M+1}$ by adding a tail of zeros to $C_M$ on the right, of length to be specified later, and by adding a new codeword of weight $w_M.$ The new distances are $M$ in number, given by
$w_M, w_M-w_1,\dots,w_M-w_{M-1}.$ These distances are pairwise distinct because $(w_M-w_i)-(w_M-w_j)=w_j-w_i.$ To make sure they are distinct from the distances in $C_M,$ we must check that
$$ (w_M-w_i)\neq w_j-w_k,$$ with $i,j,k$ distinct nonegative integers $\le M-1.$ This is enforced if we take $w_M$ large enough. This condition on $w_M,$ in turn, will determine how long the tail must be.
Since ${{M+1} \choose 2}-{M \choose 2}=M,$   we are done.
\end{proof}

The nonlinear analogue of the function $L(n,k,q)$ is the function $N(n,M,q)$ which is the largest number of distances between two codewords of an unrestricted code of size $M$
and length $n$ over some alphabet $A_q,$ of size $q.$



The analogue of Theorem \ref{thm4} in this context is as follows. The proof is similar and omitted.

{\theorem For all integers $q>1,$ and all nonnegative integers $M$ we have
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty }N(n,M,q)=N(M,q).$$
More precisely, there is an integer $n_0\ge N(M,q),$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$ we have $N(n,M,q)=N(M,q).$
}\\

Denote by $N_0(M,q)$ the smallest integer $n$ such that $N(n,M,q)=N(M,q).$
{\prop If $M-1$ is a power of a prime, then $N_0(M,q)\le 2N(M,q)+1.$ }
\begin{proof}
 Assume $M=s+1,$ where $s$ is a power of a prime. We know there is a Singer difference set \cite{S} $S=\{v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{s+1}\},$ with parameters $(s^2+s+s,s+1,1).$
Consider the $s+1$ by $s^2+s+1$ matrix with rows $g_i,$ when $g_i$ contains $v_i$ consecutive ones to the left and zeros elsewhere. The Hamming distance from $g_i$ to $g_j$
is $|v_i-v_j|.$ The code formed by the $M$ rows of this matrix has length $s^2+s+1=M^2-M+1=2{M \choose 2}+1$ and $M \choose 2$ distances, by the design property. Hence, in this case,
$n_0\le 2{M \choose 2}+1.$ For instance, if $s=2,$ we have $S=\{1,2,4\},$ and the code is $\{1000000,1100000,1111000\}.$ See \cite[p.264]{BJL} for details on, and examples of
Singer difference sets.
\end{proof}
Denote, for any integer $t,$ by $pp(t)$ the smallest prime power $\ge t.$

{\cor \label{NT} For all integers $M>1,$ we have $$N_0(M,q)\le 2N(pp(M-1)+1,q)+1\le 2N(2M,q)\sim 8 {M \choose 2}.$$}\vspace{-1.0cm}
\begin{proof}
 We claim that $N_0(M,q)$ is a nondecreasing function of $M.$ The first inequality will follow by the previous theorem, since $M\le pp(M-1)+1.$ To prove the claim note that, if we have a set of $M+1$ vectors of length $N_0(M+1,q),$
 with ${M+1 \choose 2 }$ distances,
 removing any vector will result into a set of $M$ vectors with ${M+1 \choose 2 }-M={M \choose 2}$ distances. Hence $N_0(M,q)\le N_0(M+1,q).$ The second inequality follows
 by the crude bound $pp(x)\le 2x,$ valid for any positive integer $x.$
\end{proof}

{\bf Remark:} It is possible to reduce the upper bound on $pp(x)$ to $pp(x)\le x+x^a,$ with $a=0.525,$ building on recent estimates on the existence of primes in short intervals
\cite{BHP}. This sharpens the upper bound on $N_0(M,q)$ to $2N(M+O(M^a),q)+1\sim 2 {M \choose 2},$ for $M\rightarrow \infty.$

\section{Conclusion and open problems}
In this note, we have studied a  problem of extremal combinatorics: maximizing the number of distinct nonzero weights a linear code can have.
We conjecture, based on extensive numerical calculations on very long codes, that the bound of Proposition 2 is tight but cannot prove it. A proof was found later in \cite{proof}.
A recursive approach in the manner of the proof of Theorem \ref{tight2} would require to produce $q^k$ new weights to go from $L(k,q)$ to $L(k+1,q).$
But a code achieving $L(k,q)$ has only $\frac{q^k-1}{q-1}<q^k$ distinct weights. Thus establishing the tightness of Proposition 1 is the main open problem of this note.
Sharpening the upper bound on $N_0(M,q)$ of Corollary \ref{NT} is also a challenging question.
Determining explicitly the domain $\mathcal D$ of Section 5 seems to require better lower bounds on $L(n,kq)$ that those at our disposal.

{\bf Appendix: numerical examples}

We provide lower bounds on $L(k,q)$ by computing the number of weights in long random codes produced by the computer package Magma \cite{M}.

When $n$ is in the millions, we can find linear $[n,k]_q$-codes that meet the upper bound in Proposition \ref{prop1}: see Table 2.

{\proposition For all prime powers $q,$ and all integers $n\ge k\ge 1,$ we have
$$q^k \le \sum_{i=0}^{L(k,q)}{n \choose i}(q-1)^i.$$
}
\begin{proof}
This is a direct application of \cite[Th. 4.1]{D} with $|C|=q^k,$ and $s=L(k,q).$
%The total numbers of nonzero codewords of a code of dimension $k$ over $\F_q$ is $q^k-1,$ and all the nonzero multiples of a given codeword share the same weight.
\end{proof}
There is another proof if we can exhibit a linear code $C$ with dimension $k$ over $\F_2$ with $2^k-1$ nonzero weights. Let the generator matrix of $C$ be

where $a_1=1,$ $a_2=2$, $a_3=2^2$, $a_4=2^3$, $\ldots$, $a_k=2^{k-1}.$ We can get many nonzero weights when these $k$ rows are combined with each other as follows:
$$\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k,a_1+a_2,a_1+a_3,\ldots,a_{k-1}+a_k,\ldots,a_1+a_2+\ldots+a_k\}.$$
Since $a_{j_1}+a_{j_2}+\ldots+a_{j_t}= \underbrace{{(\ldots010\ldots010\ldots010\ldots)}_2}_k$ in base $2,$ and the coordinates of $1'$s are $j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_t$, respectively, these nonzero weights are different from each other.
Hence $C$ has ${k \choose 1}+{k \choose 2}+\cdots+{k \choose k}=2^k-1$ nonzero weights.
