\section{Future plans}
Among many, we are left with three questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the filtered colimit of the chain $\aMre[n]\to \aMre[n+1]$, and are these inclusions coreflective as well?
	\item Can we find a representation for \emph{all} $K_n$ in terms of postcomposition with universal 1-cells? In other words, can we find the universal $n$-soft machine, perhaps adapting \autoref{constr_pinfty}?
	\item \autoref{moorif_right} and \autoref{decap_right} characterize $K_0,K_1$ as postcomposition; but then $D_0,D_1$ are \emph{left liftings} in $\Mly$: can we deduce something meaningful from this intrinsic characterization?\footnote{Observe that the existence of right liftings \cite[2.1.3]{coend-calcu} can be ruled out by the fact that postcompositions do not preserve colimits in general.}
\end{itemize}
