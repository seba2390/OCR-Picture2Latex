	% A semigroupal category, i.e. a `monoidal category without monoidal unit' is the one-object version of a \emph{semibicategory}, a `bicategory without identity 1-cells'.
	We study the semibicategory $\Mre$ of \emph{Moore automata}: an arrangement of objects, 1- and 2-cells which is inherently and irredeemably nonunital in dimension one.

 Between the semibicategory of Moore automata and the better behaved bicategory $\Mly$ of \emph{Mealy automata} a plethora of adjunctions insist: the well-known essential equivalence between the two kinds of state machines that model the definitions of $\Mre$ and $\Mly$ is appreciated at the categorical level, as the equivalence induced between the fixpoints of an adjunction, in fact exhibiting $\Mre(A,B)$ as a coreflective subcategory of $\Mly(A,B)$; the comodality induced by this adjunction is but the $0$th step of a `level-like' filtration of the bicategory $\Mre$ in a countable family of essential bi-localizations $\aMre[n]\subseteq\Mre$. We outline a way to generate intrinsically meaningful adjunctions of this form. We mechanize some of our main results using the proof assistant \texttt{Agda}.
