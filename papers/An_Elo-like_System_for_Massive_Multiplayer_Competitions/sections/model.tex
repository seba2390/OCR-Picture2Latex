\section{A Bayesian Model for Massive Competitions}
\label{sec:bayes_model}
% The method is best-suited for competitions in which the most pertinent information is round rankings. Note that, in the programming contest setting, this means we discard specific information about player scores, which are difficult to model and depend heavily on the specifics of the problem set. This method would be ill-suited to model, for instance, track races, where a runner's absolute time is more informative than relative rankings. On the other hand, it may be very well-suited to obstacle-course races, if each round consists of novel obstacles that make the absolute times hard to interpret.

We now describe the setting formally, denoting random variables by capital letters. A series of competitive \textbf{rounds}, indexed by $t=1,2,3,\ldots$, take place sequentially in time. Each round has a set of participating \textbf{players} $\cP_t$, which may in general overlap between rounds. A player's \textbf{skill} is likely to change with time, so we represent the skill of player $i$ at time $t$ by a real random variable $S_{i,t}$.

In round $t$, each player $i\in \cP_t$ competes at some \textbf{performance} level $P_{i,t}$, typically close to their current skill $S_{i,t}$. The deviations $\{P_{i,t}-S_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$ are assumed to be i.i.d. and independent of $\{S_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$.

Performances are not observed directly; instead, a ranking gives the relative order among all performances $\{P_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$. In particular, ties are modelled to occur when performances are exactly equal, a zero-probability event when their distributions are continuous.\footnote{
%If $e$ contains ties, then $(E_t = e)$ has probability zero in our model. 
The relevant limiting procedure is to treat performances within $\epsilon$-width buckets as ties, and letting $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. This technicality appears in the proof of \Cref{thm:uniq-max}.} This ranking constitutes the observational \textbf{evidence} $E_t$ for our Bayesian updates. The rating system seeks to estimate the skill $S_{i,t}$ of every player at the present time $t$, given the historical round rankings $E_{\le t} := \{ E_1,\ldots,E_t \}$.

We overload the notation $\Pr$ for both probabilities and probability densities: the latter interpretation applies to zero-probability events, such as in $\Pr(S_{i,t} = s)$. We also use colons as shorthand for collections of variables differing only in a subscript: for instance, $P_{:,t}:=\{P_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$. The joint distribution described by our Bayesian model factorizes as follows:
\begin{align}
    &\Pr(S_{:,:}, P_{:,:}, E_:) \label{eq:model}
    \\&= \prod_i \Pr(S_{i,0})
    \prod_{i,t} \Pr(S_{i,t}\mid S_{i,t-1})
    \prod_{i,t} \Pr(P_{i,t}\mid S_{i,t})
    \prod_t \Pr(E_t\mid P_{:,t}), \nonumber
\end{align}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\begin{align*}
    \text{where } \Pr(S_{i,0}) &\text{ is the initial skill prior,}
    \\\Pr(S_{i,t}\mid S_{i,t-1}) &\text{ is the skill evolution model (\Cref{sec:skill-drift}),}
    \\\Pr(P_{i,t}\mid S_{i,t}) &\text{ is the performance model, and}
    \\\Pr(E_t\mid P_{:,t}) &\text{ is the evidence model.}
\end{align*}
For the first three factors, we will specify log-concave distributions (see \Cref{def:log-concave}). The evidence model, on the other hand, is a deterministic indicator. It equals one when $E_t$ is consistent with the relative ordering among $\{P_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$, and zero otherwise.

Finally, our model assumes that the number of participants $|\cP_t|$ is large. %(in practice, in the tens to thousands).
The main idea behind our algorithm is that, in sufficiently massive competitions, from the evidence $E_t$ we can infer very precise estimates for $\{P_{i,t}\}_{i\in\cP_t}$. Hence, we can treat these performances as if they were observed directly.
%\begin{theorem}
%Consider a round $t$ with player $i$ having performance $P_{i,t}$, and a set of participants $\cP_t$ drawn from the same distribution as player $i$. Suppose are prior believe on $P_{i,t}$ is continuous and has positive density at its true value. Then with probability 1, in the limit $|\cP_t|\rightarrow \infty$, the posterior belief on $P_{i, t}$ conditioned on $E_t$ concentrates around its true value. Furthermore,
%\[\lim_{|\cP_t|\rightarrow\infty} \Pr(S_{i,t}=s \mid P_{i,<t},\,E_t) = \Pr(S_{i,t} = s \mid P_{i, \leq t}). \]
%\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}

That is, suppose we have the skill prior at round $t$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pi-s}
\pi_{i,t}(s) := \Pr(S_{i,t} = s \mid P_{i,<t}).
\end{equation}

Now, we observe $E_t$. By \Cref{eq:model}, it is conditionally independent of $S_{i,t}$, given $P_{i,\le t}$. By the law of total probability,
\begin{align*}
&\Pr(S_{i,t}=s \mid P_{i,<t},\,E_t)
\\&= \int \Pr(S_{i,t}=s \mid P_{i,<t},\,P_{i,t}=p) \Pr(P_{i,t}=p \mid P_{i,<t},\,E_t) \, \mathrm{d}p
\\&\rightarrow \Pr(S_{i,t}=s \mid P_{i,\le t}) \quad\text{almost surely as }|\mathcal P_t|\rightarrow\infty.
\end{align*}
The integral is intractable in general, since the performance posterior $\Pr(P_{i,t}=p \mid P_{i,<t},\,E_t)$ depends not only on player $i$, but also on our belief regarding the skills of all $j\in\cP_t$. However, in the limit of infinite participants, Doob's consistency theorem \cite{F63} implies that it concentrates at the true value $P_{i,t}$. Since our posteriors are continuous, the convergence holds for all $s$ simultaneously.
%\end{proof}

Indeed, we don't even need the full evidence $E_t$. Let $E^L_{i,t} = \{j\in\cP:P_{j,t}>P_{i,t}\}$ be the set of players against whom $i$ lost, and $E^W_{i,t} = \{j\in\cP:P_{j,t}<P_{i,t}\}$ be the set of players against whom $i$ won. That is, we only see who wins, draws, and loses against $i$. $P_{i,t}$ remains identifiable using only $(E^L_{i,t}, E^W_{i,t})$, which will be more convenient for our purposes.

Passing to the limit $|\cP_t|\rightarrow\infty$ serves to justify some common simplifications made by algorithms such as TrueSkill: since conditioning on $P_{i,\le t}$ makes the skills of different players independent of one another, it becomes accurate to model them as such. In addition to simplifying derivations, this fact ensures that a player's posterior is unaffected by rounds in which they are not a participant, arguably a desirable property in its own right. Furthermore, $P_{i,\le t}$ being a sufficient statistic for skill prediction renders any additional information, such as domain-specific raw scores, redundant.

Finally, a word on the rate of convergence. Suppose we want our estimate to be within $\epsilon$ of $P_{i,t}$, with probability at least $1-\delta$. By asymptotic normality of the posterior~\cite{F63}, it suffices to have $O(\frac 1{\epsilon^2}\sqrt{\log \frac 1\delta})$ participants.

When the initial prior, performance model, and evolution model are all Gaussian, treating $P_{i,t}$ as certain is the \emph{only} simplifying approximation we will make; that is, in the limit $|\cP_t|\rightarrow\infty$, our method performs \emph{exact} inference on \Cref{eq:model}. In the following sections, we focus some attention on generalizing the performance model to non-Gaussian log-concave families, parametrized by location and scale. We will use the logistic distribution as a running example and see that it induces robustness; however, our framework is agnostic to the specific distributions used.%For non-Gaussian performance models, we will make a few additional approximations, but we resist the temptation to approximate the posteriors by something compact. 

The \textbf{rating} $\mu_{i,t}$ of player $i$ after round $t$ should be a statistic that summarizes their posterior distribution: we'll use the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, obtained by setting $s$ to maximize the posterior $\Pr(S_{i,t}=s \mid P_{i,\le t})$. By Bayes' rule,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:new-obj}
\mu_{i,t} := \argmax_{s} \pi_{i,t}(s) \Pr(P_{i,t} \mid S_{i,t}=s).
\end{equation}
This objective suggests a two-phase algorithm to update each player $i\in\cP_t$ at round $t$. In phase one, we estimate $P_{i,t}$ from $(E^L_{i,t}, E^W_{i,t})$. By Doob's consistency theorem, our estimate is extremely precise when $|\cP_t|$ is large, so we assume it to be exact. In phase two, we update our posterior for $S_{i,t}$ and the rating $\mu_{i,t}$ according to \Cref{eq:new-obj}.

We will occasionally make use of the \textbf{prior rating}, defined as
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{i,t}^\pi := \argmax_{s} \pi_{i,t}(s).
\end{equation*}
