\section{Conclusions and Future Works}

\md{In this paper, we show that any graph shuffle can be done by PSSs. 
In particular, we need $2(n+m)$ cards and $|\f{Deg}_G|+1$ PSSs, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of vertices and arrows of $G$, respectively. 
We left as open problems (1) to remove the computation of an isomorphism between two isomorphic graphs in a graph shuffle protocol keeping everything efficient and (2) to find another interesting applications for our graph shuffle protocol. 
We hope that this research direction (i.e., constructing a nontrivial shuffle from the standard shuffles such as RCs, RBCs, and PSSs) will attract the interest of researchers on card-based cryptography and new shuffle protocols will be proposed in future work.
