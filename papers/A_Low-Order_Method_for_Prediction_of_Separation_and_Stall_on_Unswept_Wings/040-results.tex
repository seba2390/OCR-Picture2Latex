\section{Results}
\label{sec:unswept-results}

The low-order method (LOM) described above was tested for multiple unswept wing geometries using viscous airfoil data, obtained from wind-tunnel experiments and from 2D RANS CFD solutions, as input. The \methodname was tested using airfoils of various maximum thickness for rectangular and tapered wing planforms. In addition to steady flight conditions, the \methodname was tested in the quasi-steady regime by applying a small, constant roll-rate to the wings. Results from the \methodabbr are compared against experimental observations from literature and 3D RANS CFD solutions for the geometries and flight conditions listed in \tref{tab:geoms}

{The lifting surface for each geometry was calculated and discretized into a lattice of 20 spanwise and 40 chordwise panels. Since the decambering shape is implemented in the \methodabbr by rotating the normal vectors of the panels, insufficient chordwise discretization can cause problems with convergence. Therefore, a fairly large number of chordwise panels (when compared with traditional VLMs) is used to ensure sufficient sensitivity of the method to the decambering shape. The code, implemented in Python 3.6 and optimized using the NumPy 1.16.2 package compiled with the Intel MKL libraries to perform vectorized linear algebra operations, ran on an Apple MacBook Air (2.2Ghz Dual-Core Intel i7) in 8-12 minutes for all cases.}

\secref{sec:exp-results} presents case A, in which results are obtained from the low-order method using the 2D viscous input curves obtained in the wind tunnel experiments by  Ostowari and Naik \cite{naik_ostowari_nrel}.
These predictions are compared against 3D experimental results from the same source.

Results presented in subsequent sections were obtained using 2D viscous input curves obtained from 2D RANS simulations performed using ANSYS Fluent on the NCSU HPC cluster. Details about the CFD simulations are given in \secref{sec:cfd-meth}. %

% Results from the \methodabbr are shown along with the CFD solutions for the viscous airfoil curves used as input data in \secref{sec:airfoil-results}
The total wing loads ($C_L, C_D, C_M$) predicted by the \methodabbr are compared against CFD solutions in \secref{sec:total-loads} for a rectangular wing with a symmetric 12\% thick airfoil (Case B) and a cambered 15\% thick airfoil (Case C).
% \methodabbr results show excellent agreement with CFD results.
\secref{sec:spanwise-loads} compares the low-order predictions of spanwise distributions of $C_l$ and $C_m$, and separation lines for these wings against the CFD solutions.
% \PHNote{separation lines not yet plotted.}
The \methodname accounts for the effects of the separated boundary layer by ``decambering'' the wing sections, effectively changing its shape.
The decambered wing-sections are overlaid on the contour of $V/V_\infty$ in \secref{sec:dec-shape} to illustrate the resemblance of the decambered airfoil shape to the shape of the separated boundary layer.
The effectiveness of the \methodname in predicting the characteristics of tapered wings is demonstrated in \secref{sec:tapered-wings} for a wing with taper ratio $\lambda = 0.5$. \secref{sec:rolling-wings} illustrates the utility of the \methodname in quasi-steady cases, such as when a small, constant roll-rate is present, for both rectangular and tapered wings.
Finally, \secref{sec:limitations} presents results for a swept wing and discusses the limitations in the method and motivates efforts to develop a correction for swept geometries.

\subsection{CFD Methodology for 3D Wings}
\label{sec:cfd-meth}
The low-order method does not require any input data from 3-dimensional CFD solutions. However, 3D CFD solutions for each of the wing geometries described above were obtained to evaluate the accuracy of the low-order method. Using the procedure described in Ref. \cite{Jamwal2018}, body-conforming structured meshes having a wall $y^+ = 1$  were generated for each geometry using the multi-blocking Hexa algorithm in ANSYS ICEM-CFD. These meshes, having cell counts ranging from 20M--45M cells, were used to obtain time-accurate solutions at $Re = 3\times10^6$ in ANSYS Fluent. A physical timestep of 0.01s was used for a total of 300 timesteps. The Spalart-Allmaras model was used for turbulence closure.
\revnote{Time-accurate simulations were performed to ensure that the CFD solutions would converge at the high post-stall angles of attack where the inherently unsteady flow prevents steady simulations from converging. The CFD results shown in this work are the mean values of each quantity over one oscillation.}{\#3.14}
A detailed explanation of the CFD methodology is given in Ref. \cite{AbhimanyuThesis}. The total and spanwise load distributions are obtained from the CFD solutions for comparison with low-order predictions. The separation line is obtained from plots of skin-friction lines on the upper surface of the wing.

% \subsection{Airfoil Behavior}
% \label{sec:airfoil-results}
% The nonlinear decambering method was first tested for geometries with $\ar = 10000$, which are practically identical to a two-dimensional airfoil of infinite aspect ratio. Predictions for the coefficients of lift, drag, and moment are shown in
% % \multiref{f}{fig:n4415-airfoil-coeffs}{fig:n0012-airfoil-coeffs}.
% \fref{fig:airfoil-coeffs}.
% The results presented are obtained from three sources:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{CFD:} Results obtained from RANS CFD solutions.
%     \item{\emph{Inv. LOM:} Results obtained from the inviscid vortex lattice method, as described by Katz and Plotkin \cite{katz_plotkin_book_1991}}
%     \item \emph{Visc. LOM:} Results obtained from the VLM augmented with the nonlinear decambering method, which is the low-order method described in this chapter.
% \end{itemize}

% At low angles of attack, the results from the inviscid LOM adequately predict the lift and moment coefficients for the airfoils. Since potential-flow methods are incapable of predicting profile drag, the inviscid method gives $C_d = 0$ for all airfoils for all angles of attack. As the angle of attack is increased, the inviscid prediction starts deviating from the viscous CFD solution. The nonlinear decambering accurately recreates the drop in lift and moment and increase in drag for angles of attack up to 40\degree.

% However, this is not surprising -- since the viscous LOM is given the viscous $C_l$, $C_d$, and $C_m$ CFD curves as input, the accurate match with the input data is simply included as a sanity check. In the following sections, we use the two-dimensional input curves to obtain predictions from the viscous LOM for three-dimensional wings having various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and roll rates.

\subsection{Wing Lift, Drag, and Moment Predictions}
\label{sec:total-loads}

The total coefficients of lift, drag, and pitching moment  up to $\alpha=35\degree$ are presented below. For all these cases, viscous input curves for $C_l$, $C_d$, $C_m$, and $f$ vs. $\alpha$, shown in \fref{fig:cfd-coeffs}, were obtained from 2D CFD solutions at the appropriate Reynolds numbers.

% \PHNote{Final conclusion}

% At low angles of attack, the wing experiences a negative rolling moment, i.e. in the direction opposite to the roll. As the angle of attack increases, this restoring moment reduces and, after stall, the rolling moment acts in the direction of the rotation. This trend is correctly predicted by the low-order method.
