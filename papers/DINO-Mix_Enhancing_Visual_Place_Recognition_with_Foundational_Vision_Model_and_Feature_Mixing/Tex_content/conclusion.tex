In this paper, we proposed a novel VPR framework, called DINO-Mix. First, we modified and fine-tuned the structure of the DINOv2 model. We then converted the extracted features from the backbone network into feature maps and employed the mixed feature aggregation module to aggregate these feature maps to obtain global feature vectors. The experimental results on various test sets demonstrate that the proposed DINO-Mix model outperforms SOTA methods in terms of VPR accuracy, with an average improvement of $5.14\%$ across test sets containing challenging conditions. Furthermore, through a series of image retrieval examples under difficult circumstances, we demonstrated that the performance of the DINO-Mix architecture significantly surpasses that of current SOTA architectures. We identified that changes in illumination pose a significant challenge. Therefore, our future work will focus on enhancing images with poor lighting conditions through image augmentation techniques to further improve the VPR accuracy.
