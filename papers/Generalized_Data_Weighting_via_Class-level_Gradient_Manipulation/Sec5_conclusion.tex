\section{Conclusion}
Many instance weighting methods have recently been proposed to tackle label noise and class imbalance, but they cannot capture class-level information.
%
For better information use when handling the two issues, we propose GDW to generalize data weighting from instance level to class level by reweighting gradient flows.
%
Besides, to efficiently obtain class-level weights, we design a two-stage weight generation scheme which is embedded in a three-step bi-level optimization framework and leverages intermediate gradients to update class-level weights via a gradient descent step.
%
In this way, GDW achieves remarkable performance improvement in various settings.

%
The limitations of GDW are two-fold.
%
Firstly, the gradient manipulation is only applicable to single-label classification tasks.
%
When applied to multi-label tasks, the formulation of gradient manipulation need some modifications.
%
Secondly, GDW does not outperform comparison methods by a large margin in class imbalance settings despite the potential effectiveness analyzed in Section~\ref{sec:imbalance}.
%
One possible explanation is that better information utilization may not result in performance gain which also depends on various other factors.
