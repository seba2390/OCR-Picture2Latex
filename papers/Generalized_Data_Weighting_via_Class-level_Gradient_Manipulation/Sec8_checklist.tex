\section{Checklist}

\begin{enumerate}

\item For all authors...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
    \answerYes{}
  \item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
    \answerYes{The proposed method can only be applied on classification tasks.}
  \item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
    \answerYes{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are including theoretical results...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{method}.}
	\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{method}.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you ran experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
    \answerYes{We only use public datasets and the code is in the supplementary materials.}
  \item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
    \answerYes{Most of our settings follow \cite{shuMetaWeightNetLearningExplicit2019a} and other details are in the appendix.}
	\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
    \answerYes{We repeat all experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with five different seeds and the mean and standard deviation are reported. For the Clothing1M dataset, we only run one experiment due to limited resources.}
	\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
    \answerYes{We use one V100 GPU. See the appendix for details.}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
    \answerYes{For dataset, we cite the papers of CIFAR datasets and the Clothing1M dataset. For code, we cite \cite{heDeepResidualLearning2016}.}
  \item Did you mention the license of the assets?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you include any new assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}

\item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects...
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?
    \answerNA{}
  \item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
    \answerNA{}
\end{enumerate}
