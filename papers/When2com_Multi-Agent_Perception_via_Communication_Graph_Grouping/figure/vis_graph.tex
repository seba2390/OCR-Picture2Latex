        \textbf{Bipartite communication graph between supporting and requesting agents.}  During the query phase, each requesting agent sends a low-dimensional query vector to all other agents (including itself) to establish communication.  Then during the transmission phase, supporting agents transmit their high-dimensional feature representations.  We visualize the flow of data during the transmission phase, where blue and red arrows refer to internal and external communication, respectively.  More prominent colors and larger numerical values indicate stronger feature weightings, whereas missing arrows represent the pruned links in the communication graph.  Note that these images are ordered for visualization purposes; the actual dataset is unordered, and each agent observes a random class with a random chance of degradation.}
