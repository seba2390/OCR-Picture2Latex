        \textbf{Fully connected versus group communication.} Fully connected communication results in a large amount of bandwidth usage, growing on the order of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ represents the number of agents in a network. Group communication is able to prune irrelevant connections and can substantially reduce the overall network complexity.
