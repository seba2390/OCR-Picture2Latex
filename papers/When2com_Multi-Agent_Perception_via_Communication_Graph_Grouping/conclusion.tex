\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a general bandwidth-efficient communication framework for collaborative perception. Our framework learns both how to construct communication groups and when to communicate. This framework can be generalized to several down-stream tasks including (but not limited to) multi-agent semantic segmentation and multi-agent 3D shape recognition. We demonstrated superior performance with lower bandwidth requirements across all compared methods.
