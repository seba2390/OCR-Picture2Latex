\subsection{Problem Definition and Notation}
We assume an environment consisting $\bm{N}$ agents with their own observations $\bm{X}=\{\bm{x}_n\}_{n=1,...,\bm{N}}$.
Among those agents, some of them are degraded $\tilde{\bm{X}} = \{\tilde{\bm{x}}_l\}_{l=1,..,\bm{L}}$, and the set of degraded agents is a subset of all agents $\tilde{\bm{X}}\subset\bm{X}$. 
Each agent outputs the prediction of perception task $\tilde{\bm{Y}}=\{\bm{\tilde{y}}_n\}_{n=1,...,\bm{N}}$ with the proposed communication mechanism. 
Note that each agent is a \textbf{\textit{requester}} and \textbf{\textit{supporter}} simultaneously. 
However, which agents are degraded is \textbf{unknown} in our problem setting.
