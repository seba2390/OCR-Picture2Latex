\section{Method}

The goal of our proposed model is to address the multi-agent collaborative perception problem, where an agent is able to improve its perception by receiving information from other agents. In this paper, we are specifically interested in \textit{learning to construct communication groups} and \textit{learning when to communicate} in a bandwidth-limited way.
