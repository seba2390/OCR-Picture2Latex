\section{Conclusion}
We modeled the problem of identification of elite customers and preferential returns processing for them as a two-player repeated game and solved for its equilibrium strategy. We designed an algorithm based on this analysis and evaluated the algorithm on real-world data available at Myntra. We note that our algorithm is scalable, easy to implement and has performance comparable to classification algorithms like logistic regression and random forests. Moreover it has the advantage of explainability.
