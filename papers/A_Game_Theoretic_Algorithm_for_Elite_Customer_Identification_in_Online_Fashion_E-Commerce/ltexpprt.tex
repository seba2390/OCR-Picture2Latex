Myntra is an online fashion e-commerce company based in India. At Myntra, a market leader in fashion e-commerce in India, customer experience is paramount and a significant portion of our resources are dedicated to it. Here we describe an algorithm that identifies eligible customers to enable preferential product return processing for them by Myntra. We declare the group of aforementioned eligible customers on the platform as elite customers. Our algorithm to identify eligible/elite customers is based on sound principles of game theory. It is simple, easy to implement and scalable.
