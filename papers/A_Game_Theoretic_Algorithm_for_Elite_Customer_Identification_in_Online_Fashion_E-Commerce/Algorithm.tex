Our algorithm given the sequence of purchases of a customer in 9 months into the past on the  platform estimates the probability of repetition $\delta$. We say that the game is repeated on the condition that the time gap between consecutive purchases of the customer is less than or equal to 90 days. We count the number of times the game is repeated utilizing the purchase sequence of the customer and estimate the probability of repetition $\delta$. The choices -9 months, 90 days- for time periods to estimate $\delta$ are motivated by business requirements.

We collect the historical product return compliance status of the customer. With these quantities at its disposal the algorithm compares the repetition probability estimate with the threshold $\tau$ and assigns eliteness to the customer. We note that with our utility matrix we get that $\tau = 0.5$.

We note that our algorithm is very intuitive. In summary it classifies a customer as elite if his frequency of purchases is more than 0.5 and has perfect returns compliance history. We also note that our algorithm is dynamic. As the 9 month window is dynamic the elite group of customers changes with time and a given customer is required to be a frequent purchaser from Myntra to be consistently elite.
