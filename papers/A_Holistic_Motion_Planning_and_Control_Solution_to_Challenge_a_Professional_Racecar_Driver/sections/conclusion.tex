In this paper we proposed a holistic way to think about motion planner and controller design for autonomous racing.
The idea is that all hierarchical control layers should be designed while keeping the other layers in mind.
We proposed a low-level controller that actuates the steering, and distributes the wheel torques to track the acceleration, yaw rate and steering trajectories predicted by a higher level NMPC.
The higher level motion planners consider the torque vectoring capabilities of the low-level controller. Thus, the model mismatch between the levels can be reduced while the capabilities of the car can be fully extracted. 
We show this by comparing the performance of our autonomous controller with a professional human driver both driving the same full-sized autonomous racecar. 
Our autonomous controller is able to better the driver both in peak and average lap-times. Future work will include real-time identification of the peak tire performance to benefit from the full grip potential, and data-driven learning of the cost function.
