\appendix

% \section{Checklist continue}

Include extra information in the appendix. This section will often be part of the supplemental material. Please see the call on the NeurIPS website for links to additional guides on dataset publication.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Submission introducing new datasets must include the following in the supplementary materials: \answerYes{}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dataset documentation and intended uses. Recommended documentation frameworks include datasheets for datasets, dataset nutrition labels, data statements for NLP, and accountability frameworks.
  \item URL to website/platform where the dataset/benchmark can be viewed and downloaded by the reviewers. \answerYes{} They have been entered in the submission system.
  \item Author statement that they bear all responsibility in case of violation of rights, etc., and confirmation of the data license. \answerNA{} Physionet is for credentialed access. In order to use the dataset, researchers will have to individually undergo HIPPA training and obtain data use agreement from Physionet.
  \item Hosting, licensing, and maintenance plan. The choice of hosting platform is yours, as long as you ensure access to the data (possibly through a curated interface) and will provide the necessary maintenance. \answerYes{} Project is hosted by Physionet which is maintained by the Laboratory of Computational Physiology at MIT.
\end{enumerate}

\item To ensure accessibility, the supplementary materials for datasets must include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Links to access the dataset and its metadata. This can be hidden upon submission if the dataset is not yet publicly available but must be added in the camera-ready version. In select cases, e.g when the data can only be released at a later date, this can be added afterward. Simulation environments should link to (open source) code repositories. \answerYes{} The dataset has been submitted to Physionet and awaits approval from Physionet reviewers but we do not expect it to be rejected. 
  \item The dataset itself should ideally use an open and widely used data format. Provide a detailed explanation on how the dataset can be read. For simulation environments, use existing frameworks or explain how they can be used. \answerYes{} All data are in .JSON or .CSV formats that can be easily read. Additional Jupyter Notebooks were submitted with the Physionet submission to help users understand and use the dataset.
  \item Long-term preservation: It must be clear that the dataset will be available for a long time, either by uploading to a data repository or by explaining how the authors themselves will ensure this. \answerYes{} Physionet will be around for a long time. Authors also plan on building upon this dataset in future work.
  \item Explicit license: Authors must choose a license, ideally a CC license for datasets, or an open source license for code (e.g. RL environments). \answerYes{} This is the license chosen: https://physionet.org/projects/BOFnNTGyCvTT6GMLVzeS/view-license/
  \item Add structured metadata to a dataset's meta-data page using Web standards (like schema.org and DCAT): This allows it to be discovered and organized by anyone. If you use an existing data repository, this is often done automatically. \answerYes{} Data are available through PhysioNet, a standard repository for medical research data
  \item Highly recommended: a persistent dereferenceable identifier (e.g. a DOI minted by a data repository or a prefix on identifiers.org) for datasets, or a code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab,...) for code. If this is not possible or useful, please explain why. \answerYes{} The dataset is available on PhysioNet for public viewing (\url{https://doi.org/10.13026/wv01-y230}) and can be downloaded by any MIMIC credentialed researchers.
\end{enumerate}

\item For benchmarks, the supplementary materials must ensure that all results are easily reproducible. Where possible, use a reproducibility framework such as the ML reproducibility checklist, or otherwise guarantee that all results can be easily reproduced, i.e. all necessary datasets, code, and evaluation procedures must be accessible and documented. \answerYes{} The dataset and it's related statistics are all documented in Jupyter Notebooks with the Physionet commit (which the reviewers can see) and described in this paper or the supplementary material. The code for the example experiments will be made available on github in the camera ready version if the work is accepted.

\item For papers introducing best practices in creating or curating datasets and benchmarks, the above supplementary materials are not required.
