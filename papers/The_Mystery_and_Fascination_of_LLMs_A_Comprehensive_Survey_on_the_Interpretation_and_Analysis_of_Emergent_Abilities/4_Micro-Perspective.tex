\section{Interpreting Emergent Abilities from Micro Perspective}
From a micro perspective, research predominantly emphasizes empirical probing, focusing on the factors that influence the emergent abilities of LLMs.
 These factors encompass variations in results across downstream tasks, driven by aspects such as the quality of pre-training data \citep{Chan2022DataDP, Razeghi2022ImpactOP, Shin2022OnTE, Razeghi2022ImpactOP, Power2022GrokkingGB}, the quality of the provided examples \citep{Lu2021FantasticallyOP, Liu2021WhatMG, Wang2022TowardsUC, Turpin2023LanguageMD}, and mappings of demonstration labels \citep{Min2022RethinkingTR,Kossen2023InContextLI,Wei2023LargerLM,Kim2022GroundTruthLM}.
