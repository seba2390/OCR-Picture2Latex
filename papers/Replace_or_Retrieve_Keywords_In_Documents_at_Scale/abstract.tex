In this paper we introduce, the FlashText~\footnote{ FlashText tool for finding or replacing keywords: \url{https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext}} algorithm for replacing keywords or finding keywords in a given text. FlashText can search or replace keywords in one pass over a document. The time complexity of this algorithm is not dependent on the number of terms being searched or replaced. For a document of size \textbf{N} (characters) and a dictionary of \textbf{M} keywords, the time complexity will be \textbf{O(N)}. This algorithm is much faster than Regex (see Figure 1 \& 2), because regex time complexity is \textbf{O(M * N)}. It is also different from Aho Corasick Algorithm~\footnote{ Aho Corasick algorithm: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Corasick_algorithm}} as it doesn’t match sub-strings.\hfill\break

FlashText is designed to only match complete words (words with boundary characters~\footnote{ ‘\textbackslash b’ represents word boundaries in regex: \url{https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html}} on both sides). For an input dictionary of \textit{\{Apple\}}, this algorithm won’t match it to \textit{‘I like Pineapple’}. This algorithm is also designed to go for the longest match first. For an input dictionary \textit{\{Machine, Learning, Machine learning\}} on a string \textit{‘I like Machine learning’}, it will only consider the longest match, which is \textit{Machine Learning}.\hfill\break

We have made python implementation of this algorithm available as open-source on GitHub, released under the permissive MIT License.\hfill\break
