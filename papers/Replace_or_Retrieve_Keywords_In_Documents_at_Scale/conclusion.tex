\section*{CONCLUSION}
As we saw, FlashText is fast and well suited for keyword search/replace. Itâ€™s much faster than Regex when the keywords are complete. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in length of the searched text. It is specially useful when the number of keywords is large since all keywords can be simultaneously matched in one pass over the input string.
