  \noindent Ionization with ultrashort pulses in the extreme
  ultraviolet (XUV) regime can be used to prepare an ion in a
  superposition of spin--orbit substates. In this work, we study the
  coherence properties of such a superposition, created by ionizing
  xenon atoms using two phase-locked XUV pulses at different
  frequencies. In general, if the duration of the driving pulse
  exceeds the quantum beat period, dephasing will occur. If however,
  the frequency difference of the two pulses matches the spin--orbit
  splitting, the coherence can be efficiently increased and dephasing
  does not occur.
