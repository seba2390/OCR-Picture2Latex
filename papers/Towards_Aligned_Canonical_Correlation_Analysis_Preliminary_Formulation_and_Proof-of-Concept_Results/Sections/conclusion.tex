In this preliminary work we investigated the joint CCA-style embedding of multiview data and the simultaneous alignment of the embedded entities, by breaking the traditional assumption in CCA that predicates a known one-to-one matching across views. We proposed an initial formulation for Aligned Canonical Correlation Analysis (ACCA) and derived an alternating optimization algorithm that produces proof-of-concept results for the viability of this formulation. However, there is still a lot of work to be done, and we hope that our preliminary results can serve as a stepping stone to further research in this direction.

In our on-going and future work we will investigate variations of the formulation and improvements of the optimization scheme, especially as it pertains to solving for the alignment matrix, which, even though has been radically simplified compared to solving for a permutation matrix, is still a major challenge both in terms of scalability as well as in terms of finding a precise alignment matrix. Furthermore, we would like to study the alignment matrix as a graph and introduce graph-based constraints which may further improve optimization.
Finally, we will investigate connections between our proposed Aligned Canonical Correlation Analysis model and self-supervised representation learning models.
