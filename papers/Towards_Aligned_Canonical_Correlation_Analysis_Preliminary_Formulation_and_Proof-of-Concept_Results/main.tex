\begin{abstract}
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) has been a tried and tested analytical model which seeks to jointly embed two or more views of the data in a maximally correlated latent space. In addition to a powerful data mining tool, CCA has many implications for cutting-edge self-supervised representation learning approaches, as one can cast a number of recent approaches as variants of that model. In this work we explore what happens when a fundamental assumption of that model breaks: what if the alignment across different views of the data is unknown? Typically, we would first attempt to align the different views, and subsequently apply CCA or any other model in order to embed the data views. Can we do better if we align and embed at the same time? In this work, we seek to jointly solve the alignment and embedding by formulating and solving both problems under the same umbrella of Aligned Canonical Correlation Analysis (ACCA). We present a preliminary formulation and alternating optimization algorithm and proof-of-concept results.
