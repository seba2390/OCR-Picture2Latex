\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}

In this work we consider symbolic algorithms for graphs and MDPs with 
Streett objectives, as well as for MEC decomposition. 
Our algorithmic bounds match for both graphs and MDPs. 
In contrast, while SCCs can be computed in linearly many symbolic steps no such
algorithm is known for MEC decomposition.
An interesting direction of future work would be to explore further 
improved symbolic algorithms for MEC decomposition.
Moreover, further improved symbolic algorithms for graphs and MDPs with Streett
objectives is also an interesting direction of future work.
