In this work, we proposed a distributed GAN learning framework as a solution to the privacy restriction problem in multiple health entities. Our proposed framework applies GAN to aggregate and learns the overall distribution of datasets in different health entities without direct access to patients' data. The well-trained generator can be used as an image provider for training task-specific models, without accessing or storing private patients' data. Our evaluation on different datasets shows that our training framework could learn the real image's distribution from distributed datasets without sharing the patient's raw data. In addition, the task-specific model trained solely by synthetic data has a competitive performance with the model trained by all real data, and outperforms models trained by local data in each medical entity.
