A core operation in data discovery is to find joinable tables for a given table.
Real-world tables include both unary and n-ary join keys. However, existing table discovery systems are optimized for unary joins and are ineffective and slow in the existence of n-ary keys.
In this paper, we introduce \system, a table discovery system that leverages a novel hash-based index that enables n-ary join discovery through a space-efficient super key.
We design a filtering layer that uses a novel hash, \hash. This hash function encodes the syntactic features of all column values and aggregates them into a super key, which allows the system to efficiently prune tables with non-joinable rows.
Our join discovery system is able to prune up to $1000x$ more false positives and leads to over $60x$ faster table discovery in comparison to state-of-the-art.
