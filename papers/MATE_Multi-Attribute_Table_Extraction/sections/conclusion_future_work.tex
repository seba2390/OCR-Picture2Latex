\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we tackled the problem of n-ary or multi-attribute join search. We proposed a hash-based filtering approach \system that removes redundant table rows from further joinability calculation processes to increase the scalability of the join discovery. We proposed \hash, a hash function that leverages syntactic features of the cell values that ultimately lead to the lowest FP rates. We showed that \system is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art systems.
We focused on the equi-joins. Because \hash uses syntactic features including the character and length features of the cell values, it has the potential to discover similarity joins as well. According to our observations, the false positives caused by \hash were those that are syntactically similar to the actual key values, e.g., discovering the composite key <``brooklyn'', ``cambridge''> instead of <``brooklyn'', ``bay ridge''>. 
Another future direction is to reason about hashing short key values. \hash cannot use its optimal potential if cell values are too short.
