We presented a novel study on the task of sentence-level supporting argument detection from relevant documents for a user-specified claim. Based on our newly-collected dataset, we characterized arguments of different types with a rich feature set. We also showed that leveraging argument type information can further improve the performance of supporting argument detection.

%In this paper we study how to identify supporting arguments under debate settings by leveraging argument type information. And we annotate a debate corpus with sentence level type information to facilitate automatic detection. Experimental results indicate the type information can help improve detection performance. 

%Due to the difficulties lie in the nature of this problem, there are still many interesting aspects worth pursing in the future. For example, how human edits the original sentences into different variations; how to better utilize the context information to identify the source, and the techniques used to synthesize different arguments into a coherent paragraph.
