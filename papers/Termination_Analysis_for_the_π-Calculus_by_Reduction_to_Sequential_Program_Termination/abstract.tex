\begin{abstract}  %
  We propose an automated method for proving termination of \(\pi\)-calculus processes,
  based on a reduction to termination of sequential programs: 
  we translate a \(\pi\)-calculus process to a sequential program,
  so that the termination of the latter implies that of the former.
  We can then use an off-the-shelf termination
  verification tool to check termination of the sequential program.
  Our approach has been partially inspired by Deng and Sangiorgi's termination analysis for
  the \(\pi\)-calculus, and checks that there is no infinite chain of communications on
  replicated input channels, by converting such a chain of communications 
  to a chain of recursive function calls in the target sequential program.
  We have implemented an automated tool based on the proposed method and confirmed its effectiveness.
