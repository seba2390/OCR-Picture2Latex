\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec.eval}

In this section, 
  we evaluate our prototype 
  %to evaluate 
  for end-to-end testing with \AppNum applications and three accelerator designs. We focus especially on
  %As part of this we also evaluate 
\begin{inlinelist}
\item automated identification of acceleration opportunities, and 
\item application-level validation using automated co-simulation.   
\end{inlinelist}

%\hl{Without the {\TLA} methodology, similar evaluation would require developing extensive bespoke compiler and simulation infrastructure, perhaps via BYOC. 
%We demonstrate that efficient end-to-end evaluation can be facilitated by a modular, extensible workflow with reusable components.}
Note that other tools provide very little automated support (if any)
%no existing automated methodology or tool addresses 
for these two capabilities, thus precluding any head-to-head comparisons. 
%Additionally, the prototype is focused on enabling testing,
  %rather than optimization,
% not intended to be
%   an optimizing compiler,
  %so we do not evaluate the performance
  %of the generated code.
%Besides the two focuses, we 
We also report on operator-level evaluation (accuracy and performance) and FPGA-based deployment.
%Further, {\TLA} is not intended to be a full-fledged compiler, and thus is not being evaluated in the performance of the compiled code or against other compilers.

%As part of assessing its end-to-end testing capabilities, we assess its ability 
  %to automatically identify acceleration opportunities.
%These trials demonstrate the capabilities afforded by the {\TLA} methodology, \hl{with a relative ease of implementation -- AG: unclear?}.
% baseline: you're stuck with BYOC and software simulation. our approach is the first that provides a mostly automated path to these results (establish these as our research questions)
%\hl{TODO @zach: say something about baseline}
%We show the generality of the {\TLA} methodology through case studies covering multiple DL applications and accelerators.
