\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have devised, explained, implemented, and evaluated a comprehensive platform for authoring and executing serverless workflows. We have shown that, compared to prevailing approaches, (1) the DF programming model improves the developer experience and broadens the scope of supported applications, and (2) the Netherite architecture improves the performance across the board, by orders of magnitude in some cases. Our work enables the development of full-featured, stateful, serverless applications that extend far beyond the scope of the original FaaS concept.

In future work, we would like to explore how to extend CCC to external services, and how to further improve Netherite by smarter scheduling of tasks and steps. \hide{\dajusto{grammar nit: replace "by smarter" with "via smarter" or "with smarter"}}
