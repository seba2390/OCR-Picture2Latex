\caption[]{{Illustration of the antenna gains Fourier model \citep[courtesy][]{Thouvenin2018}. The gains ${\Db}_{\alpha} \in \eC^{T\times N}$, associated with antenna $\alpha$, are complex-valued modulations of the sky, varying in time. Given their compact spatio-temporal Fourier representation $\Ub_{\alpha}\in \eC^{P \times S}$, the gains are obtained as $ \Db_{\alpha} =  \overline{\Fb}_{\textrm{1D}}^\dagger \Ub_{\alpha} \overline{\Fb}_{\textrm{2D}}^\ast $. For illustration purposes, in their original temporal and image space, the gains are assumed to have a dimension $\sqrt{N}$ in both spatial directions. Similarly, the compact Fourier representation of the gains is assumed to have a dimension $\sqrt{S}$ in both spatial directions.}
