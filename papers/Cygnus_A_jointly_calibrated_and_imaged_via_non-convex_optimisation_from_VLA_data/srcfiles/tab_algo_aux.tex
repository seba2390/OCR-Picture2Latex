 {{	\caption{The parameters involved in the stopping of criteria of the different iterative cycles of Algorithm~\ref{algo:VMBCFB}. In essence, each iterative cycle stops when the fixed number of iteration is reached. However, near convergence, an iterative cycle can be stopped earlier if the relative variation of the associated estimate reaches a configurable lower bound.}
