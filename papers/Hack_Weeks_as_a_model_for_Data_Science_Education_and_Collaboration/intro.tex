As data becomes cheaper to gather and store, research across a wide range of disciplines has become increasingly reliant on computational workflows involving a familiarity with aspects of statistical modeling, machine learning, scalable computation, and related skills. In addition, the recent reproducibility crises in several scientific fields has led to the growing realization that improving awareness of open science and reproducibility as well as practical skills in making research reproducible is essential to scientific progress \cite{pashler2012,frye2015,gezelter2015,baker2016}.
Formal university curricula have been relatively slow to offer courses in these important topics: the slack in this area has often been picked-up by extra-curricular, ad-hoc efforts such as workshops (an overview and typography of such efforts in the data science context can be found in \cite{demasi2017}).
Well-known examples are the Software and Data Carpentry workshops providing training in research computing skills through a volunteer instructor program  \cite{b:wilson-swc-lessons-2016,teal2015data}.
At the same time, there has been a rise in the number of domain-specific courses focusing on statistics and computation within their field.
Examples include the \textit{Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers}\footnote{\url{http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su16/}}, the Google Earth Engine User Summits\footnote{\url{https://events.withgoogle.com/google-earth-engine-user-summit-2017/}}, as well as a variety of project-focused (rather than pedagogical) meetings, such as the dotAstronomy meetings\footnote{\url{http://dotastronomy.com}}.
Shorter, but similar-spirit meetings have been held in conjunction with conferences, such as the Hack Days at the annual American Astronomical Society meetings, the Brainhack hackathons that take place in conjunction with meetings of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping and the Society for Neuroscience\cite{Cameron_Craddock2016-wc}, and a hackathon at the American Geophysical Union meeting\footnote{\url{http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EO480004/pdf}}.
Generally, pedagogically-focused events follow a classic academic model where novices learn new skills from experts, while project-focused workshops emphasize collaborative activities using existing skills.
A disadvantage of the pedagogical model is that it can tends to focus on a one-way flow of information from instructor to student, and can discount the potential contributions by students.
A disadvantage of the project model is the common perception that the week is designed for technical experts, which may discourage others from attending.
In 2014, we initiated an alternative model of ``Hack Weeks'' that try to fill the gaps between these models.
These are week-long events that combine pedagogy (often focused on statistical and computational techniques) together with time for hacks and creative projects, and with the goal of encouraging collaboration and learning among people at various stages of their career.

As of the publication of this paper, we have run eight such hack week events: four focused on Astronomy, two focused on Neuroscience, and two focused on Geoscience.
Below we will share some of the philosophy behind the hack week model, practical lessons we have learned in organizing these events, and recommendations for future hack weeks in other disciplines.
