We describe the tube algebra and its representations in the cases of diagonal and Bisch-Haagerup subfactors possibly with a scalar $ 3 $-cocycle obstruction. We show that these categories are additively equivalent to the direct product over conjugacy classes of representation category of a centralizer subgroup (corresponding to the conjugacy class) twisted by a scalar $ 2 $-cocycle obtained from the $ 3 $-cocycle obstruction.

\section{Introduction}
Annular representations of planar algebras were introduced by Vaughan Jones in \cite{Jon3} to construct subfactors with principal graphs $E_6$ and $E_8$. In the same paper,
he explicitly worked out the Temperley-Lieb example.
These calculations helped in construction of new examples such as \cite{Pet}.
Recently, annular representations of subfactors and semisimple rigid $ C^* $-tensor categories have become a very interesting area of research.
%Annular representations of subfactors and semisimple rigid $ C^* $-tensor categories have recently become a very interesting area of research.
%The annular Temperley-Lieb modules (see \cite{Jon3}) helped in construction of new examples such as \cite{Pet}.
The annular representation category turns out to be a nice braided tensor category - not necessarily semisimple - which is equivalent to the center of the original bimodule / $ C^* $-tensor category in the case of finite depth / fusion categories (see \cite{DGG1}, \cite{DGG2}, \cite{GJ}).
For general depth, this category becomes equivalent to the center of a certain induced category (which is basically an extension where infinite direct sums are allowed) - see \cite{NY}, \cite{PV}.
There is also an analytic aspect of the annular representation category.
Analytic properties, such as, amenabilty, Haagerup property, property (T) of the subfactor / $ C^* $-tensor category can be reinterpreted in terms of annular representations.
%In fact, annular representations were used by Corey Jones (in \cite{CJon}) to establish property (T) for the quantum $ G_2 $ categories.

In this paper, we deal with two group-type subfactors - the so-called diagonal and the Bisch-Haagerup ones - possibly with $ 3 $-cocyle obstruction.
The approximation properties of these two examples are well-known and depend on the associated group (see \cite{frenchpop}, \cite{Pop94} for diagonal and \cite{BH} for Bisch-Haagerup).
We determine the annular representation category.
For this, we borrow techniques from \cite{GJ}, namely, we fix a `full' weight set in the object space and find the annular category over the weight set.
It was shown in \cite{GJ} that the annular representation categories  over any two full weight sets are equivalent.
Moreover, annular representations (in the sense of Vaughan Jones) of a subfactor $ N\subset M $  are the same as the annular representations of the $ N$-$N $-bimodule category $ \mcal C_{NN} $ generated by $ {}_N L^2 (M) {}_N $.

For the diagonal subfactor, $ \mcal C_{NN} $ is a pointed category, that is, the category of group graded vector spaces with a possibly nontrivial associator; the group is the one generated by the automorphisms used to build the diagonal subfactor and the associator is given by the $ 3 $-cocycle obstruction.
When the cocycle is trivial, the annular representations were discussed in \cite{GJ}.
We consider the annular algebra over the irreducible bimodules, that is, Ocneanu's tube algebra.
We show that the tube algebra is a direct sum over conjugacy classes of $ * $-algebras consisting of a matrix algebra tensored with the group algebra of the centralizer subgroup twisted by a $ 2 $-cocycle.
We give the explicit dependence of the $ 2 $-cocycle on the $ 3 $-cocycle obstruction. As a result, the annular representation decomposes as (possibly infinite) direct sum of projective representations of the centralizer subgroups corresponding to the conjugacy classes.

In the Bisch-Haagerup case, we consider the intermediate subfactor $ N \subset Q \subset M $ where $ N= Q^H $ and $ M = Q \rtimes K $ with $H$, $K$ being finite groups acting outerly on the $II_1$ factor $Q$.
The category of $ Q$-$Q $-bimodules $ \mcal C_{QQ} $ generated by $ {}_Q L^2(Q) \us N \otimes L^2(Q) {}_Q  $ and $ {}_Q L^2(M) {}_Q  $, is again a pointed category equivalent to the category of $ G $-graded vector spaces where $ G $ is the group generated by $ H $ and $ K $ in $ \t{Out} (Q) $ with the associator given by the $ 3 $-cocycle obstruction.
This category has special algebra objects, namely, $ A = \us {h \in H} \bigoplus {}_Q L^2(Q_h) {}_Q $ and $ B = \us {k \in K} \bigoplus {}_Q L^2(Q_k) {}_Q $.
Now, the $ 2 $-category of bimodules over $ N $ and $ M $ can be made equivalent to the $ 2 $-category of bimodules in $ \mcal C_{QQ} $ over $ A $ and $ B $.
This was a method suggested to us by Scott Morrison.
However, we obtain the annular representations straight from the actual bifinite $ N$-$N $-bimodules using techniques in \cite{GJ}.
$ \mcal C_{NN} $ unfortunately is not pointed anymore.
The set of isomorphism classes of irreducibles turns out to be complicated.
So, we consider a different weight set, namely $ {}_N L^2(Q_g) {}_N  $ for $ g\in G $ and obtain the annular algebra over it.
As a $ * $-algebra, it turns out to be same as before, namely direct sum over conjugacy classes of matrix algebras tensored with the group algebra of the centralizer subgroup twisted by a $ 2 $-cocycle. Thereby, the representations are also graded by the conjugacy classes and in each grade the representations are the same as that of the corresponding centralizer subgroup twisted by the $ 2 $-cocyle.
