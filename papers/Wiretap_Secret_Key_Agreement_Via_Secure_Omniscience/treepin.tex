 A source $\RZ_V$ is said to be \emph{tree-PIN} if there exists a tree $T=(V,E,\xi)$ and for each edge $e \in E$, there is a non-negative integer $n_e$ and a random vector $\RY_e = \left( \RX_{e,1}, \ldots, \RX_{e,n_e} \right)$. We assume that the collection of random variables $\RX :=(\RX_{e,k}: e\in E, k \in [n_e])$ are i.i.d. and each component is  uniformly distributed over a finite field, say $\Fq$. For $i \in V$,
 \begin{align*}
  \RZ_i = \left( \RY_e : i \in \xi (e) \right).
 \end{align*} 

 The linear wiretapper's side information $\RZ_{\opw}$ is defined as 
\begin{align*}
 \RZ_{\opw} = \RX \MW,
\end{align*}
where $\RX$ is a $1 \times (\sum_{e \in E}n_e)$ vector and $\MW$ is a $(\sum_{e \in E}n_e) \times n_w$ full column-rank matrix over $\Fq$. We sometimes refer to $\RX$ as the base vector. We refer to the pair $(\RZ_V, \RZ_{\opw})$ defined as above as a \emph{tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper}. This is a special case of an FLS. 

\begin{example}
Consider the tree $T$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:tree_pin_def} defined on  $V=\{1, \ldots,5\}$ with $E=\{a,b,c,d\}$. Let $\RY_a = (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2})$, $\RY_b = \RX_{b1}$, $\RY_c =\RX_{c1}$, and $\RY_d =\RX_{d1}$, where the base vector $\RX= (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2}, \RX_{b1}, \RX_{c1}, \RX_{d1})$ is uniformly distributed over $\mathbb{F}_2^5$. The corresponding source $\RZ_V$ is given by
\begin{gather*}
   \RZ_1= (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2}), \quad \RZ_2= (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2}, \RX_{b1}, \RX_{c1}), \quad \RZ_3=\RX_{c1}\\
    \RZ_4= (\RX_{b1}, \RX_{d1}), \quad \RZ_5= \RX_{d1}.
\end{gather*}

        \caption{Tree $T$ corresponding to a tree-PIN model}\label{fig:tree_pin_def}
\end{figure}
The observations of a wiretapper are $\RZ_{\opw}=(\RX_{a1}+\RX_{a2}, \RX_{a2}+\RX_{b1}+\RX_{d1})$.
This source $(\RZ_V, \RZ_{\opw})$ is an example of a tree-PIN source with a linear wiretapper. This is a special case of an FLS, as we can express it as $\bM \RZ_1 & \cdots& \RZ_m & \RZ_{\opw}\eM=\RX \bM \MM_1\;\cdots\;\MM_m \; \MW \eM$ for some matrices $\MM_1,\dots, \MM_m, \MW$. For example, we can write  $$\RZ_2= (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2}, \RX_{b1}, \RX_{c1})=\RX \underbrace{\bM 1&0&0&0\\0 & 1&0&0\\ 0 & 0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\\ 0 & 0&0&0 \eM}_{\MM_2},$$ 
$$\RZ_{\opw}=(\RX_{a1}+\RX_{a2}, \RX_{a2}+\RX_{b1}+\RX_{d1})=\RX \underbrace{\bM 1&0\\1 & 1\\ 0 & 1\\0&0\\ 0 & 1 \eM}_{\MW}.$$
\end{example}

\subsection{Motivating example} The following example of a tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper appeared in our earlier work \cite{chan20secure}, where we constructed an optimal secure omniscience scheme. Let $V=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and  
     \begin{align}
        \RZ_{\opw} &= \RX_a+\RX_b+\RX_c, \\
        \RZ_1 &= \RX_a, \; \RZ_2 = (\RX_a, \RX_b),\; \RZ_3 = (\RX_b, \RX_c),\; \RZ_4 =  \RX_c,
      \end{align}
  where $\RX_a$, $\RX_b$ and $\RX_c$ are uniformly random and independent bits. The tree here is a path of  length $3$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:exampletree}) and the wiretapper observes a linear combination of all the edge random variables. For secure omniscience, terminals 2 and 3, using $n=2$ i.i.d. realizations of the source, communicate linear combinations of their observations. The communication is of the form $\RF^{(2)} =(\tRF_2^{(2)},\tRF_3^{(2)})$, where  $\tRF_2^{(2)} =\RX^2_a+\MM \RX^2_b$ and $\tRF_3^{(2)}=(\MM + \MI) \RX_b^2 +\RX_c^2$ with $\MM:=\bM 1 & 1\\ 1 & 0\eM$.  Since the matrices $\MM$ and $\MM+\MI$ are invertible, all the terminals can recover $\RZ_V^2$ using this communication. For example, user 1 can first  recover $\RX_b^2$ from $(\RX_a^2, \tRF_2^{(2)})$ as $\RX_b^2 = (\MM+\MI)(\RX_a^2+ \tRF_2^{(2)})$, then $\RX_b^2$ can be used along with $\tRF_3^{(2)}$ to recover $\RX_c^2$ as $\RX_c^2 = (\MM+\MI)\RX_b^2+ \tRF_3^{(2)}$.  More interestingly, this communication is ``aligned" with the eavesdropper's observations, since $\RZ^2_{\opw} = \tRF_2^{(2)}+\tRF_3^{(2)}$. This scheme achieves $R_L$, which is 1 bit. 
  
  For minimizing leakage, this kind of alignment must happen. For example, if $\RZ^2_{\opw}$ were not contained in the span of $\tRF_2^{(2)}$ and $\tRF_3^{(2)}$, then the wiretapper could infer a lot more from the communication.  Ideally, if one wants zero leakage, then $\RF^{(n)}$ must be within the span of $\RZ^n_{\opw}$, which is not feasible in many cases because, with that condition, the communication might not achieve omniscience in the first place. Therefore keeping this in mind, it is reasonable to assume that there can be components of $\RF^{(n)}$ outside the span of $\RZ^n_{\opw}$. But we look for communication schemes that span as much of $\RZ_{\opw}$ as possible. Such an alignment condition is used to control the leakage. In this particular example, it turned out that an omniscience communication that achieves $\rco$ can be made to align with the wiretapper side information completely, i.e., $H(\RZ^n_{\opw}|\RF^{(n)})=0$.  Motivated by this example, we show that it is always possible for some omniscience communication to achieve complete alignment with the wiretapper's observations within the class of tree-PIN sources with linear wiretapper.
  
  
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cwsk:red} 
For a tree-PIN source $\RZ_V$ with linear wiretapper observing $\RZ_{\opw}$,
\begin{align*}
\wskc &= \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e|\op{mcf}(\RY_e,\RZ_{\opw})),  \\ 
\rl &=\left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e -n_w\right)\log_2q -\wskc \text{ bits}.
\end{align*}
In fact, a linear non-interactive scheme  is  sufficient to achieve both $\wskc$ and $\rl$ simultaneously.
\end{theorem}

% The above theorem shows that the intrinsic upper bound on $\wskc$ holds with equality. In the multiterminal setting, the intrinsic bound that follows from \cite[Theorem 4]{csiszar04} is given by 
% \begin{align*}
%  \wskc(\RZ_V \|\RZ_{\opw}) \leq \min_{\RJ-\RZ_{\opw}-\RZ_V}\pkc(\RZ_V|\RJ).
% \end{align*}
%  This is analogous to the intrinsic bound for the two-terminal case \cite{maurer99intrinsic}. 
% For the class of tree-PIN sources with linear wiretapper,  when $\RJ^*= \left( \op{mcf}(\RY_e,\RZ_{\opw}) \right)_{e \in E}$, it can be shown that  $\pkc(\RZ_V|\RJ^*)= \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e|\op{mcf}(\RY_e,\RZ_{\opw})) $. This can be derived using the characterization  in \cite{csiszar04} of the conditional minimum rate of communication for omniscience, $\rco(\RZ_V|\RJ^*)$. In fact, the same derivation can also be found in \cite{alireza19} for a  $\RJ$ that is obtained by passing the edge random variables through independent channels. In particular, $\RJ^{*}$ is a function of edge random variables $(\RY_e)_{e \in E}$ because $\op{mcf}(\RY_e, \RZ_{\opw})$ is a function of $\RY_e$. Therefore, we can see that $\pkc(\RZ_V|\RJ^*)$, which is an upper bound on $ \min_{\RJ-\RZ_{\opw}-\RZ_V}\pkc(\RZ_V|\RJ)$, matches with the $\wskc$ obtained from Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:red}.

 The theorem guarantees that we can achieve the wiretap secret key capacity in the tree-PIN case with linear wiretapper through a linear secure omniscience scheme, which establishes the duality between the two problems. This illustrates that omniscience can be helpful even beyond the case when there is no wiretapper side information.

 Our proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:red} is through a reduction to the particular subclass of \emph{irreducible} sources, which we defined next.
 
\begin{definition} \label{def:irreducible}
 A tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper is said to be \emph{irreducible} if $\op{mcf}(\RY_e, \RZ_{\opw}) $ is a constant function for every edge $e \in E$ .
\end{definition}

Whenever there is an edge $e$ such that $\RG_e:=\op{mcf}(\RY_e, \RZ_{\opw}) $ is a non-constant function, the user corresponding to a vertex incident on $e$ can reveal $\RG_e$ to the other users. This communication does not leak any additional information to the wiretapper because $\RG_e$ is a function of $\RZ_{\opw}$. Intuitively, for further communication, $\RG_e$ is not useful and hence can be removed from the source. After the reduction, the m.c.f. corresponding to $e$ becomes a constant function. In fact, we can carry out the reduction until the source becomes irreducible. This idea of reduction is illustrated in the following example.

\begin{Example}
Let us consider a source $\RZ_V$ defined on a path of length 3, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exampletree}. Let $\RY_a = (\RX_{a1}, \RX_{a2})$, $\RY_b = \RX_{b1}$ and $\RY_c =\RX_{c1}$, where $\RX_{a1}$, $\RX_{a2}$, $\RX_{b1}$ and $\RX_{c1}$ are uniformly random and independent bits. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\resizebox{\width}{1cm}{\input{Figures/example.tikz}}
\caption{A path of length 3}
\label{fig:exampletree}
 \end{figure}
 If $\RZ_{\opw}=\RX_{b1}+\RX_{c1}$, then the source is irreducible because $\op{mcf}(\RY_e, \RZ_{\opw})$ is a constant function for all $e \in \{a,b,c\}$. 
 
 However if  $\RZ_{\opw}=(\RX_{a1}+\RX_{a2},  \RX_{b1}+\RX_{c1})$, then the source is not irreducible, as $\op{mcf}(\RY_a, \RZ_{\opw}) =\RX_{a1}+\RX_{a2}$, which is a non-constant function. An equivalent representation of the source is
 $\RY_a = (\RX_{a1}, \RG_{a})$, $\RY_b = \RX_{b1}$, $\RY_c =\RX_{c1}$ and $\RZ_{\opw}=(\RG_{a}, \RX_{b1}+\RX_{c1})$, where $\RG_{a}=\RX_{a1}+\RX_{a2}$, which is also a uniform bit independent of $(\RX_{a1}, \RX_{b1}, \RX_{c1})$. So, for omniscience, user 2 initially can reveal $\RG_{a}$ without affecting the information leakage as it is completely aligned to $\RZ_{\opw}$. Since everyone has $\RG_a$, users can just communicate according to the omniscience scheme corresponding to the source without $\RG_a$. Note that this new source is irreducible.
\end{Example}

The next lemma shows that the kind of reduction to an irreducible source used in the above example is indeed optimal in terms of $R_L$ and $\wskc$ for all tree-PIN sources with linear wiretapper.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:irred} 
 If a tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper $(\RZ_V,\RZ_{\opw})$ is not irreducible then there exists an irreducible source $(\tRZ_V, \tRZ_{\opw})$ such that 
 \begin{align*}
\wskc(\RZ_V\| \RZ_{\opw}) = \wskc(\tRZ_V\|\tRZ_{\opw}),\\ \rl(\RZ_V\|\RZ_{\opw}) = \rl(\tRZ_V\|\tRZ_{\opw}),\\
H(\RY_e|\op{mcf}(\RY_e,\RZ_{\opw})) = H(\tRY_e)
\end{align*}
for all $e \in E$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
See Appendix~\ref{lem:proof:irred}.
\end{proof}
Note that, in the above lemma, the scheme that achieves $\rl(\RZ_V\|\RZ_{\opw})$  involves revealing the reduced m.c.f. components first and then communicating according to the scheme that achieves $\rl(\tRZ_V\|\tRZ_{\opw})$. As a consequence of Lemma~\ref{lem:irred}, to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:red}, it suffices to consider only irreducible sources. For ease of reference, we re-state the theorem for irreducible sources below.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cwsk:irred} 
If a tree-PIN source $\RZ_V$ with linear wiretapper $\RZ_{\opw}$ is irreducible then 
\begin{align*}
\wskc &= \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e)=\skc, \\
\rl &=\left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e -n_w\right)\log_2q- \wskc\text{ bits},
\end{align*}
where $\skc$ is the secret key capacity of Tree-PIN source without the wiretapper side information~\cite{csiszar04}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{IEEEproof}[Proof outline]
The main component of the proof is the achievability part, which involves a construction of an omniscience scheme with leakage rate $ \left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e -n_w\right)\log_2q - \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e)$. Since $\wskc$ is upper bounded by $\skc = \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e)$, we have $ \rl \leq \left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e -n_w\right)\log_2q - \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e) \leq \left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e -n_w\right)\log_2q- \wskc$.  This upper bound, together with the $\rl$ lower bound in Theorem~\ref{thm:RL:lb}, proves the theorem.

In the construction of this scheme, we start by assuming a certain linear structure for the communication $\RF^{(n)}$, with the coefficients of the linear combinations involved in the communication taken to be variables (termed ``communication coefficients'') whose values need to be determined. We then argue that the desired leakage rate can be achieved if we additionally impose two conditions on $\RF^{(n)}$, namely, perfect omniscience and perfect alignment. These conditions translate to certain linear-algebraic constraints on the communication coefficients in $\RF^{(n)}$. So it is enough to find an $\RF^{(n)}$ with its communication coefficients satisfying these constraints. To that end, we use the probabilistic method to argue that if the blocklength $n$ of the source is large enough, then there indeed exists such a realization of $\RF^{(n)}$. 

For clarity of exposition, we first execute this proof in the case of tree-PIN sources in which the underlying tree is a simple path, before generalizing it to the case of trees. The details are given in Appendix~\ref{thm:proof:cwsk:irred}.
\end{IEEEproof}

% \begin{proof}
% See Appendix~\ref{thm:proof:cwsk:irred}.
% \end{proof}

Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:irred} shows that, for irreducible sources, even when the wiretapper has side information, the users can still extract a key at rate $\skc$. In terms of secret key generation, the users are not really at a disadvantage if the wiretapper has linear observations.

\subsection{Constrained wiretap secret key capacity of tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper}
Secure omniscience in fact plays a role even in achieving the constrained wiretap secret key capacity of tree-PIN source with linear wiretapper. The constrained wiretap secret key capacity, denoted by $\wskc(R)$, is defined as in \eqref{eq:wskc} but with the supremum over all SKA schemes with $\limsup\frac{1}{n}\log|\mc{F}^{(n)}|<R$ where $\mc{F}^{(n)}$ is the alphabet of $\RF^{(n)}$. The following theorem gives a single-letter expression for the constrained wiretap secret key capacity, whose form is reminiscent of the constrained secret key capacity, \cite[Theorem~4.2]{chan19}. The proof involves a construction of a secure omniscience communication scheme for a part of the source.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:rateconstrained_treepin}
Given a tree-PIN source $\RZ_V$ with a linear wiretapper $\RZ_{\opw}$, we have
\begin{align*}
\wskc(R) = \min \left\{\frac{R}{|E|-1}, \wskc\right\},
\end{align*}
where $R$ is the total discussion rate and $\wskc =\min_{e \in E}H(Y_e|\op{mcf}(Y_e,Z_{\opw}))$, which is the unconstrained wiretap secret key capacity.
\end{theorem}


\begin{IEEEproof}[Proof outline]
As in Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:red}, this proof is also divided into two parts. In the first part, which is 
Theorem~\ref{lem:irred:rate}, we argue that removing an edge random variable that is also available with the wiretapper does not affect the constrained wiretap secret key capacity $\wskc(R)$. The argument involves showing that any valid SKA scheme on the original model can be converted into a valid SKA scheme on the reduced model, and vice versa.

In the second part, which is Theorem~\ref{thm:rate:irreducible}, we prove the statement of Theorem~\ref{thm:rateconstrained_treepin} for irreducible sources. The converse part follows from the constrained secret key capacity result in the case of tree-PIN sources without wiretapper side information, \cite[Theorem~4.2]{chan19}. The achievability part pivots on the argument that the rate pair $((|E|-1)\wskc,\wskc)$, where $\wskc=\min_{e \in E}H(Y_e)$, is achievable, as the rest of the curve follows from a time sharing argument.
% Note that, in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:irred}, we showed that the key rate $\min_{e \in E}H(Y_e)$ is achievable using a  communication of rate $\left(\sum_{e \in E}n_e\right) \log_2q  - \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e) \geq (|E|-1) \min_{e \in E} H(\RY_e)$. 
To show the achievability of this rate pair, we ignore some of the edge components of the source $(\RZ_V, \RZ_{\opw})$ to obtain a new source $(\RZ'_V, \RZ'_{\opw})$, which will be used for the purpose of secret key generation. In fact, we retain only $s=\min_{e \in E}n_e$ components for each edge. We then argue that for the new source $(\RZ'_V, \RZ'_{\opw})$, we can generate a key of rate $\wskc$ with a communication of rate $(|E|-1)\wskc$, if we use the key generation scheme used in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:cwsk:irred}.

Theorem~\ref{thm:rateconstrained_treepin} follows from combining both these parts. The complete details are given in Appendix~\ref{app:thm:proof_rateconstrained_treepin}.
