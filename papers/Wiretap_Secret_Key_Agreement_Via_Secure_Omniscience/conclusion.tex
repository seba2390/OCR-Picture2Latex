For a tree-PIN model with linear wiretapper, we have characterized $\rl$ and $\wskc$. It is worth noting that since the evaluation of the lower bound on $\wskc$ given in \cite[Th. 7]{aminsource} is not explicit, the optimality of the bound is not very clear. But we showed an even stronger result for our particular model that a linear secure omniscience scheme achieves $\wskc$, which establishes the duality between the two problems. So, our result gives evidence for the conjecture that, for FLSs, secure omniscience achieves $\wskc$. However, proving this even for a general PIN model turned out to be quite challenging. Another interesting part of the proof is the communication scheme that achieves perfect omniscience and perfect alignment with the wiretapper. Though we used a random coding approach in the proof, there is an explicit optimal protocol construction in the case $n_e=1$ for all $e \in E$ \cite[Sec. V]{treepin21arxiv}. Such deterministic protocols, which have potential application in the CCDE context, are not known in the general tree-PIN case.
