\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduce a new model for scene graph generation -- Graph R-CNN. Our model includes a relation proposal network (RePN) that efficiently and intelligently prunes out pairs of objects that are unlikely to be related, and an attentional graph convolutational network (aGCN) that effectively propagates contextual information across the graph. We also introdce a novel scene graph generation evaluation metric (\texttt{SGGen+}) that is more fine-grained and realistic than existing metrics. Our approach outperforms existing methods for scene graph generation, as evaluated using existing metrics and our proposed metric.
