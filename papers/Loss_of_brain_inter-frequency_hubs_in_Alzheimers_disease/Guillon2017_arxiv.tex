\section{Conclusions}
%% Final Conclusion

We proposed a multi-layer network approach to characterize multi-frequency brain networks in Alzheimer's disease.
The obtained results gave new insights into the neural deterioration of Alzheimer's disease by revealing an abnormal loss of inter-frequency centrality in memory-related association areas as well as in the cingulate cortex.
Longitudinal studies, including prodromal mild cognitive impairment subjects, will need to assess the predictive value of this new information as a potential non-invasive biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases.
