\textbf{Organization.}
The Appendix is organized as follows. In Appendix \ref{appendix:societal_impacts}, we discuss the societal impact associated with our work. In Appendix \ref{appendix:mrc}, we focus on $\MRC$ and provide the proofs of Theorem \ref{theorem:mrc_accuracy_local}, Theorem \ref{theorem:mrc_pure_privacy}, and Theorem \ref{theorem:mrc_approximate_privacy}. In Appendix \ref{appendix:mmrc}, we focus on $\MMRC$ and provide the proofs of Theorem \ref{theorem:mmrc_privacy} and Theorem \ref{theorem:mmrc_accuracy_local_wrt_mrc}. Further, we also provide Theorem \ref{theorem:mmrc_accuracy_local} where we show that $\MMRC$ can simulate any $\varepsilon$-LDP cap-based mechanism in a nearly lossless fashion with about $\varepsilon$ bits of communication. In Appendix \ref{appendix:privunit}, we provide additional preliminary on $\PrivUnit$ and also show that $\PrivUnit$ is a cap-based mechanism (Definition \ref{def:cap}). In Appendix \ref{appendix:mrc_pu}, we show how $\PrivUnit$ can be simulated using $\MRC$ analogous to how we simulated $\PrivUnit$ using $\MMRC$ in Section \ref{sec:mean_estimation}. Along with the theoretical guarantees, we also provide some empirical comparisons between $\MRC$ simulating $\PrivUnit$ and $\PrivUnit$. In Appendix \ref{appendix:mmrc_pu}, we provide the proofs of Lemma \ref{lemma:mmrc_privunit_bias} and Theorem \ref{thm:me_mmrc_pu} as well as some additional empirical comparisons between $\MMRC$ simulating $\PrivUnit$ and $\PrivUnit$.
In Appendix \ref{appendix:ss}, we provide additional preliminary on $\SubsetSelection$ and also show that $\SubsetSelection$ is a cap-based mechanism (Definition \ref{def:cap}). 
In Appendix \ref{appendix:mrc_ss}, we show how $\SubsetSelection$ can be simulated using $\MRC$ analogous to how we simulated $\SubsetSelection$ using $\MMRC$ in Section \ref{sec:frequency_estimation}. Along with the theoretical guarantees, we also provide some empirical comparisons between $\MRC$ simulating $\SubsetSelection$ and $\SubsetSelection$. 
In Appendix \ref{sec:mmrc_ss_app}, we provide the proofs of Lemma \ref{lemma:mmrc_ss_bias} and Theorem \ref{thm:fe_mmrc_ss} as well as some additional empirical comparisons between $\MMRC$ simulating $\SubsetSelection$ and $\SubsetSelection$.
