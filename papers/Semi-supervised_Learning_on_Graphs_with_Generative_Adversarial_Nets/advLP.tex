\section{Theoretical Basis}\label{sec:theory}
We provide theoretical analyses on why GANs can help semi-supervised learning on graph. In section \ref{sec:mot}, we claim that the working principle is to reduce the influence of labeled nodes across density gaps. In view of the difficulty to directly analyze the dynamics in training of deep neural networks,  
we base the analysis on the graph Laplacian regularization framework.
