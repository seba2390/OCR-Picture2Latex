\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

In this paper, we describe our experience of implementing \textit{Story Forest}, a news content organization system at Tencent, which is designed to discover events from vast streams of trending and breaking news and organize events in sensible story trees in an online manner. Our system is specifically tailored for fast processing massive amounts of breaking news data, whose story structures can most likely be captured by either a tree, a timeline or a flat structure.
We propose a two-layer graph-based document clustering algorithm to extract fine-grained events from vast long documents.
Our system further organizes the events into story trees with efficient online algorithms upon the arrival of daily news data. 
We conducted extensive performance evaluation based on 60 GB of real-world (Chinese) news data, although our ideas are not language-dependent and can easily be extended to other languages, through detailed pilot user experience studies.

Extensive results suggest that our clustering procedure is significantly more effective at accurate event extraction than existing algorithms. 
83\% of the event links generated by Story Forest are logically correct as compared to an accuracy of 33\% generated by more complex story graphs, demonstrating the ability of our system to organize trending news events into a logical structure that appeals to human readers.
% The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed Story Forest in terms of accurately identifying events and organizing hot events from recent trending news articles into a logical structure that is intuitively appealing to human readers, compared to multiple existing algorithm frameworks.
