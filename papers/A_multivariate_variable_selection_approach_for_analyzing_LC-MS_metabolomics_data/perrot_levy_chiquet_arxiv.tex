\begin{abstract} Omic data are characterized by the
    presence of  strong dependence structures that  result either from
    data  acquisition or  from  some underlying  biological
    processes.   In metabolomics,  for  instance,  data resulting  from
    Liquid  Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry  (LC-MS)  -- a  technique
    which gives access  to a large coverage of  metabolites -- exhibit
    such  patterns.   These  data sets  are   typically  used  to  find  the
    metabolites characterizing a phenotype of interest associated with
    the samples. However, applying
    some  statistical  procedures that  do  not  adjust the variable selection
    step to  the dependence pattern may result  in a loss
    of power  and the selection  of spurious variables.  The  goal of
  this  paper is  to propose  a  variable selection  procedure in  the
  multivariate linear model that accounts for the dependence structure
  of  the multiple  outputs which may lead in the LC-MS framework to the selection
 of more relevant metabolites.
    We propose  a novel  Lasso-based approach  in the
  multivariate  framework  of the  general  linear  model taking  into
  account the dependence structure by  using various modelings of the
  covariance matrix  of the residuals. Our  numerical experiments show
  that  including  the estimation  of  the  covariance matrix  of  the
  residuals in the Lasso  criterion dramatically improves the variable
  selection performance. Our approach  is also successfully applied to
  a LC-MS data set made of African  copals samples for which it is able
  to provide a small list of metabolites without altering the
  phenotype discrimination.
   Our methodology is implemented in the R package \textsf{MultiVarSel}
which is available from the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

\section{Conclusion}

In  this paper,  we  proposed  a novel  approach  for analyzing  LC-MS
metabolomics data by introducing a new Lasso-type approach taking into
account the dependence that may exist  between the columns of the data
matrix.   Our approach  is  implemented in  the R  package \textsf{MultiVarSel}
which is available from the The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).   
In the course  of this study, we  have shown
that our method  has two main features. Firstly, it  is very efficient
from a statistical point of view  for selecting a restricted number of
stable metabolites   characterizing each level   of   the    factor   of
interest. Secondly,  its very low  computational burden makes  its use
possible on very large LC-MS metabolomics data.
