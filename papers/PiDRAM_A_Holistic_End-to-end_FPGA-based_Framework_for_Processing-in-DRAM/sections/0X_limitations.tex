%\todo{DRAM bandwidth issue.}
\atb{In \X's FPGA-based prototype, the rocket core is clocked at 50 MHz. We suffer from timing closure issues that prevent us from significantly increasing the clock rate of the rocket core. We set the clock rate of the DRAM interface to the minimum DDR3 clock frequency (800 MHz) specified in JEDEC's DDR3 standard~\cite{X}, in an effort to maximize the $core/DRAM$ clock frequency ratio to better model commercial systems. This discrepancy in the core and the DRAM clock frequencies results in small bandwidth utilization for (i) CPU accesses to DRAM (0.6\% of the available DDR3 bandwidth) and (ii) RowClone operations (1.2\% of the available RowClone bandwidth). We will augment the prototype to simulate a more realistic $core/DRAM$ clock frequency ratio as part of future work.}

%\X's FPGA-based prototype suffers from discrepancy between the DRAM transfer rate and the processor clock frequency that does not fully represent a contemporary system.
