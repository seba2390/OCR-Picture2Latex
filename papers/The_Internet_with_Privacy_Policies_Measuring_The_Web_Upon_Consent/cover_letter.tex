Dear Ryen White, 

\vspace{1cm}
\noindent
Please, find enclosed our proposed contribution to ACM Transactions on the Web entitled ``The Internet with Privacy Policies: Measuring The Web Upon Consent''. A pre-print version of our manuscript is available on the ArXiv repository.\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00395}}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
In this paper, we present Priv-Accept, a Web crawler able to accept the privacy policies on websites and use it to run an extensive measurement campaign.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent
As a consequence of recent privacy regulations (GDPR among all), websites started showing more and more consent management modules – i.e., Privacy Banners – the visitors have to interact with to access the website content. They challenge the automatic collection of measurements as well as the understanding of the Web since they prevent crawlers from observing the actual website content.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent
We use Priv-Accept to run a thorough measurement campaign focusing on popular websites in Europe and the US, visiting both landing and internal pages from different countries around the world. Our results show that all measurements performed not dealing with the Privacy Banners offer a very biased and partial view of the Web. After accepting the privacy policies, web tracking is abundantly more pervasive, and webpages are larger and slower.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\noindent
We have no conflict with any Associate Editor, and we recommend the following three Editors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polly Huang and Michael Rabinovich as experts in Web Measurements.
    \item Anna Cinzia Squicciarini as expert in User Privacy.
\end{itemize}

Thank you in advance for considering our work. We are looking forward to receiving your feedback.

Best regards,\\
