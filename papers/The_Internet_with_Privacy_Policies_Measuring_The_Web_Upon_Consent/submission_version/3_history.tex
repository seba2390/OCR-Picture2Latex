\section{Background and related work}
\label{sec:history}

Content providers on the Web (websites, social networks, etc.) often monetize the content they offer using advertisements. To increase their effectiveness, the so-called behavioral advertisement leverages users' interests to provide targeted ads. This is possible thanks to Web trackers, i.e., third-party services embedded in the webpages that gather users' browsing history. Trackers are nowadays largely present on websites and reach the majority of internauts~\cite{metwalley2015online,pujol2015annoyed}. Trackers exploit cookies and advanced techniques to enable the collection of personal information~\cite{acar2014web,rizzo2021unveiling,papadogiannakis2021user}.

%In parallel, many solutions exist for blocking trackers and ads, typically implemented via browser plugins (e.g., AdBlock Plus~\cite{adblock}, Ghostery~\cite{ghostery} or Disconnect~\cite{disconnect}). Their effectiveness has been testified in several studies~\cite{pujol2015annoyed, traverso2017benchmark, mazel2019comparison}, and none of them offers complete protection.

\subsection{The Role of Legislators}

In this tangled picture, legislators started to regulate the ecosystem to avoid massive indiscriminate tracking that may threaten users' privacy. The first attempt has been the European Cookie Law~\cite{directive2009} entered into force in 2013, which mandates websites to ask for informed consent before using any profiling technology. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)~\cite{gpdr} entered into force in all European member states. It is an extensive regulation on privacy, aiming at protecting users' privacy by imposing strict rules when handling personal information. Unlike previous regulations, it sets severe fines and infringements that could result in a fine of up to â‚¬10 million, or 2\% of the firm's worldwide annual revenue, whichever amount is higher. Some websites have already been caught to present legal violations in their Cookie Banner implementation~\cite{matte2020cookie} and a large fraction have been shown to use tracking technologies before users consent~\cite{trevisan20194, sanchez2019can}. In the US, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)~\cite{ccpa} similarly enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for California residents by requiring businesses to give consumers notices about their privacy practices.

As a result, most of the websites now provide explicit Privacy Banners~\cite{degeling2018we} and many adopt Consent Management toolsets~\cite{hills2020consent}, making the website content difficult to access until visitors accept the privacy policy. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:cookie_accept_example} shows the same news website homepage before and after accepting the privacy policy. Only upon pressing the ``Got it'' button, the website content is fully visible.
%In some cases, websites use more persistent and sophisticated forms of tracking in order to track users who denied their acceptance of cookies~\cite{papadogiannakis2021user}.

\subsection{The Effect of Privacy Banners on Web Measurements}

Despite cases of misuse, the new regulations had a large impact on the internauts, and this complicates the measurement of the tracking ecosystem. A simple Web crawler visiting the websites without accepting the privacy policies would offer a biased picture, with no trackers and no ads being loaded.  Hu~\emph{et al.}~\cite{hu2019characterising} already found that the number of third-parties dropped by more than 10\% after GDPR when visiting websites automatically. Conversely, when using a dataset from 15 real users, they measure no significant reduction in long-term numbers of third-party cookies. Dabrowski~\emph{et al.}~\cite{dabrowski2019measuring} draw similar conclusions, finding an apparent decrease in the use of persistent cookies from 2016 to 2018. Sorensen~\emph{et al.}~\cite{sorensen2019before} testify a decreasing trend in the number of third parties during 2018. We quantify this phenomenon in Figure~\ref{fig:ha_websites_trackers}, using the HTTPArchive open dataset~\cite{httparchive}. The curators of this dataset maintain a list of top websites worldwide that they automatically visit using the Google Chrome browser from a US-based server to store a copy of each visited webpage. Using the tracker list detailed in Section~\ref{sec:metho}, we report the percentage of websites embedding one or more trackers for 5 European countries (simply using the Top-Level Domain to identify the country). We restrict the analysis on those websites that exist for the whole six years-long periods ($9\,196$ website in total).

Figure~\ref{fig:ha_websites_trackers} apparently shows that the introduction of the GDPR (the black vertical line in May 2018) results in an abrupt decrease in the number of tracker-embedding websites, a trend that continues up to the moment we write. However, as we will show, these measurements are an artifact due to the GDPR itself. Indeed, the Web crawler used by HTTPArchive can only capture the behavior of the websites as a ``first-time visitor'', before the user accepts any privacy policy. The crawler thus misses cookies, third-party trackers, and any personalized ads.

Research papers that rely on crawling large portions of the Web for different reasons could be affected by the same bias in their measurements. For instance, this would challenge the automatic measurement of the Web ecosystem on privacy~\cite{acar2014web,falahrastegar2014rise,metwalley2015online,pujol2015annoyed,englehardt2016online,iordanou2018tracing,hu2019characterising,rizzo2021unveiling,vandrevu2019what,papadogiannakis2021user,aqeel2020on} and counter-measurements~\cite{pujol2015annoyed, traverso2017benchmark, mazel2019comparison}. Moreover, this will also impact those works that rely on crawlers and headless browsers~\cite{avasarala2014selenium} to quantify the impact in the wild of new technologies like SPDY,  HTTP/2~\cite{wang2014speedy,de2015http,bocchi2016measuring,erman2015towards}, 4G/5G~\cite{alay2017experience,asrese2019measuring}, accelerating proxies~\cite{sivakumar2014parcel,wang2016speeding,ruamviboonsuk2017vroom}, or generic benchmark solutions~\cite{netravali2015mahimahi}. At last, even spiders and mirroring tools like HTTPArchive may be affected if the website allows the visitor to access its content only after accepting the privacy policy.



\subsection{Related Work and Tools}

Authors of~\cite{vallina2019tales} are the first to consider the impact of the Privacy Banner presence. First, they instruct a custom OpenWPM crawler to identify specific Cookie Banners, and then they manually verify the results. Unfortunately, they solely focus on the pornographic ecosystem, which they acknowledge to be rather different from the Web at large, and thus their work can hardly be generalized.

Recently, authors of~\cite{aqeel2020on} demonstrated that it is fundamental to consider the complexity of the Web ecosystem and include internal pages in every measurement study. They find a number of recent works that neglect internal pages and, as such, might provide biased results. Yet, they ignore the implications of Privacy Banners. Here, we aim at providing an extensive and thorough study of their impact on the Web. Our goal is to enable the study of webpage characteristics as visitors would experience, assuming that most of them accept the default privacy setting as offered by the Privacy Banner. Indeed, it has been shown that users tend to ignore privacy-related notices~\cite{vila2003we, grossklags2007empirical, coventry2016personality}. Considering GDPR Privacy Banners, users tend to accept privacy policies when offered a default button via intrusive banners that nudge users ~\cite{CookieBenchmarkStudy,bauer2021you}, which is often the case~\cite{hausner2021dark} with websites offering large pop-ups or wall-style banners that cover most of the webpage as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cookie_accept_example}.

There exist solutions that aim at automatically managing Privacy Banners: some browser add-ons try to hide Privacy Banners using a list of CSS selectors of known Privacy Banners. The most popular add-ons of this kind are ``I don't care about cookies''~\cite{idontcare} and ``Remove Cookie Banners''~\cite{remove}. Unfortunately, hiding the Privacy Banners has an unpredictable behavior, in some cases falling back to privacy policies acceptance, while, in other cases, triggering an opt-out choice. Other proposals, again in the form of browser add-ons, try to explicitly opt-in or opt-out to cookies. For example, ``Ninja Cookie''~\cite{ninja} approves only cookies strictly needed to proceed on the website. Conversely, Autoconsent~\cite{autoconsent} and Consent-O-Matic~\cite{consentomatic} use a set of predefined rules to either opt-in or opt-out to cookies, according to the user configuration. These two are the most similar solutions to \TOOL, as they allow to automate the action of providing consent to privacy policies if used in combination with a crawler. However, they are based on a list of actions the browser has to automatically run when finding a set of popular Consent Management Providers (CMPs), limiting their effectiveness. In Section~\ref{sec:ca_vs_com}, we compare \TOOL with Consent-O-Matic -- the most mature tool -- showing that it accepts privacy policies on a much smaller portion of websites than \TOOL. Indeed, the diversity of the Web ecosystem, the presence of multiple languages and the fully customizable choice of cookie banner buttons make the engineering of \TOOL not trivial.
