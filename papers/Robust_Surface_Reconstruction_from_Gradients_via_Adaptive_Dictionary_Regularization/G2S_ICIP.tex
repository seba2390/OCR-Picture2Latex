\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces a novel approach to robust surface reconstruction from photometric stereo normal vector maps that is particularly well-suited for reconstructing surfaces from noisy gradients. Specifically, we propose an adaptive dictionary learning based approach that attempts to simultaneously integrate the gradient fields while sparsely representing the spatial patches of the reconstructed surface in an adaptive dictionary domain. We show that our formulation learns the underlying structure of the surface, effectively acting as an adaptive regularizer that enforces a smoothness constraint on the reconstructed surface. Our method is general and may be coupled with many existing approaches in the literature to improve the integrity of the reconstructed surfaces. We demonstrate the performance of our method on synthetic data as well as real photometric stereo data and evaluate its robustness to noise.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we explored the use of adaptive dictionary learning based regularization for the estimation of surfaces from their gradient fields. We showed that our proposed dictionary learning approach is able to effectively reject the addition of noise to gradient fields/images and produce more accurate and smooth representations of the underlying surfaces compared to existing methods. Our dictionary learning framework is very general and would be straightforward to combine with many existing algorithms. In future work, we plan to investigate these combinations and perform a more thorough study of the influence of the various parameters of our dictionary learning model on the reconstructed surfaces.
