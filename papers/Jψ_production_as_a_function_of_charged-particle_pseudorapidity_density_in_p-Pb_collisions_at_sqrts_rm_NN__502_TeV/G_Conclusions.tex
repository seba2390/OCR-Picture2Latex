Measurements of the relative \jpsi yield and average transverse momentum as a function of the relative charged-particle pseudorapidity density in \ppb collisions at the LHC at $\snn = 5.02$ TeV have been presented in this letter.
The measurements were performed with ALICE in three ranges of rapidity. The charged-particle multiplicity was measured at mid-rapidity; multiplicities up to 4 times the value of NSD events were reached, corresponding to rare events of less than 1\% of the total hadronic interaction cross section.
An increase of the relative \jpsi yield with the relative multiplicity is observed, with a trend towards saturation at high multiplicity for the forward rapidity (proton-going direction). 
For the \jpsi data at mid-rapidity, a comparison to corresponding measurements of D-meson yields is performed, revealing similar patterns for the two meson species.
At forward and backward rapidities, the relative average transverse momenta exhibit a saturation above moderate values of relative multiplicity.

The present data are expected to constitute a stringent test for theoretical models of \jpsi production in \mbox{\ppb} collisions and help to understand the effects associated with the production of a deconfined medium in \pb collisions. 
%The measurements reported here may help to clarify whether such a medium is also produced in high-multiplicity \ppb collisions.
