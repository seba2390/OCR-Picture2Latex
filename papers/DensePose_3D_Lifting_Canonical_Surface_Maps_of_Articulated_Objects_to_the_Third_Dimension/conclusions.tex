\section{Conclusions}\label{s:conclusion}

We presented a method that learns 3D deformable shape reconstruction given only a single artist-generated rigid template mesh and dense 2D keypoint annotations,
without the need for 3D supervision with the deformable shape model or 3D pose regressor, which are difficult to obtain for most object categories.
Because of this, we apply DP3D to the reconstruct animals that lack such 3D annotations.
