\section{Proofs for Section 2}
We want to prove the following theorem.
\thmProdJohnsonGraph*
We need the following results for the proof.
\begin{theorem}[Cartesian product of $d$-regular graphs]
\label{thm:productgraphs_regular}
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $G_1, ..., G_n$ be undirected $d$-regular graphs. Then $G^n = \times_{i=1}^n G_i$ has $\prod_{i=1}^n |V_i|$ vertices and is $nd$-regular.
\end{theorem}
The proof of this theorem is immediate.
\begin{theorem}[Spectral gap of product graphs]
\label{thm:spectralgap_productgraphs}
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be $d_1$- resp. $d_2$-regular graphs with eigenvalues of the associated Markov chain $1 = \lambda_1 \geq~...~\geq \lambda_{k_1}$ resp. $1 = \mu_1 \geq~...~ \geq \mu_{k_2}$.
Denote by $\delta_i$ the spectral gap of $G_i$, $i=1,2$.\\
Then the spectral gap $\delta$ of the product graph $G_1 \times G_2$ fulfils:
$$\delta \geq \frac{\min\left(\delta_2d_2, \delta_1d_1\right)}{d_1 + d_2}$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We first recall the following result (see \cite{CDS80}, Chapter 2, Section 5, Theorems 2.23 and 2.24):\\
The Markov chain associated to the graph $G_1 \times G_2$ has $k_1k_2$ eigenvalues which are $\nu_{i,j} = \frac{d_1\lambda_i + d_2\mu_j}{d_1 + d_2}$. In particular, $\delta = \frac{d_1 + d_2 - \max_{(i,j) \not = (1,1)}|d_1\lambda_i  + d_2\mu_j|}{d_1 + d_2}$.\\
As the eigenvalues of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are ordered from largest to smallest, we have the following:
$$\max_{i=2,...,k_1}|\lambda_i| = \max(\lambda_2,-\lambda_{k_1})$$
$$\max_{j=2,...,k_2}|\mu_i| = \max(\mu_2,-\mu_{k_2})$$
Furthermore
$$d_1\delta_1 = d_1 - d_1\max_{i=2,...,k_1}|\lambda_i| = d_1 - d_1\max(\lambda_2,-\lambda_{k_1}) \leq d_1 + d_1\lambda_{k_1}$$
$$d_2\delta_2 = d_2 - d_2\max_{j=2,...,k_2}|\mu_j| = d_2 - d_2\max(\mu_2,-\mu_{k_2}) \leq d_2 + d_2\mu_{k_2}$$
Which taken together entail\\
$$d_1 + d_2 + d_1\lambda_{k_1} + d_2\mu_{k_2} \geq d_1\delta_1 + d_2\delta_2$$
Moreover
\begin{align*}
  \max_{(i,j) \not = (1,1)}|d_1\lambda_i  + d_2\mu_j| &= \max\left(d_1\lambda_1 + d_2\mu_2, d_1\lambda_2 + d_2\mu_1, - d_1\lambda_{k_1} - d_2\mu_{k_2}\right)\\ 
  &= \max\left(d_1 + d_2\mu_2, d_1\lambda_2 + d_2, - d_1\lambda_{k_1} - d_2\mu_{k_2}\right)\\
\end{align*}
Therefore
$$(d_1 + d_2)\delta = d_1 + d_2 - \max_{(i,j) \not = (1,1)}|d_1\lambda_i  + d_2\mu_j| = \min\left(d_2 - d_2\mu_2, d_1 - d_1\lambda_2, d_1 + d_2 + d_1\lambda_{k_1} + d_2\mu_{k_2}\right)$$\\
Finally
\begin{align*}
  \delta &= \frac{d_1 + d_2 - \max_{(i,j) \not = (1,1)}|d_1\lambda_i  + d_2\mu_j|}{d_1 + d_2}\\
  &= \frac{\min\left(d_2 - d_2\mu_2, d_1 - d_1\lambda_2, d_1 + d_2 + d_1\lambda_{k_1} + d_2\mu_{k_2}\right)}{d_1 + d_2}\\
  &\geq \frac{\min\left(d_2 - d_2\max(\mu_2,-\mu_{k_2}), d_1 - d_1\max(\lambda_2,-\lambda_{k_1}), d_1\delta_1 + d_2\delta_2\right)}{d_1 + d_2}\\
  &\geq \frac{\min\left(\delta_2d_2, \delta_1d_1, d_1\delta_1 + d_2\delta_2\right)}{d_1 + d_2}\\
  &\geq \frac{\min\left(\delta_2d_2, \delta_1d_1\right)}{d_1 + d_2}
\end{align*}
$\qed$
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Theorem \ref{thm:product_johnsongraphs}]
  Point (1) is immediate by Theorem \ref{thm:productgraphs_regular}.\\
  Point (2) is proved using induction.\\
  Indeed, for $m=2$ we have, by Theorem \ref{thm:spectralgap_productgraphs} :
    $$\delta(J^2) \geq \frac{\delta(J)d}{2d} = \frac{1}{2}\delta(J)$$
  And for $m\geq2$, supposing that $\delta(J^m) \geq \frac{1}{m}\delta(J)$, we have, using Theorem \ref{thm:spectralgap_productgraphs} and point (1) of this theorem :
    \begin{align*}
      \delta(J^{m+1}) &\geq \frac{\min\left(md\delta(J^m),d\delta(J)\right)}{md + d}\\
      &\geq \frac{\min\left(\frac{md}{m}\delta(J),d\delta(J)\right)}{md + d}\\
      &\geq \frac{1}{m+1}\delta(J)
    \end{align*}
Point (3) just follows from the fact that $J^m(n,r)$ is regular, undirected, connected and has positive spectral gap by using the previous point.
    $\qed$
