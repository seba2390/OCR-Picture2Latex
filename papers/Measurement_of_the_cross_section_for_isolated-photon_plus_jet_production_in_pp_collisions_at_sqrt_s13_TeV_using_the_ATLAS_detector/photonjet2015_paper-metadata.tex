\AtlasAbstract{
The dynamics of isolated-photon production in association with a jet
in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13$~\TeV\
are studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a dataset with an
integrated luminosity of $3.2$~fb$^{-1}$. Photons are required to have
transverse energies above $125$~\GeV. Jets are identified using the
anti-$k_t$ algorithm with radius parameter $R=0.4$ and required to
have transverse momenta above $100$~\GeV.  Measurements of
isolated-photon plus jet cross sections are presented as functions of
the leading-photon transverse energy, the leading-jet transverse
momentum, the azimuthal angular separation between the photon and the
jet, the photon--jet invariant mass and the scattering angle in the
photon--jet centre-of-mass system. Tree-level plus parton-shower
predictions from {\textsc{Sherpa}} and {\textsc{Pythia}} as well as
next-to-leading-order QCD predictions from {\textsc{Jetphox}} and
{\textsc{Sherpa}} are compared to the measurements.
