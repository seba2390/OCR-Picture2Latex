In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method for action recognition using instance segmentation.
Although many data augmentation methods have been proposed for image recognition, few of them are tailored for action recognition.
Our proposed method, ObjectMix, extracts each object region from two videos using instance segmentation
and combines them to create new videos.
Experiments on two action recognition datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
and show its superiority over VideoMix, a prior work.
