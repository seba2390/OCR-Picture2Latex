\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented a new scalable backbone for low computational complexity image processing based on inverted residual blocks. The backbone was benchmarked on detection and tracking tasks with state-of-the-art results. We achieved ~20\% higher mAP with respect to EfficientNets and MobileNets on the COCO and VOC2012 detection benchmarks for the same computational complexity and ~80\% less parameters. Moreover, we achieved significantly higher MOTA score with the same compression factor.
The main asset of \textit{PhiNets} is that our model outperforms the hardware-constrained scaling by disjointly optimizing MACC, working memory and parameter memory as per the hardware-aware architecture scaling paradigm.

In conclusion, we proved that our approach successfully runs on a IoT endnode with a power consumption that allows the node to be powered using a solar panel.
