\section{Summary and conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have developed novel theoretical guarantees and algorithms for recovery of sparse or compressible signals where measurements have been polluted by high-magnitude corruptions. Our results are uniform theoretical recovery estimates for general linear systems where the measurement matrix satisfies a corruptions-based RIP-like condition. 

We have refined an existing regularized $\ell^1$ minimization algorithm into an iteratively reweighted $\ell^1$ minimization algorithm that shows superior performance for the examples that we have investigated. An application of these examples to recovery of polynomial Chaos expansions from model UQ problems illustrates that our algorithms are resistant to highly-corrupted measurement data that may result from hardware or software faults in modern large-scale parallel computing paradigms.

Empirical tests suggest that refinements of our algorithm is relatively stable with respect to the magnitude of the corruptions, but our theory is not applicable to these algorithmic refinements and some observed behavior (e.g., Remark \ref{rem:weights}) remains theoretically unexplained, which can be the subject of future explorations.
