\begin{abstract}
After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, particle physics has entered an exciting era. An important question is whether the Standard Model of particle physics correctly describes the scalar sector realized by nature, or whether it is part of a more extended model, featuring additional particle content. A prime way to test this is to probe models with extended scalar sectors at future collider facilities. We here discuss such models in the context of high-luminosity LHC, a possible proton-proton collider with 27 and 100 \TeV center-of-mass energy, as well as future lepton colliders with {various} center-of-mass energies.

\section{Introduction}
After the discovery of a scalar which complies with the properties of the Higgs boson {$h$} of the Standard Model {(SM)} {\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}}, particle physics has entered an exciting era. One important question is whether the particle discovered by the LHC experiments indeed corresponds to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model, or whether it is part of a model featuring an extended scalar sector. So far, both theoretical as experimental uncertainties allow for both options, although in general the parameter space of new physics models becomes increasingly constrained by
both direct searches as well as indirect probes, as e.g. the 125 \GeV~{scalar} coupling strength or electroweak precision observables {(see e.g. \cite{atlpub, cmspub} for recent results)}.

In this work, we will discuss the discovery prospects of models with extended scalar sectors at future collider facilities. We will concentrate on two different scenarios: {\sl (a)} The Inert Doublet Model, a two-Higgs-doublet model that features an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. This model introduces 5 additional particles in the so-called dark sector and provides a dark matter candidate. {\sl (b)} The two-real singlet extension of the Standard Model, where the scalar sector is enhanced by two real scalar singlets. In this model, {an} exact $\mathbb{Z}_2\,\otimes\,\mathbb{Z}_2'$ symmetry {is assumed, which} is {successively} broken by the vacuum expectation values { (vevs)} of the two additional scalar fields. {This} induces mixing between all CP-even scalar states. This model features a plethora of new physics channels which so far have not been investigated by the LHC experiments. We will briefly discuss these and subsequently focus on the discovery prospects for ${h}{h}{h}$ production within this model at LHC Run III as well as High-Luminosity LHC.

The two models described above will be covered in the subsequent sections of this manuscript.
Section \ref{sec:idm} will discuss the Inert Doublet Model, current status as well as possible future collider prospects. In section \ref{sec:2rs}, on the other hand, we will comment on the two-real-singlet extension, with a special focus on discovery prospects for the $hhh$ final state at the HL-LHC. We will conclude in section \ref{sec:concl}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

In this work, we have discussed several new physics models and their discovery prospects at future colliders. For the Inert Doublet Model, a two-Higgs doublet model with a dark matter candidate, we have discussed constraints on the parameter space and presented results of a dedicated study of several benchmark points in di-scalar production within the CLIC environment for several center-of-mass energies. We found that, when using both leptonic and semi-leptonic decay modes for these searches, mass scales up to 1 \TeV could in principle be reachable. Furthermore, we have performed a simplified study where we compared collider reaches for IDM benchmark points using a simple counting criterium. We found that, especially for the elusive $AA$ production channel, the inclusion of VBF-type production modes greatly enhances the mass range that could in principle be tested at colliders. This comparison should be taken as a starting point for more dedicated studies at both hadron-hadron and lepton-lepton machines.

Furthermore, we reported on the sensitivity of the HL-LHC for {new physics-}initiated cascade decays leading to ${h}\,{h}\,{h}$ final states, with subsequent decays into 3 $b\,\bar{b}$ pairs. We found that at the HL-LHC all considered benchmark points such be within discovery range, while some statements could already be made for several benchmark points for an integrated luminosity of a few hundred $\fb^{-1}$. We strongly encourage the LHC experimental collaborations to adapt this search using current and future LHC data.
