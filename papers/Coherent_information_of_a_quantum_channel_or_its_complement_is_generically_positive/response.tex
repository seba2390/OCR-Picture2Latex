\maketitle

We would like to thank all the Reviewers for the time and effort that they invested in reading our manuscript. We are grateful to them for their valuable feedback. Our response to their suggestions is included below.


\section{Reviewer 1}

Except for a couple of stylistic changes which are discussed below, all the other changes recommended by Reviewer 1 have been implemented in the manuscript.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since the proof of the main theorem and the necessary background to understand it are quite technical, we think they are better placed in the appendix. However, we have now added a small paragraph discussing the key idea of the proof in the main body of the text just before Theorem 3.3.
    \item We think that the summary of main results and the accompanying discussion are better suited to be placed in the introduction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reviewer 2}

\noindent {\color{red}{\textbf{Comment 1:} }} Following my previous comment, I would suggest the authors to add a couple of paragraphs summarizing notable families of channels and the dimensions of the output and the environment. \\

\textbf{Response:} This has already been done in great detail in our previous paper, see \cite{Singh2022detecting}. We have stated this in the introduction where we cite our previous work. \\

\section{Reviewer 3}

All changes suggested by Reviewer 3 have now been implemented in the paper.
