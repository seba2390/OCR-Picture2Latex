%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.31 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls and other external packages such as
%% latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf.  Note that as of 
%% Oct 2020, APS now uses revtex4.2e for its journals but remember that 
%% AASTeX v6+ still uses v4.1. All of these external packages should 
%% already be present in the modern TeX distributions but not always.
%% For example, revtex4.1 seems to be missing in the linux version of
%% TexLive 2020. One should be able to get all packages from www.ctan.org.
%% In particular, revtex v4.1 can be found at 
%% https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass{aastex631}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex631}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Supresses an abstract. Originally for RNAAS manuscripts 
%%                but now that abstracts are required this is obsolete for
%%                AAS Journals. Authors might need it for other reasons. DO NOT
%%                use \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex631}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% Note that in v6.3 "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are
%% commented out).
%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.
%\setcounter{table}{1}

\title{The "super-active" accretion phase of T CrB has ended}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.31 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that
%% the nearby authors are not part of surrounding collaborations.

\begin{abstract}

The symbiotic recurrent nova T CrB erupted for the second and last recorded
time in 1946.  Following the outburst, the accretion rate onto its WD has
remained rather low with only occasional and minor flaring episodes, until in late
2014 it entered a "super-active" phase (SAP) that peaked in April 2016: the
flux radiated by Balmer lines increased by two orders of magnitude, accompanied
by the appearance of strong HeI, HeII, and many other emission lines. 
Following the sharp maximum, the intensity of the emission lines has been steadily
decreasing, reaching back the pre-SAP levels by mid-2023.  The end of SAP is
also confirmed by the drop of $B$-band brightness to pre-SAP conditions and
the simultaneous re-appearance of a large-amplitude flickering.  This suggest
that the accretion disk has emptied from the extra material that has driven
the "super active" state and has completed its transfer onto the WD, setting
the stage for a new and probably imminent nova eruption.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

T CrB is a very famous recurrent nova \citep[eruptions recorded in 1866 and
1946;][and references therein]{1964gano.book.....P} and is also a
symbiotic binary by harboring a red giant (RG) as the donor star to the
massive white dwarf (WD) companion.

The life-cycle of a symbiotic binary as outlined by
\citet{2019arXiv190901389M}, is characterized by long accretion phases
interspersed by shorter periods during which the material accumulated on the
surface of the WD is burned nuclearly.  If the accreted shell is not
electron degenerate, the burning proceeds in thermal equilibrium for
decades/centuries until most of the hydrogen fuel in the shell is consumed,
the burning finally quenches down, and a new long-lasting phase of accretion
initiates the next cycle (examples are V4368 Sgr, HM Sge, and V1016 Cyg). 
When the accreted shell is instead electron degenerate, the nuclear burning
proceeds explosively resulting in a nova outburst, with most of the shell
expelled in the process and the residual nuclear burning on the WD extinguishes in a
few weeks/months, after which accretion resumes and a new cycle begins.  In
addition to T CrB, other well known symbiotic recurrent novae are RS Oph,
V3890 Sgr, and V745 Sco.

Traditionally, accretion in symbiotic stars has been treated as a smooth
process relatively stable over long periods of time
\citep[eg.][]{1986syst.book.....K}.  This approach has progressively changed
in favor of a highly-episodic interpretation of the accretion process,
characterized by brief periods of (very) high accretion rates in-between
longer intervals spent at much lower mass-transfer rates
\citep[eg.][]{2020ApJ...902L..14L,2021MNRAS.505.6121M}.
 
\citet{2016NewA...47....7M} has called attention to the fact that starting
with 2015, T CrB entered a "super-active" accretion phase (SAP),
characterized by a much brighter accretion disk as the result of a greatly
enhanced mass-flow through it and then toward the central WD.  The accretion
level attained during SAP largely exceeded any other experienced by T CrB
since the 1946 eruption.  By noting that a similar event preceded the 1946
nova outburst, \citet{2016NewA...47....7M} concluded that SAP is probably
announcing a new and imminent eruption of T CrB, a view shared by
\citet{2023arXiv230304933S}.

flux of selected emission lines measured on low-resolution spectra, all obtained
with the Asiago 1.22m + B\&C (and 300 ln/mm grating). While H$\beta$ is discernible
in emission at all epochs, higher excitation/ionization lines turned on only during
the "super-active" accretion phase (the arrows point to missing-line epochs).}
\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}

We have been regularly recording fluxed spectra of T CrB for the last $\sim$35 yrs,
initially with the Asiago 1.82m + B\&C and since 2006 with the
Asiago 1.22m + B\&C telescope.  For all the 1.22m spectra, we adopted a 300
ln/mm grating blazed at 5000~\AA\ that paired with a completely
UV-transparent optical train and a highly UV-sensitive CCD detector (ANDOR iDus
DU440A with a back-illuminated E2V 42-10 chip, 2048$\times$512 array, and 
13.5 $\mu$m pixel size), allows to efficiently record spectra down to the
$\sim$3100~\AA\ atmospheric cut-off imposed by the telescope 1000m altitude above sea
level.  Our 1.22m spectra of T CrB extend from 3200 to 7900 \AA\ at
2.3~\AA/pix dispersion.  In addition to being fluxed thanks to nightly
observations of spectrophotometric standard stars, their flux zero-point is
fine-tuned against (nearly-)simultaneous $B$$V$$R$ photometry, so that
the flux error anywhere in the spectra rarely exceed a few percent.  This
2006-2023 set of T CrB spectra is therefore characterized by a highly stable
instrumental set-up and robust IRAF calibration procedures, and constitutes an ideal
sample for variability studies of spectral features over long intervals of
time. A few of the spectra of T CrB here considered can be viewed in \citet{2016NewA...47....7M}.

\section{The end of the "super active" accretion phase} \label{sec:results}

To trace the evolution of T CrB along the "super active" accretion phase, we
have measured the integrated flux of a sample of emission lines on the
2006-2023 Asiago 1.22m + B\&C spectra described in the previous section. 
The selected lines are H$\beta$, HeI 5876, and HeII 4686, which are
representative of low, medium, and high excitation/ionization conditions,
respectively.  Their absolute fluxes are plotted in Figure~1 along with the
$B$-band lightcurve of T CrB as recorded by ANS Collaboration.

Prior to 2014, both HeI 5876 and HeII 4686 were not visible in emission, 
and H$\beta$ has been present but always at rather feeble levels.
During this period the $B$-band lightcurve is dominated by the ellipsoidal
distortion of the RG with superimposed the scattering due to the
large-amplitude and always present flickering \citep[eg.][and references
therein]{1998A&A...338..988Z,2010MNRAS.402.2567D}.

The start of the "super active" accretion phase in late 2014 is marked by
the sudden appearance in emission of HeI 5876 and HeII 4686, a corresponding
rise of H$\beta$ \citep[compare the spectra for
2014-11-02 and 2012-09-03 in][]{2016NewA...47....7M}, and a large increase
in $B$-band brightness caused by the rapidly brightening accretion disk. 
SAP reached its maximum in April 2016, when the flux of all emission lines
sharply peaked, as illustrated by Figure~1.  Around this epoch strong
satellite UV and thermal radio emission were also recorded
\citep{2018A&A...619A..61L,2019ApJ...884....8L}.

Following the maximum in April 2016, the flux of all emission lines has
gone steadily decreasing, at a faster pace for higher excitation/ionization
lines, and by mid-2023 they have returned to pre-SAP values, indicating that
the "super active" accretion phase is finally over.  Also the $B$-band
photometric brightness has been quickly dropping during the last few months,
while the flickering has returned to the usual large amplitude
\citep{2023ATel16023....1M} compared to the much reduced impact it had on
photometry collected around SAP maximum \citep{2016ATel.8675....1Z}.

The disappearance of emission lines, the drop in $B$-band brightness, and
the return to large amplitude flickering suggest that the accretion disk has
emptied from the extra material that driven the "super active" state and has
completed its transfer onto the WD.  The shell around the latter may
possibly still takes a little to cool and shrink down to favorable
conditions, but the stage for a new nova outburst appears now inevitably
set.
