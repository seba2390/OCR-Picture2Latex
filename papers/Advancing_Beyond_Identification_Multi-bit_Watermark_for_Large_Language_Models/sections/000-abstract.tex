We propose a method to tackle misuses of large language models beyond the identification of machine-generated text. While existing methods focus on detection, some malicious misuses demand tracing the adversary user for counteracting them. To address this, we propose ``Multi-bit Watermark via Position Allocation'', embedding traceable multi-bit information during language model generation. Leveraging the benefits of zero-bit watermarking~\citep{kirchenbauer2023watermark}, our method enables robust extraction of the watermark without any model access, embedding and extraction of long messages ($\geq$ 32-bit) without finetuning, and maintaining text quality, while allowing zero-bit detection all at the same time. Moreover, our watermark is relatively robust under strong attacks like interleaving human texts and paraphrasing.
