\section{Timeline}
\label{sec:time}

I am currently in my third year of my four-year Ph.D. program. In my third year, I plan to continue working on  my research, focusing mainly on \textit{RQ2} and \textit{RQ3}, while also finishing answering \textit{RQ1}.   In my last year, we will focus on \textit{RQ4} in order to complete it in my fourth year.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

As a conclusion of this thesis, a synthesis of all four research questions will be provided, including a proposed tool to retrieve the practices.  This will help to reduce the gap of not having a clear handbook of ML practices applied to SE, since the set of validated practices will be oriented to the SE community with practitioners' and researchers' perspectives, which will be complemented with context and SE use cases.
