\begin{abstract}
Let  $z=x+iy \in \mathbb{H}:=\{z= x+ i y\in\mathbb{C}: y>0\}$  and $
\theta (\alpha;z)=\sum_{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2 } e^{-\alpha \frac{\pi }{y }|mz+n|^2}$ be the theta function associated with the lattice $L ={\mathbb Z}\oplus z{\mathbb Z}$. In this paper we consider the following minimization problem of difference of two theta functions
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber

where $\alpha \geq 1$ and $ \beta \in (-\infty, +\infty)$. We prove that there is a critical value $\beta_c=\sqrt2$ (independent of $\alpha$) such that if $\beta\leq\beta_c$, the minimizer  is $\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ (up to translation and rotation) which corresponds to the hexagonal lattice, and if $\beta>\beta_c$, the minimizer does not exist.  Our result  partially answers some questions raised in  \cite{Bet2016, Bet2018, Bet2020, Bet2019AMP} and gives a new proof in   the crystallization of hexagonal
lattice under Yukawa potential.

\section{Introduction and Statement of Main Results}
\setcounter{equation}{0}


Let $L$ be a two dimensional lattice. A large class of physical problems can be reduced to the following minimization problem:
 \begin{equation}\aligned\label{EFL}
\min_L E_f(\Lambda ), \;\;\hbox{where}\;\;E_f(L):=\sum_{\mathbb{P}\in L \backslash\{0\}} f(|\mathbb{P}|^2).
\endaligned\end{equation}
The function $f$ denotes the potential of the system and  the summation ranges over all the lattice points except for the origin $0$. The function
$E_f(L)$ denotes the total energy of the system under the background potential $f$ over a periodical lattice $L$, which arises in various physical problems (\cite{Bet2015,Bet2016,Bet2018,Bet2019,Bet2019AMP,Betermin2021JPA, Serfaty2018}). For example there is a clear connection of lattice sum and Abrikosov vortex lattices (see e.g. \cite{Abr}, \cite{Che2007}, \cite{Sigal2018}, \cite{Serfaty2010}, \cite{Serfaty2012}, \cite{Serfaty2014}, \cite{Luo2019}).
In the physical aspect, $E_f(L)$ refers to crystal lattice energy (\cite{ChenPRL1990,Shen2005}) and Hamiltonian of crystals with long-ranged interaction (\cite{MatAMS}). The function $E_f(L)$ has deep link with the partition function which is fundamental in equilibrium statistical physics. Locating the minimizer of such a total energy $E_f(L)$ over all the shapes of the lattices has important applications  in physics (\cite{Betermin2021JPA, Fey, Ho2001,Mue2002, Mat1999}), number theory (see e.g., \cite{Osg1988}, \cite{Sar2006}, \cite{Bla2015}), adsorption on non-ideal surfaces \cite{Cero1993}, etc.  The application of number theory to physics has many aspects and some of them reveal unexpected discovery. Significant examples of this direction went back to \cite{Cohen}, \cite{ChenPRL1990}, \cite{Sch2011}, \cite{Yuan2010} and the references therein. For other examples see  the book \cite{Number}.



Let $ z\in \mathbb{H}:=\{z= x+ i y\in\mathbb{C}: y>0\}$ and $L ={\mathbb Z}\oplus z{\mathbb Z}$ be the lattice in $ \mathbb{R}^2$.
When $ f(\cdot)=e^{- \alpha |\cdot|^2}$ ($\alpha>0$) and the corresponding $E_f (L)$ becomes the the theta function
 \begin{equation}
 \label{thetas}
\theta (\alpha; z):=\sum_{\mathbb{P}\in\Lambda} e^{- \alpha |\mathbb{P}|^2}=\sum_{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2} e^{-\alpha \frac{\pi }{y }|mz+n|^2},
\end{equation}
a celebrated result of  Montgomery (\cite{Mon1988}) states that the hexagonal lattice attains the minimimizer in (\ref{EFL}).  By the classical Bernstein representation formula, Montgomery's result can be extended to any completely monotone functions, which are   $C^\infty(0,\infty)$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
\label{Complete}
(-1)^j f^{(j)}(x)>0, j=0,1,2,\cdots \infty.
\end{equation}

In  \cite{LW2021} we  have considered the following minimization problem of sum of two theta functions
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{EFL1}
\min_{z \in {\mathbb H}} \Big(\theta(\alpha; z)+\rho \theta (\alpha; \frac{z+1}{2})\Big)
\endaligned\end{equation}
and showed that the hexagonal-rhombic-square-rectangular transition appears as $\rho$ goes from $0$ to $+\infty$. This result can also be generalized to completely monotone functions.



 However, in many physical models, the potential function $ f$ may not be completely monotone. A classical example is the Lennard-Jones potential $ f(r)= \frac{1}{r^6}- \frac{2}{r^3}$ (see e.g. \cite{Baskes}) and its generalization
     $f(r)=\frac{a_1}{r^{t_1}}-\frac{a_2}{r^{t_2}}$, where $t_1>t_2>0, a_1,a_2>0$.    In \cite{Bet2018, Bet2020, Bet2019AMP},  B\'etermin and his collaborators   initiated  a theoretical study of the \eqref{EFL} with the Lennard-Jones type potential.  A numerical simulation suggests the hexagonal-rhombic-square-rectangular lattice phase transitions. Observe that the Lennard-Jones potential consists of two parts, each part being completely monotone. In addition, it is of one-well potential as introduced and defined in \cite{Bet2018}, i.e., there exists $a>0$ such that f is nonincreasing on $(0, a)$ and nondecreasing
on $(a, +\infty)$. The following conjecture was made in \cite{Bet2018}:
     \begin{conjecture}[\cite{Bet2018}, last page; open question 1.16  of \cite{Bet2019AMP}]\label{BetConjecture}
     \begin{itemize}
       \item The behavior of the minimizers of \eqref{EFL} with respect to the lattice area A is qualitatively the
same for all the Lennard-Jones type potentials (i.e., admits hexagonal-rhombic-square-rectangular lattice phase transitions);

       \item more generally, we can imagine that we should find the same result for any potential f written
as $f:=f_1-f_2$,
where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are both completely monotone and f is of one-well.
     \end{itemize}

     \end{conjecture}

For non-monotone potentials, there are other interesting open problems concerning the energy functional \eqref{EFL}, which we list some of them here:

\begin{conjecture}[Conjecture 2.7 of B\'etermin, Faulhuber and Kn$\ddot{u}$pfer \cite{Bet2020}]\label{Conjecture2}
The existence of square lattice minimizes the lattice energy $E_f(L)$ when $f(r)=e^{-\beta \pi r}-e^{-\alpha \pi r}$ for $|\beta-\alpha|$
bigger than some small positive number.
\end{conjecture}

\begin{open question}[B\'etermin-Petrache, \cite{Bet2019AMP}]\label{Open1}
Question 1.1: If $f(r^2)$ is not a positive superposition of Gaussians, can the triangular(hexagonal)
lattice still be a minimizer of $E_f[L]$ among lattices at any fixed density?

\end{open question}

\begin{open question}[Question 1.8 of B\'etermin-Petrache, \cite{Bet2019AMP}]\label{Open2}
 Is there any non-completely monotone $f$ for which the minimizer of
$E_f[L]$ is the triangular lattice for all $\lambda>0$, among periodic configurations $C$ of
unit density?

\end{open question}

\begin{open question}[Open Problem 1.9 of B\'etermin-Petrache \cite{Bet2019AMP}]\label{OpenA}
 [Stability of crystallization phenomena, with respect to perturbations of $f$] Study and classify natural distances between (or other measures of the size
of perturbations of) interaction kernels $f$ , with respect to which small perturbations
of $f$ can be ensured to preserve the crystallization properties of the kernels, such as
the existence and shape of the global minimum amongst periodic configurations.

\end{open question}





In this paper, we  study  the existence and nonexistence of the minimizer  for the potentials in the
form of difference  of two completely monotone functions. As a consequence, we give affirmative answers to Conjectures \ref{BetConjecture} and \ref{Conjecture2} and answer partially some other open questions listed as above.

Let $\theta (\alpha;z)$ be the theta function defined at (\ref{thetas}). The following is the main result of this paper.

\begin{theorem}\label{Th1} Let $\alpha \geq 1$ and $\beta\in \R$. Consider the minimizing  of difference  of two theta functions with different frequencies, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{EFL33} \aligned
\min_{   \mathbb{H} }\Big(\theta (\alpha; z)-\beta\theta (2\alpha; z)\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}

 There is a critical value $\beta_c=\sqrt2$ (independent of $\alpha$) such that
 \begin{itemize}
   \item if $\beta\leq\beta_c$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional  is $\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ (up to translation and rotation), which corresponds to the hexagonal lattice;
   \item if $\beta>\beta_c$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional does not exist.
 \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}



For many physical applications, we state an equivalent form of Theorem \ref{Th1} in the following Theorem \ref{Th2}. 

\begin{theorem}\label{Th2}  Let $\gamma\in(0,1]$ and $\beta \in \R$. Consider the minimizing problem
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\min_{   \mathbb{H} }\Big(\theta (\gamma; z)-\beta\theta (\frac{1}{2}\gamma; z)\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
There is a critical value $\beta_{s}=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$ (independent of $\alpha$) such that if $\beta\leq\beta_s$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional  is $\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ (up to translation and rotation), and if  $\beta>\beta_s$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional does not exist.
\end{theorem}


In the following, we discuss applications to two special potentials: the exponential potential and Yukawa potential. For exponential potentials we have
\begin{theorem}\label{Th3} Let $E_f[L]$ be defined as
$$
E_f(L):=\sum_{\mathbb{P}\in L\backslash\{0\}} f(|\mathbb{P}|^2)
$$
with the area of two dimensional lattice $L$ is normalized to 1.
Consider the potential $f$ has the following form
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
f_\alpha(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\beta e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}, \;\; \alpha\geq1,\\
g_\gamma(r):&=e^{-\pi\gamma\cdot r}-\beta e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\gamma\cdot r},\;\;\gamma\in(0,1).
\endaligned\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There exists $\beta_c=\sqrt2$ (independent of $\alpha$) such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $\beta\leq\beta_c$, the minimizer of $E_{f_\alpha}[L]$ exists and is always hexagonal lattice;
  \item if $\beta>\beta_c$, the minimizer of $E_{f_\alpha}[L]$ does not exists.
\end{itemize}
  \item There exists $\beta_s=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$ (independent of $\gamma$) such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $\beta\leq\beta_s$, the minimizer of $E_{g_\gamma}[L]$ exists and is always hexagonal lattice;
  \item if $\beta>\beta_s$, the minimizer of $E_{g_\gamma}[L]$ does not exists.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}[{\bf An negative answer to Conjecture \ref{BetConjecture}}]

If one regards
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
h_{\alpha_1,\beta}(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha_1\cdot r}-\beta e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\alpha_1\cdot r}, \beta>0,\\
L_{\alpha_2}:&=\alpha_2\cdot L, \alpha_2>0, \alpha:=\alpha_1\cdot\alpha_2<1,
\endaligned\end{equation}
then $h_{\alpha_1,\beta}(r)$ is the difference of two completely monotone functions and is a one well potential
 and
$$
E_{h_{\alpha_1,\beta}}[L_{\alpha_2}]=E_{g_\alpha}[L].
$$
However $E_{h_{\alpha_1,\beta}}[L_\alpha]$ admits minimizer always at hexagonal lattice for any $\beta\in(0,\beta_s]$ as the lattice density $\alpha_2$ changes in $(0,\frac{1}{\alpha_1})$$($one can choose $\alpha_1$ to close $0$ then $\frac{1}{\alpha_1}\rightarrow\infty$$)$. This disproves the hexagonal-rhombic-square-rectangular lattice phase transitions (see e.g.,\cite{Betermin2021JPA,Bet2020}) and gives an negative answer to Conjecture \ref{BetConjecture} and open question 1.16 of B\'etermin-Petrache \cite{Bet2019AMP}. More general potentials of difference of two completely monotone type are shown in Theorem \ref{Th4} via the Laplace transform.


\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[{\bf A negative answer to Conjecture \ref{Conjecture2} on dimension two}] As shown in the Theorem \ref{Th3}, there is no square lattice being minimizer for potential of such form.

\end{remark}
\begin{remark}[{\bf A partial answer to Open Question \ref{Open1}}] Note that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
h_\beta(r^2)=e^{-\pi\cdot r^2}-\beta e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\cdot r^2}, \;\; \beta>0,
\endaligned\end{equation}
is the difference  of two Gaussians $($hence  not a positive superposition of Gaussians$)$, the hexagonal lattice is always the minimizer for any fixed density $\alpha\geq1$. This partially answers open question \ref{Open1}.





\end{remark}


\begin{remark}[{\bf Partial answer on Open Question \ref{OpenA}}] We discuss two aspects: the stability and instability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(${\bf Instability under small perturbation: critical parameter}$)$. Let
  \begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
f_{0,\alpha}(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\sqrt2 e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}, \;\; \alpha\geq1,\\
g_{0,\gamma}(r):&=e^{-\pi\gamma\cdot r}-\frac{\sqrt2}{2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\gamma\cdot r}\;\; \gamma\in(0,1).
\endaligned\end{equation}
A small perturbation of  $f_{0,\alpha}(r)$ and $g_{0,\gamma}(r)$ from left hand side by $\varepsilon e^{-2 c\cdot r}$ will lead to the minimizer of $E_f[L]$ does not exist. Namely, let
  \begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
f_{0,\alpha,\varepsilon}(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\sqrt2 e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\varepsilon e^{-2 c\cdot r}, \;\; \alpha\geq1\\
g_{0,\gamma,\varepsilon}(r):&=e^{-\pi\gamma\cdot r}-\frac{\sqrt2}{2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\gamma\cdot r}-\varepsilon e^{-2 c\cdot r}\;\; \gamma\in(0,1),
\endaligned\end{equation}
for $\forall c>0, \forall\varepsilon>0$ be a small perturbation of $f_{0,\alpha}(r), g_{0,\gamma}(r)$, the minimizers of $E_{f_{0,\alpha,\varepsilon}}[L]$ and $E_{g_{0,\gamma,\varepsilon}}[\Lambda]$ do not exist and the minimizers of $E_{f_{0,\alpha}}[L]$ and $E_{g_{0,\gamma}}[L]$ are both hexagonal lattice. In this sense, the minimizers of $E_{f_{0,\alpha}}[L]$ are instable under small perturbation as above.


  \item $(${\bf Stability under small perturbation: subcritical parameter}$)$.
Assume $\beta<\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$. Let $|\varepsilon|\leq\frac{\sqrt2}{2}-\beta$ and
  \begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
g_{\alpha,\varepsilon}(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\beta e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}\pm\varepsilon e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}, \;\; \alpha\geq1,
\endaligned\end{equation}
be a small perturbation of $g_{\alpha}(r)$.
Then the minimizer of $E_{g_{\alpha,\varepsilon}(r)}[L]$ is still the hexagonal lattice, i.e., the minimizer of $E_{g_{\alpha}(r)}[L]$ is stable under small perturbation as above.



\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} The numerical study of the potential
 \begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
f_\alpha(r):&=e^{-\pi\alpha\cdot r}-\beta e^{-2\pi\alpha\cdot r}
\endaligned\end{equation}
is performed as an important cases in B\'etermin-Faulhuber-Kn$\ddot{u}$pfer \cite{Bet2020}, see Figures 3, 8 and 10 of \cite{Bet2020}.

\end{remark}


Using the free parameter $\alpha$ of Theorem \ref{Th3}, we proceed Theorem \ref{Th2} and \ref{Th3} to a general form by the Laplace transform (inspired by B\'etermin \cite{Bet2016}). There is a difference between Theorem \ref{Th4} and Theorems \ref{Th1}, \ref{Th2}, \ref{Th3}. In the former, one does not know the parameter is optimal or not, and in the latter, the parameters are optimal as stated in the Theorems.

\begin{theorem}\label{Th4}
Let $E_f[L]$ be defined as
$$
E_f(L):=\sum_{\mathbb{P}\in L \backslash\{0\}} f(|\mathbb{P}|^2)
$$
with the area of two dimensional lattice $L$ is normalized to 1.
Consider the potential $f_{\alpha,P}, g_{\alpha,P}$ have the following form
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{FFGG}
f_{\alpha,P}(r):&=\int_1^\infty \Big(\big(e^{-\pi\alpha x\cdot r}-\beta e^{-2\pi\alpha x\cdot r}\big)\cdot P(x)\Big)dx, \;\; \alpha\geq1,\\
g_{\gamma,P}(r):&=\int_0^1 \Big(\big(e^{-\pi\gamma x\cdot r}-\beta e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi\gamma x\cdot r}\big)\cdot P(x)\Big)dx, \;\; \gamma\in(0,1),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where the $P(x)$ is any real function(not necessarily continuous) such that $f_{\alpha,P}(r), g_{\alpha,P}(r)$ are finite and
$$P(x)\geq0.$$

Then there exists $\beta_c=\sqrt2, \beta_s=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$ and nonnegative function $P$ such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $\beta\leq\beta_c$, the minimizer of $E_{f_{\alpha,P}}[\Lambda]$ exists and is always hexagonal lattice.
  \item if $\beta\leq\beta_s$, the minimizer of $E_{g_{\gamma,P}}[\Lambda]$ exists and is always hexagonal lattice.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}[{\bf Partial answer on open question 1.6 of B\'etermin-Petrache \cite{Bet2019AMP}}] Theorem \ref{Th4} partially answers open question 1.6 of B\'etermin-Petrache \cite{Bet2019AMP} on minimizers of difference of two Laplace transform of the potentials.

\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Connection to G-type potentials] The potential introduced by \eqref{FFGG} are a subclass of G-type potentials $($see Chapter 10 of monograph \cite{B10}$)$. Here we show that under these potentials the minimizer of the lattice energy are hexagonal lattice under suitable competing strength $\beta$.

\end{remark}


\begin{remark}[\bf Partial answer on Open Question \ref{Open2}] Since here $f_{\alpha,P}(r),(\alpha\geq1)$ is the difference of two completely monotone functions, and hence not completely monotone. The minimizer of $E_{f_{\alpha,P}(r)}[\lambda\cdot L]$ is hexagonal lattice for all $\lambda\geq1$. This gives partial answer on Open question \ref{Open2}.


\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[{\bf More potentials to answer Conjecture \ref{BetConjecture}}] Theorem \ref{Th4} provides general potentials to a negative answer to Conjecture \ref{BetConjecture}.
\end{remark}



A particular  application of  Theorem \ref{Th4} is the classical  Yukawa potential case.
\begin{corollary}[{\bf Yukawa potential$\{\cong P(x)\equiv1\}$ of Theorem \ref{Th4}}]\label{Coro1}

Let $E_f[L]$ be defined as
$$
E_f(L):=\sum_{\mathbb{P}\in L\backslash\{0\}} f(|\mathbb{P}|^2)
$$
with the area of two dimensional lattice $L$ is normalized to 1.
Consider the potential $f_{1,\alpha}, g_{1,\alpha}$ have the following form
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
f_{1,\alpha}(r):&=\frac{e^{-\pi\alpha r}}{r}-\beta\frac{e^{-2\pi\alpha r}}{2r}, \;\; \alpha\geq1.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then there exists $\beta_c=\sqrt2$ independent of parameter $\alpha$ such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $\beta\leq\beta_c$, the minimizer of $E_{f_{1,\alpha}}[L]$ exists and is always hexagonal lattice.
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark} The rigorous results on Yukawa potential of the minimizer of the crystal energy $E_f[L]$, as far as we know, is initiated by B\'etermin \cite{Bet2016}. Here Corollary \ref{Coro1} improves the result in \cite{Bet2016} on some aspects. Note that we provide an effective way to prove the crystallization of hexagonal lattice under Yukawa potential.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark} In using the results of Corollary \ref{Coro1} and combining the method of B\'etermin \cite{Bet2016}, one can obtain more general results on minimization results under Yukawa potential.
\end{remark}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Theorem \ref{Th1} can be extended as follows by iteration.
\begin{theorem}\label{ThA} Consider the minimizing problem of difference of two theta functions
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\min_{   \mathbb{H} }\Big(\theta (\alpha; z)-\beta\theta (2^k\alpha; z)\Big),\;\;\hbox{for any}\;\alpha\geq1,k\geq0, k\in\mathbb{Z},\;\beta\in(-\infty,\infty).
\endaligned\end{equation}
There is a critical value $\beta_{A}=\sqrt{2^k}$ independent of $\alpha$ such that
 \begin{itemize}
   \item if $\beta\leq\beta_A$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional  is $\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ up to translation and rotation, this minimizer corresponds to $\Lambda$ is the hexagonal lattice;
   \item if $\beta>\beta_A$, the minimizer of the lattice energy functional does not exist.
 \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we state some basic preliminaries about the functional $ \theta (\alpha;z)-\beta \theta (2\alpha;z)$.
In Section 3, we prove that the minimization problem on the fundamental region (see \eqref{Fd3} and figure \ref{f-FFF}) can be reduced to a vertical line (see figure \ref{f-FFF}). (See Theorem \ref{2Th2}.)
In Section 4, we prove that the minimization problem on the vertical line can be reduced to a particular point (hexagonal point (see figure \ref{f-FFF})). We develop effective methods and delicate analysis to obtain the estimates, which can be generalized to solve related problems. As a consequence we prove Theorem \ref{Th1}. Finally Section 5 contains proofs of remaining Theorems.

\section{Preliminaries }
\setcounter{equation}{0}

In this section we collect  some simple symmetries of the theta function $\theta (s; z)$ and the associated fundamental domain, and also the properties of Jacobi theta functions to be used in later sections.

Let
$
\mathbb{H}
$
 denote the upper half plane and  $\mathcal{S} $ denote the modular group
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{modular}
\mathcal{S}:=SL_2(\mathbb{Z})=\{
\left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    a & b \\
    c & d \\
  \end{array}
\right), ad-bc=1, a, b, c, d\in\mathbb{Z}
\}.
\endaligned\end{equation}


We use the following definition of fundamental domain which is slightly different from the classical definition (see \cite{Mon1988}):
\begin{definition} [page 108, \cite{Eva1973}]
The fundamental domain associated to group $G$ is a connected domain $\mathcal{D}$ satisfies
\begin{itemize}
  \item For any $z\in\mathbb{H}$, there exists an element $\pi\in G$ such that $\pi(z)\in\overline{\mathcal{D}}$;
  \item Suppose $z_1,z_2\in\mathcal{D}$ and $\pi(z_1)=z_2$ for some $\pi\in G$, then $z_1=z_2$ and $\pi=\pm Id$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

By Definition 1, the fundamental domain associated to modular group $\mathcal{S}$ is
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Fd1}
\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{S}}:=\{
z\in\mathbb{H}: |z|>1,\; -\frac{1}{2}<x<\frac{1}{2}
\}
\endaligned\end{equation}
which is open.  Note that the fundamental domain can be open. (See [page 30, \cite{Apo1976}].)


Next we introduce another group related  to the functionals $\theta(\alpha;z)$. The generators of the group are given by
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{GroupG1}
\mathcal{G}: \hbox{the group generated by} \;\;\tau\mapsto -\frac{1}{\tau},\;\; \tau\mapsto \tau+1,\;\;\tau\mapsto -\overline{\tau}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

It is easy to see that
the fundamental domain associated to group $\mathcal{G}$ denoted by $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}$ is
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Fd3}
\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}:=\{
z\in\mathbb{H}: |z|>1,\; 0<x<\frac{1}{2}
\}.
\endaligned\end{equation}








The following lemma characterizes the fundamental symmetries of the theta functions $\theta (s; z)$. The proof is easy so we omit it.
\begin{lemma}\label{G111} For any $s>0$, any $\gamma\in \mathcal{G}$ and $z\in\mathbb{H}$,
$\ \theta (s; \gamma(z))=\theta (s;z)$.
\end{lemma}

Let
\begin{equation}\label{Wbeta} \aligned
\mathrm{W}_\beta(\alpha; z):=\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}\label{Geee}  For any $\alpha>0$, any $\gamma\in \mathcal{G}$ and $z\in\mathbb{H}$,
$\mathrm{W}_\beta(\alpha; \gamma(z))=\mathrm{W}_\beta (\alpha;z)$.
\end{lemma}





We also need some delicate analysis of the Jacobi theta function.

We first recall the following well-known Jacobi triple product formula:
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Jacob1}
\prod_{m=1}^\infty(1-x^{2m})(1+x^{2m-1}y^2)(1+\frac{x^{2m-1}}{y^2})=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty x^{n^2} y^{2n}
 \endaligned\end{equation}
for complex numbers $x,y$ with $|x|<1$, $y\neq0$.


The Jacobi theta function is defined as
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\vartheta_J(z;\tau):=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{i\pi n^2 \tau+2\pi i n z},
 \endaligned\end{equation}
and the classical one-dimensional theta function  is given by
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{TXY}
\vartheta(X;Y):=\vartheta_J(Y;iX)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\pi n^2 X} e^{2n\pi i Y}.
 \endaligned\end{equation}
Hence by the Jacobi triple product formula \eqref{Jacob1}, it holds
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Product}
\vartheta(X;Y)=\prod_{n=1}^\infty(1-e^{-2\pi n X})(1+e^{-2(2n-1)\pi X}+2e^{-(2n-1)\pi X}\cos(2\pi Y)).
 \endaligned\end{equation}


The following Lemmas \ref{LemmaTTT} and \ref{LemmaT2} are proved in  \cite{Luo2022}.
\begin{lemma}\label{LemmaTTT} Assume $X>\frac{1}{5}$. If $\sin(2\pi Y)>0$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
-\overline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y)\leq\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(X;Y)\leq-\underline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y).
 \endaligned\end{equation}
If $\sin(2\pi Y)<0$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
-\underline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y)\leq\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(X;Y)\leq-\overline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y).
 \endaligned\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\underline\vartheta(X):=4\pi e^{-\pi X}(1-\mu(X)), \;\; \overline\vartheta(X):=4\pi e^{-\pi X}(1+\mu(X)),
 \endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{mmmx}
\mu(X):=\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-\pi(n^2-1)X}.
\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{lemma}\label{LemmaT2}
Assume $X<\min\{\frac{\pi}{\pi+2},\frac{\pi}{4\log\pi}\}=\frac{\pi}{\pi+2}$. If $\sin(2\pi Y)>0$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
-\overline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y)\leq\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(X;Y)\leq-\underline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y).
 \endaligned\end{equation}
If $\sin(2\pi Y)<0$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
-\underline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y)\leq\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(X;Y)\leq-\overline\vartheta(X)\sin(2\pi Y).
 \endaligned\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\underline\vartheta(X):=\pi e^{-\frac{\pi}{4X}}X^{-\frac{3}{2}};\;\; \overline\vartheta(X):=X^{-\frac{3}{2}}.
 \endaligned\end{equation}


\end{lemma}

\section{The transversal monotonicity}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
Let $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}:=\{
z\in\mathbb{H}: |z|>1,\; 0<x<\frac{1}{2}
\}$ be the fundamental domain associated to the group $\mathcal{G}$. Define the vertical line
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Gfff}
\Gamma:=\{
z\in\mathbb{H}: \Re(z)=\frac{1}{2},\; \Im(z)\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}
\}.
\endaligned\end{equation}



By the group invariance (Lemma \ref{Geee}), one has
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Domain1}
\min_{z\in\mathbb{H}}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)
=\min_{z\in\overline{\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}

Let $\mu (X)$ be defined in (\ref{mmmx}) and
\begin{equation} \label{beta0} \aligned
\beta_0:=\min\begin{cases}
\frac{\pi e^{2\pi}-4e^{-6\pi}}{2}\\
\frac{\sqrt2 e^{\frac{\sqrt3\pi}{4}}(1-\mu(\frac{1}{2}))-4e^{-\frac{5\sqrt3\pi}{4}}(1+\mu(\frac{1}{4}))}{1+\mu(\frac{1}{4})}\\
\frac{4\sqrt2\pi e^\pi\big(1-\mu(\frac{1}{4})\big)-16\sqrt2\pi e^{-\frac{7\pi}{2}}\big(1+\mu(\frac{1}{4})\big)}{64}.
\end{cases}
\endaligned\end{equation}
Numerically,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\beta_0:\cong3.801819\cdots.
\endaligned\end{equation}
As we shall see in the next Section, one only needs to require that $\beta_0\geq\sqrt2$
to obtain all the main results.



In this section, we aim to establish that
\begin{theorem}\label{2Th1} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. Let $\beta_0$ be defined at (\ref{beta0}). Then   for $\beta<\beta_0$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\min_{z\in\mathbb{H}}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)=\min_{z\in\overline{\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)=\min_{z\in\Gamma}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is a vertical line and defined at \eqref{Gfff}.
\end{theorem}



The proof of Theorem \ref{2Th1} follows from the following monotonicity result
\begin{theorem}\label{2Th3}
Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. Then for $\beta<\beta_0$
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)
<0, \;\;\hbox{for}\;\; z\in
{\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

In the rest of this Section, we prove Theorem \ref{2Th3}.


\subsection{The estimates}

We provide an exponential expansion of the theta function, which is useful in our estimates.
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma31}  We have the following  exponential expansion of theta function:
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{PPP3}
\theta (\alpha;z)=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)+\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};0).
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
In view of \eqref{TXY}, by Poisson Summation Formula, one has
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{PPP2}
\vartheta(X;Y)=X^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-\frac{\pi(n-Y)^2}{X}}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\theta (\alpha;z)&=\sum_{(m,n)\in\mathbb{Z}^2} e^{-\alpha \pi\frac{1}{y }|nz+m|^2}
=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\sum_{m\in\mathbb{Z}} e^{-\frac{\alpha \pi (nx+m)^2}{y}}\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};-nx)=\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\\
&=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)+\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};0).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma32} We have the following  identity for derivative of the theta function with respect to $x$
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big(
\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)
\big)
=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}e^{-\pi\alpha y}\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z):
=
\sqrt2\sum_{n=1}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\big)-\beta\sum_{n=1}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};nx)\big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} By Lemma \ref{Lemma31},
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\big(
\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)
\big)
&=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\Big(
2\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)
-2\beta\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-2\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};nx)
\Big)\\
&=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}e^{-\pi\alpha y}(-\frac{\partial}{\partial x})
\Big(
\sqrt2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\\
&\;\;\;\;-\beta\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};nx)
\Big)\\
&=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}e^{-\pi\alpha y}
\Big(
\sqrt2\sum_{n=1}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\big)\\
&\;\;\;\;-\beta\sum_{n=1}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};nx)\big)
\Big)\\
&=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}e^{-\pi\alpha y}\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma33} For $x\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$, $z\in\overline{\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}$,
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)\geq
\sin(2\pi x)

 \sqrt2\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})
 -(\beta+\sigma_2) e^{-\alpha\pi y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})-(4\sqrt2e^{-3\alpha\pi y}+\sigma_1)\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})
 \Big),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
 \begin{equation}\label{sigma12} \aligned
\sigma_1:=\sqrt2\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2e^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)},
\sigma_2:=\beta\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2e^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}.
\endaligned\end{equation}



\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}


We decompose

 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z):
=&\sqrt2(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y})\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};x)-be^{-\pi\alpha y}(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y})\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};x)

&+\sqrt2\sum_{n=2}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\big)
-\beta\sum_{n=2}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\big(-\frac{\partial}{\partial Y}\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha};nx)\big)\\
=&\mathcal{E}^{a,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)+\mathcal{E}^{b,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z).
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{E}^{a,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)$ and $\mathcal{E}^{b,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)$ are defined at the last equality.

For $\mathcal{E}^{b,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)$ we estimate as follows
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
|\mathcal{E}^{b,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)|
&\leq\sqrt2\sum_{n=2}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})|\sin(2\pi nx)|
+\beta\sum_{n=2}^\infty ne^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})|\sin(2\pi nx)|\\
&\leq\sqrt2\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2e^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})\sin(2\pi x)
+\beta\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2e^{-\alpha\pi y(2n^2-1)}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})\sin(2\pi x)\\
&\leq\sigma_1\cdot\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})\sin(2\pi x)
+\sigma_2\cdot\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})\sin(2\pi x),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are defined at (\ref{sigma12}).


For $\mathcal{E}^{b,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)$  we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{E}^{a,1}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)
&\geq\sqrt2\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})\sin(2\pi x)-\beta e^{-\pi\alpha y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})\sin(2\pi x)
+2\sqrt2e^{-3\pi\alpha y}\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})\sin(4\pi x)\\
&\geq\sin(2\pi x)\Big(\sqrt2\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})-\beta e^{-\pi\alpha y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Therefore,
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned

\geq&\sin(2\pi x)

\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{proof}

\subsection{The estimates of the lower bound of a useful function and completing of the proof}

\vskip0.2in
In view of Lemma \ref{Lemma33} and \ref{Lemma34}. We
define
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha,\beta}(y):
=
 \Big(
 \sqrt2\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})
 -\beta e^{-\alpha\pi y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})-4\sqrt2e^{-3\alpha\pi y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})

\endaligned\end{equation}

\begin{lemma}\label{Rab} For $\beta<\beta_0$, and $\forall\alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$,
$$
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha,\beta}(y)>0.
$$

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} We divide its proof to three cases.

\noindent
 {\bf Case A: $\frac{y}{\alpha},\frac{y}{2\alpha}\in(0,\frac{1}{4}]$.} In this case, $\alpha\geq4y\geq2\sqrt3$.
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha,\beta}(y)&
=
 \Big(
 \sqrt2\underline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})
 -\beta e^{-\alpha\pi y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{2\alpha})-4\sqrt2e^{-3\alpha\pi y}\overline\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha})
 \Big)\\
 &\geq
 \sqrt2\pi e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}}(\frac{y}{\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}-\beta e^{-\pi\alpha y}(\frac{y}{2\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}
 -4\sqrt2 e^{-3\pi\alpha y}(\frac{y}{\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}\\
 &=
 e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}}(\frac{y}{\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}
 \Big(
 \sqrt2\pi-2\sqrt2\beta e^{-\pi\alpha(y-\frac{1}{4y})}-4\sqrt2e^{-\pi\alpha(3y-\frac{1}{4y})}

\endaligned\end{equation}
Trivially $y-\frac{1}{4y}\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{3}$ and $3y-\frac{1}{4y}\geq\frac{4\sqrt3}{3}$ since $y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$.
Hence
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha,\beta}(y)
 &\geq
 e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}}(\frac{y}{\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}
 \Big(
 \sqrt2\pi-2\sqrt2\beta e^{-\pi\alpha(y-\frac{1}{4y})}-4\sqrt2e^{-\pi\alpha(3y-\frac{1}{4y})}
 \Big)\\
 &\geq
 e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}}(\frac{y}{\alpha})^{-\frac{3}{2}}
 \Big(
 \sqrt2\pi-2\sqrt2\beta e^{-\pi\alpha\frac{\sqrt3}{3}}-4\sqrt2 e^{-\pi\alpha\frac{4\sqrt3}{3}}

 {\bf Case C: $\frac{y}{\alpha}\in[\frac{1}{4},\infty),\frac{y}{2\alpha}\in(0,\frac{1}{4}]$.} In this case, $2y\leq\alpha\leq4y$ and we have

\end{proof}



Finally we complete the proof of Theorem \ref{2Th3}.

\begin{proof}
Combining Lemma \ref{Rab} with Lemmas \ref{Lemma33} and \ref{Lemma34}, yield that
 \begin{equation}\label{Positive}\aligned
\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)
\begin{cases}
>0,\;\;\hbox{for}\;\; x\in(0,\frac{1}{3}), \alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2},\\
>0,\;\;\hbox{for}\;\; x\in[\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}), \alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2},
\end{cases}
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)$ is defined in Lemma \ref{Lemma32}.

Since trivially
 \begin{equation}\label{Positive2}\aligned
{\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}\subseteq\Big(\{z|: x\in[0,\frac{1}{3}], y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}\}\cup\{z|: x\in[\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}], y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}\}\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
\eqref{Positive} and \eqref{Positive2} yield
\begin{equation}\label{Positive3}\aligned
\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta,x}(z)
>0,\;\;\hbox{for}\;\; \alpha\geq1\;\;\hbox{and}\;\;z\in {\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{G}}}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Therefore, \eqref{Positive3} and Lemma \ref{Lemma32} complete the proof of Theorem \ref{2Th3}.



\end{proof}



\section{The monotonicity on the vertical line $y=\frac{1}{2}$ and proof of Theorem \ref{Th1}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

In Theorem \ref{2Th1}, we have established that for $\alpha\geq1, \beta<\beta_0\cong3.8$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{3hhh}
\min_{z\in\mathbb{H}}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)
=\min_{z\in\Gamma}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is a vertical line and defined at \eqref{Gfff}.

The following Lemma, which proves the non-existence part of Theorem \ref{Th1},  shows  that one only needs to consider the minimum of $\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)$
for $\beta\leq\sqrt2$.
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma41} The minimum of $\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)$ does not exist if $\beta>\sqrt2$.
\end{lemma}

We postpone the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma41} to the late section.  Combining \eqref{3hhh} of  Theorem \ref{2Th1} and Lemma \ref{Lemma41}, it suffices to consider minimization problem on a vertical line $\Gamma$ for $\beta\leq\sqrt2$. For this, we establish the following, which proves the first part of Theorem \ref{Th1}.

\begin{theorem}\label{4Th1} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. For $\beta\leq\sqrt2$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\min_{z\in\Gamma}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)\;\;\hbox{is achieved uniquely at }\;\;\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{theorem}


Since $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)\geq0$ for $y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ with equality attained at $\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ $($\cite{Mon1988}$)$, it suffices to prove
the critical case of Theorem \ref{4Th1}, namely,
\begin{theorem}\label{4Th2} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$ and $\beta=\sqrt{2}$. Then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\min_{z\in\Gamma}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)\;\;\hbox{is achieved uniquely at }\;\;\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

In the rest of this section, we aim to prove Theorem \ref{4Th2} (which is a consequence of  Lemma \ref{Lemma44} and \ref{Lemma46}). Due to its difficulty and complexity, we shall divide its proof into two cases.

We first establish the following
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma42} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$ and $y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$.
 Then we have the following  lower bound  estimate
 \begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\Big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\Big)
\geq\frac{2(\pi\alpha)^2}{y^4}e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{www111}
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha):=1+(2(y^2-\frac{1}{4})^2-\frac{4}{\pi\alpha}y^3\cdot(1+\epsilon_{a}))\cdot e^{-\pi\alpha (y-\frac{3}{4y})}
-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_{b})\cdot e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here $\epsilon_a$ is small and can be explicitly controlled by
$$
\epsilon_a:=\epsilon_{a,1}+\epsilon_{a,2}+\epsilon_{a,3}+\epsilon_{a,4}.
$$
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_a\rightarrow0\;\;\hbox{as}\;\;y\mapsto\infty.
\endaligned\end{equation}

Here each $\epsilon_{a,j}(j=1,2,3,4)$ is small and expressed by
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_{a,1}:&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty(2n-1)^2 e^{-\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)}\\
\epsilon_{a,2}:&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}((2n-1)^2-1)}\\
\epsilon_{a,3}:&=\epsilon_{a,1}\cdot\epsilon_{a,2}\\
\epsilon_{a,4}:&=2 e^{-\pi\alpha(3y-\frac{1}{4y})}\big(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-4\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)}\big)\cdot\vartheta_3(\frac{\alpha}{y})
.
\endaligned\end{equation}
And $\epsilon_b$ is small and consist of four smaller parts
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_b:=\epsilon_{b,1}+\epsilon_{b,2}+\epsilon_{b,3}+\epsilon_{b,4},
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_b\rightarrow0\;\;\hbox{as}\;\;y\mapsto\infty.
\endaligned\end{equation}


Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_{b,1}
:&=2y^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})\cdot
(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty(2n-1)^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y ((2n-1)^2-1)})\\
\epsilon_{b,2}
:&=\frac{1}{8}e^{-2\pi\alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^4 e^{-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})
\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-2\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)})\\
\epsilon_{b,3}
:&=16y^4 e^{-\pi \alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^4e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})\cdot(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2})\\
\epsilon_{b,4}
:&=y^4 e^{-\pi \alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})\cdot(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^4}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2}).
\endaligned\end{equation}


\end{lemma}

An elementary estimate of $\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)$ in Lemma \ref{Lemma42}, we obtain
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma43} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $y\in[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},1.8\alpha]$,


\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\Big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\Big)
>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

In view of Lemma \ref{Lemma43}, one has
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma44} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $y\in[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},1.8\alpha]$,


\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\Big)
>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{proof} The proof follows from Lemma \ref{Lemma43}. In fact
it suffices to notice that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
&\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(y^{-2}\Big(
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\big)
\Big)\Big)\\
=&\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\Big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\Big)
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\Big(
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)\big)
\Big)\mid_{y=\frac{\sqrt3}{2}}=0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma45} The following estimates hold
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta (\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta (2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)
\Big)&\geq
\frac{2}{\sqrt{y\alpha}}e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot \mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha):=\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}
-ye^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-ye^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha):=\sigma_5+\sigma_6+\sigma_7.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sigma_5:&=
\frac{1}{2y}\big(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha}))\big)(1+\nu(y\alpha))\\
\sigma_6:&=\alpha\pi(1+\mu(y\alpha))(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha})))\\
\sigma_7:&=\frac{2\pi}{\alpha}e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(y\alpha))(1+\mu(\frac{y}{\alpha})).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mu(y):&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-\pi y(n^2-1)}\\
\nu(y):&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty  e^{-\pi y(n^2-1)}
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
Based on Lemma \ref{Lemma45}, an elementary analysis of $\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)$ yields

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma46} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $y\in[1.15\alpha,\infty]$,

\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta (\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta (2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)
\Big)>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
Trivially, for $\alpha\geq1$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},\infty)\subseteq[\frac{\sqrt3}{2}, 1.8\alpha]\cup[1.15\alpha,\infty)
\endaligned\end{equation}
then Lemmas \ref{Lemma46} and \ref{Lemma44} complete the proof of Theorem \ref{4Th2}.

In the rest of this Section, we provide the proof of Lemmas \ref{Lemma46} and \ref{Lemma44}.

\subsection{Some basic identities}

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma47} The following identity for $\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;z)\big)$ holds
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)&\big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;z)\big)=(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}\\
&+\frac{4\sqrt2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}\\
&-4\sqrt2(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2})^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} By definition of the theta function (\ref{thetas}), we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\theta(\alpha;z)=\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m} n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
-\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m} \frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2}e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
 \begin{equation}\label{Th471}\aligned
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\theta(\alpha;z)=&(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
\\&-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m} n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
The identity follows by \eqref{Th471}.

\end{proof}

Similar to the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma47} (the details are omit here), one has
\begin{lemma} It holds
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;z)\big)&=\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m}\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2}e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
+2\sqrt2\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}\\
&-\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
-2\sqrt2\pi\alpha\sum_{n,m}\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y^2}e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+nx)^2}{y})}
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}







\subsection{The analysis of $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta(\alpha;z)-\sqrt2 \theta(2\alpha;z)\Big)$}

 We use the following expression of theta function, which is a variant of Lemma \ref{Lemma31}.
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma409} A variant expression of $\theta (\alpha;z)$ is the following
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{PPP3}
\theta (\alpha;z)&=2\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi yn^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)+\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{\alpha})\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\big(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\big)+2\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}


Now we give the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma41}:

\begin{proof} In view of Lemma \ref{Lemma409}, one has
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\theta (\alpha;z)&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{\alpha}}\cdot\big(
1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}+2e^{-\alpha\pi y}+o(e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}})+o(e^{-\alpha\pi y})
\big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\theta (\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)
&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot\Big(
\sqrt2-\beta+2\sqrt2 e^{-\pi\alpha y}-2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}+o(e^{-\pi\alpha y})+o(e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}})
\Big),\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot\Big(
\sqrt2-\beta+o(1)
\Big)
\endaligned\end{equation}
Therefore, for $\forall\alpha>0$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\theta (\alpha;z)-\beta\theta(2\alpha;z)
&=\sqrt{\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot\Big(
\sqrt2-\beta+o(1)
\Big)\\
&\mapsto -\infty,\;\;\;\hbox{if}\;\;\;\beta>\sqrt2,
\endaligned\end{equation}
proves the nonexistence result.





\end{proof}



In the next two lemmas(Lemmas \ref{Lemma410} and \ref{Lemma411}), we analyze the two parts of $\theta(\alpha;z)$ in Lemma \ref{Lemma409}.



\begin{lemma}[Analysis of second part arising from Lemma \ref{Lemma409}]\label{Lemma410}Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq\frac{4}{5}$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\Big(
\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{\alpha})-\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{2\alpha})
\Big)\Big)>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}


\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} By a straightforward computation, we have

\begin{equation}\aligned\label{gggjjj}
&\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\Big(
\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{\alpha})-\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{2\alpha})
\Big)\Big)\\
=&2\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \big(e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}-e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\big)
\Big)\\
=&
\frac{2}{\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\Big(
(\frac{n^2\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{n^2\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{n^2\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
\Big)
\endaligned\end{equation}
Since $\alpha\geq1,\;\;\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq\frac{4}{5}$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
(\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
&\geq(\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\pi-\frac{1}{2})\\
&>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Therefore, since each term in the sum of \eqref{gggjjj} is positive, the result then follows.
\end{proof}


To control the error terms, we recall
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mu(y):&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-\pi y(n^2-1)}\\
\nu(y):&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty  e^{-\pi y(n^2-1)}
\endaligned\end{equation}


\begin{lemma} [The estimate of first part in Lemma \ref{Lemma409}]\label{Lemma411}

\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\Big)
\leq
\sqrt{y}e^{-\pi y\alpha}\cdot \mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
\endaligned\end{equation}
where the $\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)$ can be controlled by some constant and is expressed by


\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha):=\sigma_5+\sigma_6+\sigma_7,
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)<\alpha\pi,\;\hbox{as}\;\; y\rightarrow\infty.
\endaligned\end{equation}

Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sigma_5:&=
\frac{1}{2y}\big(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha}))\big)(1+\nu(y\alpha))\\
\sigma_6:&=\alpha\pi(1+\mu(y\alpha))(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha})))\\
\sigma_7:&=\frac{2\pi}{\alpha}e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(y\alpha))(1+\mu(\frac{y}{\alpha})).
\endaligned\end{equation}


\end{lemma}
\begin{remark} Lemma \ref{Lemma411} shows that
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\Big)$$
is small in related estimates.

\end{remark}


\begin{proof}  A direct calculation shows that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\Big)
=&\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)
+\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-\alpha\pi y) e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\\
&+\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-\alpha\pi y) e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx).
\endaligned\end{equation}
For convenience, we denote that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
I_1:=&\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\\
I_2:=&\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-\alpha\pi n^2) e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\\
I_3:=&\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{4I123}
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)\Big)
=I_1+I_2+I_3.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Next, we estimate $I_j,j=1,2,3$ in order.
For $I_1$,

\begin{equation}\aligned\label{4I1}
|I_1|&=|\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)|\\
&\leq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}|\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)|\\
&\leq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi \frac{y}{\alpha}})\\
&=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} e^{-\alpha\pi y}\big(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\big)\cdot\big(
1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}(n^2-1)})
\big)\\
&=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{y}} e^{-\alpha\pi y}\big(
1+\nu(y\alpha)
\big)\big(
1+2 e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha}))
\big).
\endaligned\end{equation}


And $I_2$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{4I2}
|I_2|&=|\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-\alpha\pi n^2) e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)|\\
&\leq\alpha\pi\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}|\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)|\\
&\leq\alpha\pi\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\vartheta_3(\frac{y}{\alpha})\\
&=\alpha\pi\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\big(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\pi n^2\frac{y}{\alpha}}\big)\\
&=\alpha\pi\sqrt{y} e^{-\alpha\pi y}\big(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y (n^2-1)} \big)\cdot
\big(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\pi (n^2-1)\frac{y}{\alpha}})\big)\\
&=\alpha\pi\sqrt{y} e^{-\alpha\pi y}\big(1+\mu(y\alpha) \big)\cdot
\big(1+2e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}(1+\nu(\frac{y}{\alpha}))\big).
\endaligned\end{equation}


The $I_3$ is estimated by
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{4I3}
|I_3|=&|\sqrt{y}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial}{\partial X}\vartheta(\frac{y}{\alpha};nx)|\\
\leq&2\pi\sqrt{y}\frac{1}{\alpha}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\alpha \pi y n^2}\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 e^{-\pi n^2\frac{y}{\alpha}}\\
=&\frac{2}{\alpha}\pi\sqrt{y} e^{-\alpha\pi y} e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\big(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\alpha\pi y(n^2-1)}\big)
\cdot\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-\pi (n^2-1)\frac{y}{\alpha}}\\
=&\frac{2}{\alpha}\pi\sqrt{y} e^{-\pi y(\alpha+\frac{1}{\alpha})}\cdot(1+\nu(y\alpha))\cdot(1+\mu(\frac{y}{\alpha})).
\endaligned\end{equation}

The \eqref{4I123} togethers with \eqref{4I1}, \eqref{4I2} and \eqref{4I3} yield the result.

The following lemma is a variant of Lemma \ref{Lemma45}.

\begin{lemma} \label{Lemmalower}
 Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq\frac{4}{5}$, then it holds
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta (\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta (2\alpha;z)
\Big)&\geq
\frac{2}{\sqrt{y\alpha}}e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot \mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha):=\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}
-ye^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-ye^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha),
\endaligned\end{equation}
and $\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)$ is introduced in Lemma \ref{Lemma411}.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof} By Lemmas \ref{Lemma409}, \ref{Lemma410} and \ref{Lemma411},
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Lhhh}
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha}}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big(\theta (\alpha;z)-\sqrt2\theta (2\alpha;z)
\Big)&\geq
\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\Big(
(\frac{n^2\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{n^2\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{n^2\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
\Big)\\
&
-\sqrt{y} e^{-\pi y\alpha}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-\sqrt{y} e^{-2\pi y\alpha}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}} e^{-\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\Big(
(\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
\Big)\\
&
-\sqrt{y} e^{-\pi y\alpha}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-\sqrt{y} e^{-2\pi y\alpha}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)\\
&+\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\Big(
(\frac{n^2\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{n^2\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{n^2\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
\Big)\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}\cdot \mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)+\mathcal{R}_0(y;\alpha).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{R}_0(y;\alpha):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-n^2\pi\frac{y}{\alpha}}\Big(
(\frac{n^2\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{n^2\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{n^2\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Since $\alpha\geq1,\;\;\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq\frac{4}{5}$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
(\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\frac{\pi }{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})
&\geq(\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2})e^{\pi \frac{y}{2\alpha}}-(\pi-\frac{1}{2})\\
&>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}

Then trivially,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{R}_0(y;\alpha)>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then the estimate follows by \eqref{Lhhh}.

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[The upper bounds of $y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)$ and $y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)$]\label{Lemma413a} Assume that $\alpha\geq1 , y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$. If $\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq1$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)&\leq4.232412\cdots,\\
y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)&\leq10.268696\cdots.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} In view of the expression $y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha), y\cdot\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)$. The only technical part is to control
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\alpha y e^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})},  \alpha y e^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
These two terms are similar. We estimate by
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{hhh000}
\alpha y e^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}
&=\alpha^2\cdot\frac{y}{\alpha}e^{-\pi \alpha^2\cdot \frac{y}{\alpha}\cdot(1-\frac{1}{2\alpha^2})}\\
&\geq\frac{y}{\alpha}e^{-\pi \frac{y}{\alpha}\cdot(1-\frac{1}{2\alpha^2})},
\endaligned\end{equation}
where we shall control the growth of $\alpha$ by the monotonically decreasing of $xe^{-A\cdot x}$ as $x\geq\frac{1}{A}$.
Similar to \eqref{hhh000}
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{hhh111}
\alpha y e^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}
\geq\frac{y}{\alpha}e^{-\pi \frac{y}{\alpha}\cdot(2-\frac{1}{2\alpha^2})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then we can view $\frac{y}{\alpha}$ as an variable in estimates.
The rest of estimate using the decreasing of $\mu,\nu$. Namely,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
&\mu(y\alpha)\leq\mu(\frac{\sqrt3}{2}), \mu(y\alpha)\leq\mu(1);\\
&\nu(y\alpha)\leq\nu(\frac{\sqrt3}{2}), \nu(y\alpha)\leq\nu(1).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here $\alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ and $\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq1$ used.
\end{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma4L} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$, if $\frac{y}{\alpha}\geq1.15$, then
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)>0,
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)=\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}
-ye^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-ye^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)
\endaligned\end{equation}
 is defined in Lemma \ref{Lemmalower}.
\end{lemma}



\begin{proof} The proof follows from Lemma \ref{Lemma413a}:
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{qqq111}
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)&=\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}
-ye^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;\alpha)
-ye^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\mathcal{P}(y;2\alpha)\\
&\geq\frac{\pi y}{2\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\pi-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\pi\frac{y}{2\alpha}}
-4.5e^{-\pi y(\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}
-10.5e^{-\pi y(2\alpha-\frac{1}{2\alpha})}\\
&=\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\pi-\frac{1}{2}) e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}}
-4.5e^{-\alpha^2\cdot\pi \frac{y}{\alpha}(1-\frac{1}{2\alpha^2})}
-10.5e^{-\alpha^2\cdot\pi \frac{y}{\alpha}(2-\frac{1}{2\alpha^2})}\\
&\geq\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\pi+4) e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}}
-10.5e^{-\frac{3\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}},
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\alpha\geq1$ is used.
Next, a simple calculation shows that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\frac{\pi}{2}\cdot x -\frac{1}{2}-(\pi+4) e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\cdot x}
-10.5e^{-\frac{3\pi}{2}\cdot x}>0\Leftrightarrow x>1.126371\cdots.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then by \eqref{qqq111},
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{qqq111}
\mathcal{Q}(y;\alpha)
&\geq\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{2}-(\pi+4) e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}}
-10.5e^{-\frac{3\pi}{2}\frac{y}{\alpha}}\\
&>0\;\;\;\;\hbox{if}\;\;\;\; \frac{y}{\alpha}>1.126371\cdots,
\endaligned\end{equation}
yields the result.

\subsection{The estimates of $(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y})\Big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)-\sqrt2\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)\Big)$}

The following Lemma is a particular case of Lemma \ref{Lemma47}, our analysis relies on this expression.
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma413} The identity for $\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)\big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)\big)$ holds
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)&\big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)\big)=(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
&+\frac{4\sqrt2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
&-4\sqrt2(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
There are two types of double sums appeared in Lemma \ref{Lemma413}$($with slightly different frequencies$)$, as follows
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{gghh}
\hbox{double sum A}:&=\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}, \\
\hbox{double sum B}:&=\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

We shall estimate these two double sums of \eqref{gghh} in Lemmas \ref{Lemma414} and \ref{Lemma415}.


\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma414} We have the following  upper bound function of $\sum_{n,m}n^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}$:
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sum_{n,m}n^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\leq4e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\cdot\big(1+\epsilon_a\big),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_a$ is small and can be explicitly controlled by
$$
\epsilon_a:=\epsilon_{a,1}+\epsilon_{a,2}+\epsilon_{a,3}+\epsilon_{a,4}
$$
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_a\rightarrow0\;\;\hbox{as}\;\;y\mapsto\infty.
\endaligned\end{equation}

Here each $\epsilon_{a,j}(j=1,2,3,4)$ is small and expressed by
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_{a,1}:&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty(2n-1)^2 e^{-\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)}\\
\epsilon_{a,2}:&=\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}((2n-1)^2-1)}\\
\epsilon_{a,3}:&=\epsilon_{a,1}\cdot\epsilon_{a,2}\\
\epsilon_{a,4}:&=2 e^{-\pi\alpha(3y-\frac{1}{4y})}\big(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-4\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)}\big)\cdot\vartheta_3(\frac{\alpha}{y})
.
\endaligned\end{equation}


\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We shall divide the sum into two parts,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sum_{n,m}n^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}\\
&=\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}+\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
For convenience, we denote that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
J_1:&=\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})},\\
 J_2:&=\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{J1J2g}
\sum_{n,m}n^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
=J_1+J_2.
\endaligned\end{equation}

We  now estimate $J_1$ and $J_2$ respectively. First $J_1$ can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{J1g}
J_1=&\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}
=\sum_{p=2n,q=2m}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}\\
=&4\sum_{n}n^2 e^{-4\pi\alpha y n^2}\sum_m e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2}
=8\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^2 e^{-4\pi\alpha yn^2}\cdot(1+2\sum_{m=1}^\infty e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2})\\
=& 8e^{-4\pi\alpha y}(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^2 e^{-4\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})\cdot(1+2\sum_{m=1}^\infty e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2})\\
=&4 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\cdot \epsilon_{a,4},
\endaligned\end{equation}
as we can see later, $J_1$ is the remainder terms.

Next $J_2$ can be deformed as
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{J2g}
J_2=&\sum_{p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}
=\sum_{p=2n-1,q=2m-1}p^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(yp^2+\frac{q^2}{4y})}\\
=&4\sum_{n=1}^\infty (2n-1)^2 e^{-\pi\alpha y(2n-1)^2}\cdot\sum_{m=1}^\infty e^{-\pi\alpha\frac{(2m-1)^2}{4y}}\\
=&4 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^2 e^{-\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)})
\cdot(1+\sum_{m=2}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi\alpha}{4y}((2m-1)^2-1)})\\
=&4 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\cdot(1+\epsilon_{a,1}+\epsilon_{a,2}+\epsilon_{a,1}\cdot\epsilon_{a,2})\\
=&4 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\cdot(1+\epsilon_{a,1}+\epsilon_{a,2}+\epsilon_{a,3}).
\endaligned\end{equation}

The result follows by \eqref{J1J2g}, \eqref{J1g} and \eqref{J2g}.



\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma415} We have the following  upper bound
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sum_{n,m}(n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\leq
\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot(1+\epsilon_b),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_b$ is small and consist of four smaller parts
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_b:=\epsilon_{b,1}+\epsilon_{b,2}+\epsilon_{b,3}+\epsilon_{b,4},
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_b\rightarrow0\;\;\hbox{as}\;\;y\mapsto\infty.
\endaligned\end{equation}


Here
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\epsilon_{b,1}
:&=2y^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})\cdot
(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y ((2n-1)^2-1)})\\
\epsilon_{b,2}
:&=\frac{1}{8}e^{-2\pi\alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^4 e^{-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})
\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-2\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)})\\
\epsilon_{b,3}
:&=16y^4 e^{-\pi \alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^4e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})\cdot(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2})\\
\epsilon_{b,4}
:&=y^4 e^{-\pi \alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})\cdot(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^4}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2}).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
We shall divide the sum into two different parts as follows
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
&\sum_{n,m}(n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}\\
&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}\\
&+\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

For convenience, one denotes that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_a:&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})},\\
\mathcal{K}_b:&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Hence we have
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\sum_{n,m}(n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
=\mathcal{K}_a+\mathcal{K}_b.
\endaligned\end{equation}
One deforms $\mathcal{K}_a$ and $\mathcal{K}_b$ respectively:
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_a&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv0(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}\\
&=\sum_{n,m}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}
\endaligned\end{equation}
To leading order, we single out the major terms by regrouping the terms as follows
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_a
&=\sum_{n,m}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}
+\sum_{n\not\in\{0\},m}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;+\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
To further simplify the structure, one denotes that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_{a,1}:&=\sum_{n\not\in\{0\},m}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})},\\
\mathcal{K}_{a,2}:&=\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Then,
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{Ka}
\mathcal{K}_a=
\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}
+\mathcal{K}_{a,1}+\mathcal{K}_{a,2}
\endaligned\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{minus}
\sum_{n,m}(n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}
+\mathcal{K}_{a,1}+\mathcal{K}_{a,2}+\mathcal{K}_b.
\endaligned\end{equation}
To control $\mathcal{K}_{a,j}, j=1,2$, we use a basic mean value inequality and
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_{a,1}&=\sum_{n\not\in\{0\},m}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&\leq\sum_{n\not\in\{0\},m}16n^4e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}+\sum_{n\not\in\{0\},m}\frac{m^4}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&=32\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^4e^{-8\pi\alpha y n^2}\sum_m e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2}
+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-8\pi\alpha y n^2}\sum_m \frac{m^4}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2}\\
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot \sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1},
\endaligned\end{equation}
where we single  out the small remainder terms denoted by $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}}$ as follows
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{K1}
 \sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1}
 :&=
 16y^4 e^{-\pi\alpha(8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot (1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^4 e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})
 \cdot (1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2})\\
 &+ e^{-\pi\alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}
 \cdot (1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-8\pi\alpha y(n^2-1)})
 \cdot (1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^4e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}n^2})
\endaligned\end{equation}
Similar to $\mathcal{K}_{a,2}$,
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{K}_{a,2}&=\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n}(4n^2-\frac{m^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&\leq\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n} 16n^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}
+\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n} \frac{m^4}{y^4} e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&\leq\sum_{m,n} 16n^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}
+\sum_{m\not\in\{-1,1\},n} \frac{m^4}{y^4} e^{-2\pi\alpha(4n^2 y+\frac{m^2}{y})}\\
&\leq32\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^4 e^{-8\pi\alpha y n^2}\sum_{m} e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2}
+2\sum_{m=2}^\infty \frac{m^4}{y^4} e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2}\sum_{n} e^{-8\pi\alpha y n^2}\\
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot \sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2},
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{K2}
\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2}&=16e^{-\pi\alpha (8y-\frac{2}{y})}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty n^4 e^{-8\pi\alpha y (n^2-1)})\cdot
(1+2\sum_{m=1}^\infty e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}m^2})\\
&\;+\sum_{m=2}^\infty m^4 e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}(m^2-1)}\cdot(1+2\sum_{m=1}^\infty e^{-8\pi\alpha y n^2}).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Recall in \eqref{Ka}, one has
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{kka}
\mathcal{K}_a&=
\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}
+\mathcal{K}_{a,1}+\mathcal{K}_{a,2}
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot(1+\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1}+\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2}),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2}$ are defined in \eqref{K1} and \eqref{K2} respectively.

Next, we estimate $\mathcal{K}_b$.
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{kkb}
\mathcal{K}_b&=\sum_{p,q,p\equiv q\equiv1(mod2)}(p^2-\frac{q^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yp^2+\frac{q^2}{y})}\\
&=\sum_{n,m}((2n-1)^2-\frac{(2m-1)^2}{4y^2})^2e^{-2\pi\alpha (y(2n-1)^2+\frac{(2m-1)^2}{y})}\\
&\leq\sum_{n,m}(2n-1)^4e^{-2\pi\alpha (y(2n-1)^2+\frac{(2m-1)^2}{y})}
+\sum_{n,m}\frac{(2m-1)^4}{16y^4}e^{-2\pi\alpha (y(2n-1)^2+\frac{(2m-1)^2}{y})}\\
&=\sum_m e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}(2m-1)^2}\cdot\sum_n (2n-1)^4e^{-2\pi\alpha y(2n-1)^2}\\
&\;\;\;+\sum_m \frac{(2m-1)^4}{16y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}(2m-1)^2}\cdot\sum_n e^{-2\pi\alpha y(2n-1)^2}\\
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot \sigma_{\mathcal{K}_3},
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{K3}
 \sigma_{\mathcal{K}_3}:=2y^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})
 \cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^4 e^{-2\pi\alpha y((2n-1)^2-1)})\\
 +\frac{1}{8}e^{-2\pi \alpha y}\cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty (2n-1)^4 e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}((2n-1)^2-1)})
 \cdot(1+\sum_{n=2}^\infty  e^{-2\pi \alpha y ((2n-1)^2-1)}).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{minus} with \eqref{kka} and \eqref{kkb}, one deduces that
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{minusaaa}
\sum_{n,m}(n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2 e^{-2\pi\alpha (yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
&=\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}
+\mathcal{K}_{a,1}+\mathcal{K}_{a,2}+\mathcal{K}_b\\
&\leq\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot(1+\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1}+\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2}+\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_3}),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_1}$, $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_2}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{K}_3}$ are defined in
\eqref{K1}, \eqref{K2} and \eqref{K3} respectively. The inequality \eqref{minusaaa} yields the result.


\end{proof}

The next two Lemmas provide the lower bound functions of the double sums in Lemma \ref{Lemma413}, where the positiveness is used effectively.

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma416} A lower bound function of the double sum $\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}$ is as follows
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
\geq\frac{2}{y^4} e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}+4(1-\frac{1}{4y^2})^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
\begin{remark} In the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma416}$($and Lemma \ref{Lemma417} below$)$, we have used the positive structure of the double sum.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof} The double sum evaluates at
$$(m,n)=\{(1,0),(-1,0)\}
\;\;\hbox{contributing}\;\;\frac{1}{y^4} e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\;\;\hbox{each}
$$
and
$$(m,n)=\{(0,1),(0,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1)\}
\;\;\hbox{contributing}\;\;(1-\frac{1}{4y^2})^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\;\;\hbox{each}.
$$
The rest of other terms in the double sum all are positive and hence the result follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma417}
A lower bound function of $\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}$ is
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
\geq4 e^{-2\pi\alpha (y+\frac{1}{4y})}.
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} The double sum can be evaluated at
$$(m,n)=\{(0,1),(0,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1)\}
\;\;\hbox{contributing}\;\; e^{-2\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\;\;\hbox{each}.
$$
The rest of other terms in the double sum all are positive and hence the result follows.

\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma418} We have the following   lower bound estimate

\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+iy))
\geq\frac{2(\pi\alpha)^2}{y^4}e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha),
\endaligned\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{www111}
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha):=1+(2(y^2-\frac{1}{4})^2-\frac{4}{\pi\alpha}y^3\cdot(1+\epsilon_{a}))\cdot e^{-\pi\alpha (y-\frac{3}{4y})}
-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_{b})\cdot e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here $\epsilon_{a}$ and $\epsilon_{b}$ are defined in Lemmas \ref{Lemma414} and \ref{Lemma415} respectively.
\end{lemma}




\begin{proof} In view of Lemma \ref{Lemma413}, combining with the bound functions in Lemmas \ref{Lemma414}-\ref{Lemma418}, we have
 \begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{2}{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\big)&\big(\theta(\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)-\sqrt2\theta(2\alpha;\frac{1}{2}+i y)\big)=(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
&+\frac{4\sqrt2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}
-\frac{2\pi\alpha}{y}\sum_{n,m}n^2e^{-\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
&-4\sqrt2(\pi\alpha)^2\sum_{n,m} (n^2-\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y^2})^2e^{-2\pi\alpha(yn^2+\frac{(m+\frac{n}{2})^2}{y})}\\
\geq&(\pi\alpha)^2\frac{2}{y^4}e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}+4(\pi\alpha)^2(1-\frac{1}{4y^2})^2 e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}
+\frac{16\sqrt2\pi\alpha}{y}e^{-2\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}\\
&\;\;-\frac{8\pi\alpha}{y}(1+\epsilon_a)e^{-\pi\alpha(y+\frac{1}{4y})}
-\frac{8\sqrt2(\pi\alpha)^2}{y^4}(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-2\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\\
\geq&\frac{2(\pi\alpha)^2}{y^4}e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}\cdot
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha).
\endaligned\end{equation}

\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma420} Assume that $\alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$. If $\frac{y}{\alpha}\leq3$, then
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\epsilon_a&=0.1264717\cdots<0.15,\\
\epsilon_b&=0.0054169\cdots<0.006.
\endaligned\end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} The terms of $\epsilon_a, \epsilon_b$ are exponentially decaying. One needs to use the fact that
$\alpha\geq1, y\geq\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ and $\frac{\alpha}{y}\geq\frac{1}{3}$. Note that the positive lower bounds of $\frac{\alpha}{y}$ and $\alpha y$ are used effectively to control the summation.

\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{Lemma421} A refined lower bound of $\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)$, which is defined in \eqref{www111}, is the following
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)\geq
\begin{cases}
1-(\frac{4(1+\epsilon_a)}{\pi}-\frac{9}{8})-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\pi},\;\hbox{if}\; y\in[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},1];\\
1-(\frac{4(1+\epsilon_a)}{\pi}y^3-2(y^2-\frac{1}{4})^2)\cdot e^{-\frac{\pi}{4}}-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\frac{1}{y_\epsilon}\pi},
\;\hbox{if}\; y\in[1,y_\epsilon],\\
1-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}},\;\;\hbox{if}\; y\in[y_\epsilon,\infty).
\end{cases}
\endaligned\end{equation}
Here $y_\epsilon$ is the unique root of
$$2(y^2-\frac{1}{4})^2-\frac{4}{\pi}y^3\cdot(1+\epsilon_{a})=0$$
on $[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},\infty)$. Numerically, $y_\epsilon\cong1.130998\cdots$.


\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The proof is based on the explicit expression of $\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)$ in Lemma \ref{Lemma418}. Each part of
$\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)$ is analyzed separately.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{Lemma422} Assume that $\alpha\geq1$. If $y\in[\frac{\sqrt3}{2},1.8\alpha]$, then
$$\mathcal{W}(y;\alpha)>0.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The proof follows from Lemma \ref{Lemma421}. Note that
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
1-(\frac{4(1+\epsilon_a)}{\pi}-\frac{9}{8})-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\pi}>0.414852\cdots>0\\
1-(\frac{4(1+\epsilon_a)}{\pi}y^3-2(y^2-\frac{1}{4})^2)\cdot e^{-\frac{\pi}{4}}-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\frac{1}{y_\epsilon}\pi}>0.491478\cdots,
\;\hbox{if}\; y\in[1,y_\epsilon],
\endaligned\end{equation}
and that
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
1-4\sqrt2(1+\epsilon_b) e^{-\pi\frac{\alpha}{y}}>0\;\;\hbox{if}\;\;\frac{\alpha}{y}>0.553493\cdots.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Next, a simple computation shows that
\begin{equation}\nonumber\aligned
\frac{\alpha}{y}>0.553493\cdots\Leftrightarrow y\leq(1.806707\cdots)\alpha.
\endaligned\end{equation}
In view of Lemma \ref{Lemma421}, the result then follows.

\end{proof}




\section{Proofs of Theorems \ref{Th2}-\ref{ThA} }
\setcounter{equation}{0}

\noindent
{\bf Proof of Theorem \ref{Th2}:} By Fourier transform, we have 
\begin{equation}\aligned\nonumber
\theta(\frac{1}{\alpha};z)=\alpha\cdot\theta({\alpha};z), \;\;\alpha>0.
\endaligned\end{equation}
Theorem \ref{Th2} is equivalent to Theorem \ref{Th1}.



\medskip


\noindent
{\bf Proof of Theorem \ref{Th3}-\ref{Th4}:} These two theorems are easy consequences of Theorems \ref{Th1}-\ref{Th2}.


\medskip



\noindent
{\bf Proof of Theorem \ref{ThA}:}  The proof is based on an effective iteration scheme.


\noindent
{\bf Case A: $\beta\leq(\sqrt2)^k$.} We use the scheme
\begin{equation}\aligned\label{KKK}
&\Big(\theta (\alpha; z)-\beta\theta (2^k\alpha; z)\Big)\\
=&\big((\sqrt2)^k-\beta\big)\theta (2^k \alpha; z)
+\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(\sqrt2)^n\Big(\theta (2^n\alpha; z)-\sqrt2\theta (2^{n+1}\alpha; z)\Big).
\endaligned\end{equation}
Note that all the coefficients in \eqref{KKK} are nonnegative. We apply Theorem \ref{Th1} on each term of \eqref{KKK} to arrive that the minimizer of $\Big(\theta (\alpha; z)-\beta\theta (2^k\alpha; z)\Big)$ is $\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt3}{2}$ again in this case.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Case B: $\beta>(\sqrt2)^k$.}
The proof of nonexistence of the minimizer is similar to that of Lemma \ref{Lemma41}.
