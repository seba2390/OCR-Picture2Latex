\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a way to use convex optimization in the field of parameter synthesis for parametric Markov models. Using our results, many NLP encodings of related problems now have a direct and efficient solution.

Future work will concern the integration of these methods into mature tools like \tool{PRISM} or \tool{PROPhESY} to enable large-scale benchmarking by state space reduction techniques and advanced data structures. Moreover, we will explore extensions to richer models like continuous-time Markov chains~\cite{katoen2016probabilistic}.
