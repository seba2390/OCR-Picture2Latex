Multi-objective verification problems of parametric Markov decision
processes under optimality criteria can be naturally expressed as
nonlinear programs. We observe that many of these computationally
demanding problems belong to the subclass of signomial programs.
This insight allows for a sequential optimization algorithm to
efficiently compute sound but possibly suboptimal solutions. Each stage
of this algorithm solves a geometric programming problem. These geometric
programs are obtained by convexifying the nonconvex constraints of the
original problem. 
Direct applications of the encodings as nonlinear programs are model repair and parameter synthesis.
% partitioning into safe and unsafe parts.
We demonstrate the scalability and quality of our
approach by well-known benchmarks.
