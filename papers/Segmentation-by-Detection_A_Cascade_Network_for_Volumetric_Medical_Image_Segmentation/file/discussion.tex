We proposed a cascade framework for volumetric segmentation, called segmentation-by-detection which introduced an attention mechanism. The framework consists of a detection module for precise localization and a segmentation module. Different from other volumetric segmentation method which took an entire volume as input, our method exploited the attention model obtained from the detection module simultaneously. It allowed the network to distill information from the potential object region which increased the efficiency as well as reduced the disrupt of the surrounding noise. 
The detection module can be replaced by a human interactive tool where human provides precise region proposals. This interactive system can achieve even better performance in segmentation.
% The detection module can be replaced by a manual detection which results in precise region proposals and achieve even better performance in segmentation. 
We will devote our effort on that in the future.
