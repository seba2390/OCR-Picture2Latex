\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The collection of network traffic data from consumer IoT devices has heretofore involved tedious manual interactions with devices in a laboratory setting or expensive crowdsourcing initiatives. In this paper, we present a novel method for automating the collection of IoT network traffic across a variety of user interactions and device behaviors: configuring a robotic arm to interact with physical user interface elements of IoT devices according to formalized permutation-based interaction sequences. 
We describe the steps required to implement this method, including applying inverse kinematics to obtain robotic arm movement parameters, physically enlarging IoT device buttons to improve interaction accuracy, and  
creating permutation-based interaction sequences to provide comprehensive coverage of possible user interface interactions. 

We apply this approach to two representative IoT devices, an Amazon Echo Show~5 and an Emerson Sensi Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat. 
We confirm its effectiveness through inspection of collected network traffic and by the successful creation of a machine learning model that can infer specific robot/device interactions from the collected traffic. 
This indicates that the collected data contains information about device behaviors that could be useful for network, security, or privacy analyses.

Compared to prior methods of IoT network data collection, our automated approach provides high interaction coverage and does not require tedious manual effort. Our method is readily adaptable to different consumer IoT devices and for testing multi-device interactions. 
We have made our source code and other reference materials needed for this approach publicly available for future research.
