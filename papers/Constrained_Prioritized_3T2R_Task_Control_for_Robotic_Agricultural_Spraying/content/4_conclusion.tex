\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
For the task of robotic agricultural spraying, and for robotic spraying in general, the position of the spraying frame is more important than its orientation to ensure satisfactory spray coverage. We propose a solution where constrained prioritized optimization is used for velocity and positional level 3T2R task control, which corresponds to continuous and selective agricultural spraying tasks, respectively. Prioritized task space control and prioritized positional inverse kinematics are described in detail. Positional inverse kinematics are solved using iterative constrained prioritized task space control. In the future work, the prioritized IK framework is planned to be expanded to allow for more task types, such as preferred joint positions, manipulability maximization task and others. Voxel based obstacle avoidance is also planned to be included. We plan to explore the applicability of the framework for different robot control tasks. Prioritized positional inverse kinematics could have a number of applications, most interesting ones including high dimensional floating base robotic systems, which could have a high number of prioritized conflicting tasks. The utility of the prioritized optimization described in this paper for trajectory planning also remains to be explored.
