%% Text of abstract

The Code O-SUKI-N 3D is an upgraded version of the 2D Code O-SUKI (Comput. Phys. Commun. 240, 83 (2019)). Code O-SUKI-N 3D is an integrated 3-dimensional (3D) simulation program system for fuel implosion, ignition and burning of a direct-drive nuclear-fusion pellet in heavy ion beam (HIB) inertial confinement fusion (HIF).The Code O-SUKI-N 3D consists of the three programs of Lagrangian fluid implosion program, data conversion program, and Euler fluid implosion, ignition and burning program. The Code O-SUKI-N 3D can also couple with the HIB illumination and energy deposition program of OK3 (Comput. Phys. Commun. 181, 1332 (2010)). The spherical target implosion 3D behavior is computed by the 3D Lagrangian fluid code until the time just before the void closure of the fuel implosion. After that, all the data by the Lagrangian implosion code are converted to the data for the 3D Eulerian code. In the 3D Euler code, the DT fuel compression at the stagnation, ignition and burning are computed. The Code O-SUKI-N 3D simulation system provides a capability to compute and to study the HIF target implosion dynamics.

Nuclear fusion energy would be energy source for society. In this paper we focus on heavy ion beam (HIB) inertial confinement fusion (HIF). A spherical mm-radius deuterium (D) - tritium (T) fuel pellet is irradiated by HIBs to be compressed to about a thousand times of the solid density. The DT fuel temperature reaches $\sim$5-10KeV for the ignition to release the fusion energy. The typical HIBs total input energy is several MJ, and the HIBs pulse length is about a few tens of ns. The O-SUKI-N 3D code system provides an integrated tool to simulate the HIF DT fuel pellet implosion, ignition and burning in 3 dimensions (3D). The O-SUKI-N 3D code system is an upgraded version of the Code O-SUKI (Comput. Phys. Commun. 240, 83 (2019)) which is a 2D implosion simulation system in HIF. The DT fuel is compressed to the high density, and so the DT fuel spatial deformation may be serious at the DT fuel stagnation. Therefore, the O-SUKI and O-SUKI-N 3D systems employ a Lagrangian fluid code first to simulate the DT fuel implosion phase until just before the stagnation. Then all the simulation data from the Lagrangian code are converted to them for the Euler fluid code, in which the DT fuel ignition and burning are simulated. \\

{\em Solution method:}     
In the two fluid codes (Lagrangian and Euler fluid codes) in the O-SUKI-N 3D system the three-temperature fluid model (J. Appl. Phys. 60, 898 (1986)) is employed to simulate the pellet dynamics in HIF.

  %Describe the method solution here.
{\em Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features:} The Lagrange code is weak against the spatial mesh deformation from nature of its numerical algorithm. When short-wavelength perturbations are imposed near the poles of the spherical target, the spatial meshes might crash and the computation run may stop. \\

\section{Conclusions}
We have developed and presented the O-SUKI-N 3D code, which is useful to simulate 3D spherical DT fuel target implosion in HIF. The O-SUKI-N code is an upgraded implosion simulation system from the 2D O-SUKI code, and consists of the Lagrangian fluid code, the data conversion from the Lagrangian code data to the Euler code data, and the Euler code. Near the void closure phase of the DT fuel implosion, the DT fuel spatial deformation is serious. At the stagnation phase the DT fuel is compressed to about a thousand times of the solid density. The O-SUKI-N 3D code would provide a useful tool for the integrated DT fuel target implosion simulation in HIF.
