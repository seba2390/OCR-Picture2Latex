\begin{IEEEImpStatement}
Federated learning (FL), which enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model without data centralization, preserves user privacy and has become increasingly prominent. Despite its advancement, FL's vulnerability to adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor threats, has become a critical concern. In FL, the aggregation server does not have direct access to the data, which makes it harder to find these sneaky attacks. This makes it very hard to keep the model's integrity without losing accuracy. To address this, we introduce Federation Layer Detection (FLD), an innovative model filtering approach designed to counteract backdoor attacks in FL. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that FLD effectively mitigates such attacks with minimal impact on the main task's performance, highlighting its potential as an effective defense mechanism in secure FL systems.
