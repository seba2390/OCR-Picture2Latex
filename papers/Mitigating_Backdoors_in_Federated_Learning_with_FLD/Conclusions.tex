\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we show that the existing defense methods can not effectively defend against SOTA backdoor attacks in federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative robust federated learning backdoor defense algorithm, Federated Layer Detection (FLD). FLD is the first algorithm that assesses model outliers based on the granularity of layer. We theoretically prove the convergence guarantee of FLD on both i.i.d and non-i.i.d data distributions. Extensive experimental results prove the superiority of FLD over SOTA defense methods against various attacks in different scenarios, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of FLD.
