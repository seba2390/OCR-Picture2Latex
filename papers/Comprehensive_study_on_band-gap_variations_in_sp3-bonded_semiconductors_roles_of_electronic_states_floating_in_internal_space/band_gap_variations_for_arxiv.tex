\begin{abstract}
We have performed electronic structure calculations to explore the band-gap dependence on polytypes for $sp^3$-bonded semiconducting materials, i.e., SiC, AlN, BN, GaN, Si, and diamond. In this comprehensive study, we have found that band-gap variation depending on polytypes is common in $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors; SiC, AlN, and BN exhibit smallest band gaps in $3C$ structure, whereas diamond does in $2H$ structure. We have also clarified that the microscopic mechanism of the band-gap variations is attributed to peculiar electron states $floating$ in internal channel space at the conduction-band minimum (CBM), and that internal channel length and the electro-static potential in channel affect the energy level of CBM.

\section{Introduction}

The development of the modern society has been mostly attributed to semiconductor technology. In most semiconductors from elemental to compound, each atom forms $sp^3$ bonds and take four-fold coordinated tetrahedral structure. It is well known that the crystal structure consisting of $sp^3$ bonds exhibit hundreds of polytypes \cite{Dissertation10}. Their structural difference is in the stacking of the tetrahedral units along the $\left<111\right>$ direction in cubic structure, and $\left<0001\right>$ direction in hexagonal structure. Zincblende and wurtzite structures are the most famous examples of them. The Zincblende structure is represented by the stacking sequence of ABC and the wurtzite by AB. Nomenclature adopted vastly is introduced here: each polytype is labeled by the periodicity of the stacking sequence $n$ and the symmetry (cubic or hexagonal) such as $2H$ (wurtzite), $3C$ (zinblende), $4H$, $6H$, etc.

These structural differences have been assumed to be minor in the electronic properties. It is because there are no differences in local atomic structure up to the 2nd nearest neighbor. Valence bands consist of $sp^3$-bonding orbitals and conduction bands $sp^3$-antibonding. However, it is reported that the stacking sequence affects electronic properties considerably in silicon carbide (SiC) \cite{Harris,kimoto}. SiC is indeed a manifestation of the polytypes: Dozens of polytypes of SiC are observed.  Yet, surprisingly, the band gaps vary by 40 \%, from 2.3 eV in 3C to 3.3 eV in 2H despite that the structures are locally identical to each other in all the polytypes \cite{Harris}. This phenomenon was difficult to be understood in conventional chemical pictures.

The energy of the valence-band top is set to be 0. The residual norm which is a measure of the floating nature is calculated in the following procedure: From the pseudo-atomic orbitals $\{\phi_i^{\rm isolated}\}$ of isolated silicon and carbon atoms, we have composed orthonormal basis set $\{\phi_i^{\rm atom}\}$ with the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization. Then we have calculated the squared residual norm, which is defines as $\left| \left|\phi_{n{\bf k}}\right> -\sum_i \left|\phi_i^{\rm atom}\right>\left<\phi_i^{\rm atom}|\phi_{n{\bf k}}\right> \right|^2$ for each band n at ${\bf k}$ point.}

We have recently reported \cite{matsushita1, matsushita2, matsushita3} the microscopic mechanism of band-gap variations in SiC polytypes based on the density functional theory (DFT) \cite{K-S, H-K}. It is found that continuum states exist in conduction bands of $sp^3$-bonded materials, and furthermore, such peculiar electron state appears at the conduction-band minima (CBM) in SiC polytypes. The wavefunction at the CBM is not distributed near atomic sites, but extends (or $floats$) in interstitial channels without atomic orbital character. This fact is clearly shown in Fig.~\ref{seibun}. The figure shows the calculated residual norms of the wavefunction of 3$C$-SiC after projecting it to the $s$- and $p$-atomic orbitals. While the wavefunction in valence bands is well described by $s-$ and $p-$atomic orbitals, conduction electrons cannot. This $floating$ character at the CBM is an important key to reveal the microscopic mechanism of the band-gap variations. %The wave-functions at the CBM of SiC are distributed not near atomic sites but $float$ in the interstitial channel cavity \cite{Matsushita_floating}. 
%Besides, we have found that in SiC channel structure, nano cavity in SiC crystal, is important in band gap variations. the sequence determines the lengths and the directions of the interstitial channels, hereby affecting the shapes of the wave-functions of CBMs. The internal space overlooked in the past may be closely related to the electronic properties of the semiconductors. 
%Hereby the lengths and the directions of the interstitial channels affect the shapes and energy level of the wave-functions of CBMs.
%The extent of the internal space, i.e., the length of the interstitial channel, is decisive in the nano-scale shapes and the energy level of the wave-functions of the CBM and hereby explains the mysterious variation of the band gap in SiC polytypes. 
Channel length changes depending on polytypes: $3C$ structure has infinite channel length along the $\left<110\right>$ direction, while similar channel structure is seen also in $6H$ structure with the length of about $7 a_0 / 2 \sqrt{2}$ along $\langle \bar{2}201 \rangle$ which is slanted relative to $\langle 0001\rangle$ direction with $a_0$ a lattice constant. $Floating$ states at the CBM extends in the internal space. Therefore, channel length and channel shapes are decisive in the positions of the CBM in energy space. In fact, we have found that the energy level of the floating state strongly depends on channel length via quantum confinement effect (see Fig.~\ref{bandgap_HSE}) \cite{matsushita2}. 
%We also find that the observed anisotropy of the effective masses in SiC, and the pressure dependence of the band gaps generally observed in most semiconductors, are naturally explained in terms of the channel length. Further, we find that the stacking control dramatically modifies the electronic properties, leading to generation of low-dimensional electron and hole systems in three-dimensional SiC.

We have already clarified the microscopic mechanism of band-gap variations in SiC cases as shown in Fig.~\ref{seibun} and Fig.~\ref{bandgap_HSE}. From the similarity of the crystal structures, however, it is expected that the similar phenomena can be seen also in other $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of band-gap variations in wide range of $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors, the effects of each atomic character on the electronic properties, and the differences between elemental and compounds semiconductors for Si, diamond, AlN, BN, and GaN. 

\section{ Calculation conditions}
Total-energy band-structure calculations were performed based on the DFT \cite{K-S, H-K} in this study using the plane-wave-basis-set $ab$ $initio$ program package, TAPP \cite{sugino,yamauchi,kageshima}. Our calculations have been performed in the generalized gradient approximations (GGA) \cite{PBE, perdew96}.  Nuclei and core electrons are simulated by either norm-conserving \cite{troullier} pseudo-potentials in the TAPP code. We generate norm-conserving pseudo-potential to simulate nuclei and core electrons, following a recipe by Troullier and Matins \cite{troullier}. The core radius $r_c$ is an essential parameter to determine transferability of the generated pseudo-potential. We have examined $r_c$ dependence of the calculated structural properties of benchmark materials and adopted the pseudo-potentials generated with the following core radii in this paper: 0.85 {\AA} for Si 3$s$, and 1.16 {\AA} for Si 3$p$, 1.06 {\AA} for Ga 4$s$ and 4$p$, and  1.48 {\AA} for Ga 4$d$,  0.64 {\AA} for N 2$s$ and 2$p$, 0.85 {\AA} for C 2$s$ and 2$p$, 1.06 {\AA} for Al 3$s$, 3$p$, and 3$d$,  0.847 {\AA} for B 2$s$ and 2$p$. %, respectively.  


\section{Results and discussion}
We first present our calculated band gaps for structurally optimized polytypes in the next subsection. In the following subsections, we describe the floating states in each polytype and the roles of floating states on band gap variations.

%% TABLE I%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

First, we have theoretically determined lattice constants in the hexagonal plane and along the stacking direction, $a$ and $c$ in the GGA. The obtained $a$ and the ratio $c/na$ of each polytype are listed in Table~\ref{structural parameter}, where $n$ represents the periodicity of stacking bilayers. The differences of $c/na$ among the polytypes are found to be extremely small. This fact means that the distortion along the c-axis is quite small. Our calculated lattice constants agree with available experimental data with an error of at most 2 \%. Table~\ref{structural parameter} also shows the calculated total energy differences ($\Delta E$) among the geometry-optimized polytypes. The table includes some polytypes not observed yet, .e.g, 6$H$-AlN. %The total energy difference is in the range of 50 meV or less per molecular unit, indicating that the polymorphs in $sp^3$-bonded materials offer a good stage to examine characters of the floating states we have found. 
Yet, it is likely that these polytypes are synthesizable since the total energy difference is small, being in the range of 50 meV or less per molecular unit. 

The most energetically favorable polytype in SiC is the $6H$ followed by the $3C$ with the energy increase of 1.2~meV per SiC molecular unit. %Then $2H$ polytype has the total energy higher than $6H$-SiC by 7~meV per SiC unit. 
It is said that $4H$ is also one of the most energetically favorable polytypes \cite{Kobayashi}. Yet, the $6H$ structure is an often observed polytype in experiments, and our calculations show quite small difference in total energy than that of $4H$ polytype by 0.1 meV. Therefore, we discuss the $6H$ polytype in this study. 
% is $4H$ polytype followed by $6H$ polytype with the energy increase of 0.08 meV per SiC molecular unit. Then 3C polytype has the total energy higher than 4H-SiC by 2 meV per SiC unit. The obtained total energies are consistent with the experimental fact that HCSs consisting of 3C polytype and either 4H or 6H polytype are only synthesized by MBE.
The least energetically favorable polytype is $2H$ whose total energy is higher than $6H$ by 7.1~meV per SiC. 
%matsu
%The obtained total energies are consistent with the experimental facts that $3C$-SiC and $6H$-SiC polytypes are only synthesized by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). 
%matsu
We have found that, compared with other materials, SiC exhibits smaller energy difference among polytypes. This is derived from the balance of ionicity and covalency. The materials with dominantly ionicity prefer hexagonal structure. SiC is a exquisite material possessing a delicate balance of ionicity and covalency to exhibit hundreds of polytypes \cite{Kobayashi2}. 
As for the other materials, most stable structure of each material is $2H$-AlN, $2H$-BN, $2H$-GaN, $3C$-Si, and $3C$-C, respectively. 
%These results are consistent with the experimental facts. 
%$2H$ is most stable and the $(3C)_4(6H)_2$ has comparable total energy. $(3C)_4(2H)_6$ has higher energy of 3.8~meV compared with $(3C)_4(4H)_3$. 
The most stable structures in other materials are commonly observed in experiments. %The calculated total energies of HCSs in Table \ref{tab:3-1} are close to the arithmetic mean of the constituting polytypes. This is a peculiar nature in HCSs where the atomic relaxation near the interfaces is tiny. Previous calculations, which show lower total energy for $(3C)_l(2H)_m$ compared with bulk $3C$ polytype,\cite{bechstedt} may be questionable.

Next we have calculated electronic band structure for each material. The calculated results are shown in Fig.~\ref{bands}. Remark that we have adopted a unit cell of the $6H$ structure even for $2H$ and $3C$ structures to facilitate the comparison among the polytypes. %supercell calculations so that the number of electrons in the unit cell may be equal to each other for easy comparison. 
From the figures, the valence bands of the three polytypes resemble each other in each material. The tiny differences are attributed to the difference of the symmetries by which degenerate states in the high-symmetry structure split. The valence-band top is located at $\Gamma$ point in all the polytypes in all the materials. In contrast, the conduction bands are qualitatively different among polytypes in spite of their structural similarity in the local atomic arrangement. In the SiC polytypes, the CBM is located at $K$ point in the $2H$-structure, whereas it is at $M$ point in the $3C$-, and $6H$-structure. The $X$ point in the cubic Brillouin zone (BZ) is folded on the $M$ point in the hexagonal BZ. Furthermore, the lowest conduction band in the $3C$ structure is isolated and shifts downwards substantially, making the band gap narrower by 0.7 - 0.9 eV than those in the $6H$ and $2H$ polytypes. The calculated energy bands for other compounds clearly show the same feature as in SiC, i.e., the CBM in the $3C$-AlN, $3C$-BN is located at $M$ point, whereas that in the $2H$-BN, and $2H$-diamond is located at the $K$ point.

%the lowest conduction band at $M$ point in $3C$-structure is isolated and shifts downwards, while in $2H$ structure at $K$ point. In addition, even in the elementary semiconductors, peculiar lowest conduction band at $M$ point doesn't appear in the $3C$-Si, and $3C$-diamond. Yet, the lowest conduction band at $K$ point in $2H$ structure behaves in the same way. 

The calculated and experimental band gaps for the polytypes are given in Table~\ref{bandgap}. Overall features of the calculated band-gap variation are in accord with the experimental values. It is clearly seen that the GGA underestimates energy gaps by about 50\% because of the shortcoming inherent in the GGA. If necessary, the quantitative description of the energy gaps is possible using more sophisticated schemes of the GW \cite{GW1, GW2, GWissue} for quasiparticle-self energy or HSE functional \cite{HSE, HSE04, HSE05, HSE06, matsushita4} for the exchange-correlation energy. Yet, the relative difference in the energy gap calculated by the GGA among the polytypes is well reproduced, i.e., calculated results show the band gap of the $3C$-SiC is smaller than that of the $2H$-SiC by 0.936 eV, which corresponds to the experimental one, 0.93 eV.

%% TABLE I%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

From the Table~\ref{bandgap}, it has been found that the large band-gap variation is not limited to the SiC polytypes. For AlN and BN, the energy gap decreases substantially in the $3C$ structures by 0.9 eV and 0.8 eV, respectively. In the case of AlN, the CBM at $M$ point shifts downwards substantially, so that the transition between the direct gap in the most stable $2H$-structure and the indirect gap in the metastable $3C$-structure takes place. This result gives good agreement with the observed experimental facts. %In contrast, the CBMs at the $K$ point are isolated and shift downwards. The CBM in $2H$-BN is located at the $K$ point. 
In contrast, for the diamond polytypes, the band-gap decrease can be seen not at the $3C$-structure, but at the $2H$-structure: the energy gap varies from 4.521 eV in the $6H$-structure to 3.406 eV in the $2H$-structure.

%\subsection{Floating states in SiC}
%First we show the floating states in conduction bands in SiC polytypes. 
%As we have clarified in the previous papers, continuum-state like character in the conduction bands of SiC polytypes play important roles in the band-gap variation. 

%As shown in Fig.~\ref{seibun}, 
%The CBM of SiC is distributed in internal channel cavity without atomic orbital character, e.g., $\langle 110 \rangle$ channels in 3$C$-SiC, and finite-length $\langle 2\bar{2}01 \rangle$ channels in 6$H$-SiC. We have reported that the energy level of the peculiar electron states floating in interstitial channels is influenced by channel length and the symmetry of the channel structure, causing band-gap variation. In this subsection, we discuss the character of the CBM in other semiconductors of 3$C$ structure. The band character of 2$H$ will be described in subsection~\ref{result_2H}.


%In order to identify the floating electron bands, it is useful to calculate the residual norm of the wave function after projecting it to the $s$- and $p$-atomic orbitals. 
%The quantity is calculated in the following procedure. Remark that atomic orbitals centered on different lattice sites are not orthogonal. Therefore, from the pseudo-atomic orbitals $\phi_s^{\rm isolated}$ and $\phi_p^{\rm isolated}$ of isolated silicon and carbon atoms, we have composed orthonormal basis set $\{\phi_i^{\rm atom}\}$ with the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization. Then we have calculated the squared residual norm, which is defined as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{definition_residual}
%\left| \left|\phi_{n{\bf k}}\right> -\sum_i \left|\phi_i^{\rm atom}\right>\left<\phi_i^{\rm atom}|\phi_{n{\bf k}}\right> \right|^2
%\end{equation}
%for each $k$ point, and each band $n$. Figure~\ref{seibun} shows the calculated squared norm of the residual components for the $3C$-SiC. It is clearly shown that the valence bands are well described in the linear combination of the atomic $s$- and $p$-orbitals. The squared norm of the residual wave function at the valence-band top is only 0.09. On the other hand, as for the electron state at the CBM, the residual norm is as much as 0.33. It is clear that the floating state is difficult to be described by the $s$-, and $p$-atomic orbitals only. More detailed discussions are in Sec.~\ref{LCAO_3C}.
%Furthermore, it is also clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{seibun} that the wave function of the CBM at $K$ point has also floating nature; i.e., 0.37. %The CBM at $K$ point is also of floating-state character. 
%It extends along the $[1\bar{1}0]$, $[10\bar{1}]$, and $[01\bar{1}]$ channels on (111) plane and mixes with C atomic orbitals (See Figure~\ref{3C-SiC-K}). Fig.~\ref{3C-SiC-K}(d) shows that the kinetic-energy and the Hartree-energy gains for the floating states at $K$ point are 6.8 eV and 9.1 eV, respectively, compared with the valence-band top state, which is of usual atomic-orbital character. This fact is corresponding with a well-known fact that conduction bands are difficult to be reproduced by the tight-binding method.

We discuss the microscopic mechanism of the band-gap variation in this subsection. As we have clarified in the previous papers \cite{matsushita1,matsushita2,matsushita3}, continuum-state like character at CBM in SiC polytypes plays important roles in the band-gap variation. As shown in Fig.~\ref{3C-floating} (a), 
%the floating nature at the conduction-band minimum (CBM) plays important roles in band-gap variations in SiC polytypes.

%, and finite-length $\langle 2\bar{2}01 \rangle$ channels in 6$H$-SiC. 
%We have reported that the energy level of the floating state is influenced by channel length and the symmetry of the channel structure, causing band-gap variation. 
Si atoms are positively charged because of the differences in electronegativity between Si and C atom in SiC crystals (see Fig.~\ref{SiC-interstitial}(a)). Thus, this charge transfer causes the electro-static potential at the tetrahedral ($T_{d}$) interstitial sites surrounded by 4 Si atoms lower. These $T_d$ interstitial sites construct the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channels where the floating state extends having the maximum amplitude at $T_d$ sites. This lowering of electro-static potential at $T_{d}$ interstitial sites shifts the energy level of the floating state downwards.

First we discuss the character of the CBM in other $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors in 3$C$ structure in Fig.~\ref{3C-floating}. 
%can be seen in most semiconductors. Surprisingly, some of them are located CBM. We show the floating states in the $3C$ structures in Sec.~\ref{result_3C}, and in the $2H$ structures in Sec.~\ref{result_2H}.
%The sequence of the atomic bilayers determines the length and direction of the interstitial channels: e.g., in the 3$C$ polytype the channel along $\langle 110 \rangle$ extends infinitely, whereas in the 6$H$ polytype the cannel along $\langle 2\bar{2}01 \rangle$ has a finite length of 7$a_0$ / 2 $\sqrt{2}$ ($a_0$: lattice constant). To examine the relation between the extent of the internal space and the band gap, we consider 24 representative stacking sequences in 3$C$ and $nH$ (2 $\le n \le$ 12) polytypes. Details of the 24 polytypes are listed in Supplement Material \cite{SM}. In the 2$H$, 3$C$, 4$H$ and 5$H$ polytypes, the sequence of the bilayer stacking is unique. In the $6H$, $8H$, $10H$, and $12H$ polytypes, there are 2, 6, 18, and 58 possibilities in the stacking sequence, respectively \cite{Iglesias}. The possible values of the hexagonality in the $10H$ polytype are 20, 40, 60, and 80\%, whereas those in the $12H$ polytype are 16.7, 33.3, 50, 66.7, and 83.3\%. Our 24 representatives include all the possible hexagonality in the the $6H$, $8H$, $10H$, and $12H$ polytypes \cite{Kobayashi}. 
As clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{3C-floating}, the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals at the CBM at $M$ point in $3C$ structure on $\left(0\bar{1}1\right)$ %, and $\left(110\right)$ 
plane obtained in the GGA calculations are similar to that of SiC, indicating that the CBMs at $M$ point in other $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors are also floating states extending in $\langle 110 \rangle$ channels. These structures have similar channel features as SiC: $T_d$ interstitial sites surrounded by cations form $\langle 110 \rangle$ channels, rendering the energy level of floating states lower. 
%Most striking material is AlN. Yet due to the stronger ionicity in III-V compound semiconductors, the extension of the KS orbital to the cation sites makes the energy of the CBM at $\Gamma$ point lower in AlN and GaN. Owing to the competition with the electro-static energy gain from the cation tetrahedron which makes the energy of the floating state at $M$-point low, the transition between the direct gap in $2H$ structure and the indirect gap in $3C$ structure takes place for AlN.

In contrast, elemental semiconductors, such as Si and diamond, exhibit no such band-gap variation in $3C$ structure. It is because there is no charge transfer unlike the compound ones. This fact makes no potential lowering at $T_d$ interstitial sites, causing no band-gap narrowing in elemental semiconductors. 
%Yet, even in elemental semiconductors, the floating states exist although they are not necessarily at the CBM. We have examined cubic Si and C and indeed found the floating states. For $3C$-Si, Fig.~\ref{Si-floating}(a) shows the KS orbital of the CBM at $M$ point ($X$ point in cubic BZ). We have found this state has the bonding character of the floating and the atomic-orbital states. From the tight-binding picture, the CBM at $M$ point is the anti-bonding state of the $s$ orbital and the neighboring $p$ orbital extending along $\langle 001 \rangle$ direction. This state is mixed with the floating state and thus the KS orbital distributes in the $\langle 110 \rangle$  channel. The KS orbital of the valence-band-bottom state at $\Gamma$ is shown in Fig. \ref{Si-floating}(b). Basically it is the bonding state of $s$ orbitals, but extends in the interstitial region substantially: The calculated amplitude at the interstitial $T_d$ site is 23 \% of the maximum amplitude in sharp contrast with the valence-band-top state which is the bonding state of $p$ orbitals with the amplitude at $T_d$ site being about 1 \% of the maximum value. Hence the valence-band-bottom state is obviously the bonding state between $s$ orbitals and the floating state. The KS orbital of the anti-bonding counterpart which is located at 7.81 eV above the valence-band top, i.e., above the vacuum level, is shown in Fig.~\ref{Si-floating}(c), clearly exhibiting the floating character. 

Next we discuss why band-gap variations are not seen in $2H$ structure. As mentioned above, charge transfer plays important roles in the substantial band-gap decrease in the $3C$ structures. On the other hand, in the $2H$-structure such a cation-surrounded channel is absent. The internal space surrounded by cations overlaps considerably with that by anions in the $2H$ structure [See Fig.~\ref{SiC-interstitial}]. The cation-surrounded interstitial site is very close to the anion-surrounded one with the separation of $d/3$, where $d$ is the bond length between silicon and carbon atoms. In fact, the electro-static potential at the cation-surrounded interstitial sites is almost the same as that at anion-surrounded ones within 0.1 eV in the case of SiC. Therefore, in the $2H$ structures, charge transfer doesn't cause the static potential lowering, leading to no band-gap variation. 
%The floating states in $2H$ structure is discussed in next section.

%Surprisingly, the orbital is distributed not near atomic sites but extends, or $floats$, in channels along $\langle 110 \rangle$  direction. The orbital changes its sign along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channel with the periodicity of $\sqrt{2} a_0$ ( $a_0$: lattice constant) and has nodes on the atomic plane containing Si atoms, thus avoiding atomic sites and distributing solely in the internal space. By examining the irreducible representation at $M$ point, it is found that this phase variation of the KS orbital is allowed only at $M$ point in the hexagonal BZ. 

%As we have clarified in the Ref.~{}, the substantial energy-gap variations are caused by the presence of {\it floating states}. 
%As we have clarified in the Ref.~\cite{Matsushita}, the key of the substantial energy-gap variations is the presence of peculiar electron states $floating$ in internal space of $sp^3$-bonded materials.

%Figure~\ref{3C-SiC-CBM}(c) shows the contribution from the kinetic-energy, 
%\begin{equation}
%\varepsilon_{\rm kin} = \langle \varphi_i | - \nabla^2 / 2 | \varphi_i \rangle,

%\label{Hartree_energy}
% \end{equation}
%  to the orbital energy of each KS state at $M$ point in the $3C$-SiC. It is clear that the floating state gains the kinetic energy and the Hartree energy, compared with other states. The kinetic-energy gain obviously comes from the extended orbital distribution in the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channel. The Hartree-energy gain, on the other hand, comes from ionic character of SiC. The electronegativity of C, 2.55, is larger than that of Si, 1.90, causing the electron transfer from Si to C in SiC. Our calculations indeed show that the electrostatic potential at the tetrahedral ($T_d$) interstitial site surrounded by 4 Si atoms is lower than that at another $T_d$ site surrounded by 4 C atoms by 2.56 eV (See Fig. \ref{3C-SiC-CBM}(d)). The floating state has the maximum amplitude at the Si-surrounded $T_d$ sites, thus floating in the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channel. These energy gains cause the band-gap narrowing at $M$ point.

%The floating-state orbital with its sign unchanged along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channel is also possible. Such in-phase state is allowed, however, not at $M$ point but at $\Gamma$ point. Furthermore, the in-phase orbital has amplitudes inevitably at atomic sites, thus mixing with mainly $s$-character orbitals. We have indeed found such hybridized states at $\Gamma$ point as shown in Fig. \ref{3C-SiC-KM}(a) and (b): The fourth lowest conduction-band at $\Gamma$ which is the lowest conduction-band state at L point in the original cubic BZ is the anti-bonding state of the in-phase floating state and $s$ orbitals of C. This mixing with atomic orbitals makes the resultant hybridized state shift upwards due to the kinetic- and Hartree-energy increase.

\end{figure}
%\end{figure*}

In this subsection we discuss the electronic structure at CBM in $6H$ structure. As mentioned above, in the $3C$ structures, the $\left<110\right>$ channels with infinite length play important roles in the variations in energy gaps. Similar channel structure is seen also in $6H$ structure. There is channels with the length of about $7 a_0 / 2 \sqrt{2}$ along $\langle \bar{2}201 \rangle$ which is slanted relative to $\langle 0001\rangle$ direction with $a_0$ a lattice constant. %At the hexagonal-stacking layer, the slanted channels are closed. Hexagonal-stacking layers play as a wall of the channels, thus interrupting the floating character of electrons in the slated channels. 
%In $6H$ structure, the channel length is $7a_0/2\sqrt{2}$, with the $a_0$ being a Bohr radius. 
The calculated KS orbital at the CBM of SiC is shown in Fig.~\ref{6H-SiC}, where the wavefunction has the maximum amplitude at the tetrahedral $T_d$ interstitial sites, and $floats$ in the finite-length channels. Due to quantum confinement of the wavefunction, however, the kinetic energy at the CBM is greater than that in $3C$ structure and the band gap of $6H$ structure becomes wider [See Fig.~\ref{bands} and Table.~II] by 0.66 eV. The relations between the channel length and band gap is clearly shown in Fig.~\ref{seibun}. 
%Therefore, the floating states extending in the $\left<2\bar{2}01\right>$ channels are confined in the small internal space, and the energy level of the floating state is higher than that in $3C$. 
%Fig.~\ref{6H-SiC} shows the KS orbital of the CBM at $M$ and $K$ point in $6H$ structure. 
%The contour plots (a) and (b) show that the floating state at $M$ point is distributed in the finite-length slanted $\left<2\bar{2}01\right>$ channels broadly. %, and horizontal $\left<\bar{2}201\right>$ channels dimly. 
%The contour plots (c) and (d) show the floating state at $K$ point. The floating state clearly extends the horizontal channels broadly. They resemble the corresponding KS orbitals in $3C$-SiC. 
Similar tendency is observed also in other $sp^3$ compound semiconductors. AlN, and BN in $6H$ structure exhibit 0.49 eV, and 0.7 eV wider band gap than that in $3C$, respectively.

% other structures & hexagonality
In this subsection we discuss the electronic structure at CBM in $2H$ structure, and give an explanation why diamond exhibits smallest band gap at $2H$ structure. 
The floating state at $M$ point in the $3C$-polytypes is distributed along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ channel which is slanted relative to $\langle 111\rangle$ direction. In the $2H$ structure, such a slanted channel is absent. Instead, there are channels along $\langle 11\bar{2}0 \rangle$ and $\langle 0001 \rangle$ directions. We have found that the CBM at $K$ point in the $2H$ structure floats in the $\langle 11\bar{2}0 \rangle$  channel  in SiC case (Fig.~\ref{2H-K}(a)). This floating state is distributed solely in the $\langle 11\bar{2}0 \rangle$ channel with its phase changing consecutively by $\exp (i 2 \pi / 3)$, thus avoiding the atomic sites on (0001) planes. It is also found that the floating state is distributed closer to the planes of positively-charged Si atoms to gain the electro-static energy. The phase change of the floating orbital along this channel is compatible with the symmetry of the Bloch state at $K$ point. %Analyses of the KS orbital energies shown in Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC}(b) clearly show that the energy gain comes from the kinetic- and the Hartree-energy parts. %The reason for the kinetic energy gain is the same as that in the $3C$-SiC. 
%Though the $2H$ structure does not have cation-surrounded channels, there are channels along $\langle 11\bar{2}0 \rangle$ and $\langle 0001 \rangle$ directions instead. To understand the band structures of the $2H$ structure, it is needed to consider the channels. Yet, the details of the channels in the $2H$-structure are described in the next section.

%\subsubsection{Floating states at the CBM} 

%other compound semiconductors
We then expect that the existence of the floating states is common to $2H$ structure in most $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors. We have therefore examined $2H$-AlN, $2H$-BN, $2H$-GaN, $2H$-Si, and $2H$-diamond. Fig.~\ref{2H-K} shows the CBM at $K$ point of them. We clearly see the floating states in all materials. %In-phase floating state also exists at the CBM of $\Gamma$ point in $2H$-AlN, and $2H$-GaN [Fig.~\ref{2H-AlN}]. 
%Due to the stronger ionicity in III-V compound semiconductors, the extension of the KS orbital to the cation sites makes the energy of the CBM at $\Gamma$ point lower in AlN and GaN. %Owing to the competition with the electrostatic energy gain from the cation tetrahedron which makes the energy of the floating state at $M$-point low, the transition between the direct gap in $2H$ structure and the indirect gap in $3C$ structure takes place for AlN. 
Most remarkable case is diamond. Diamond polytypes show substantial band-gap decrease in the $2H$ structure. Fig.~\ref{2H-K}(e) shows the KS orbital at the CBM of the $2H$-diamond. The KS orbital is also distributed not near atomic sites, but $floats$ in internal space. 
Fig.~\ref{2H-diamond-CBM}(a) shows the residual norm of wavefunction after the projection to the $s$-, and $p$-atomic orbitals. As much as 0.47 are floating character at the CBM in the $2H$-diamond, while it is only 0.04 at the valence-band top. This fact shows that this KS orbital at the CBM does not consist of atomic orbitals neither. The maximum amplitude is on the axis of the $\left<0001\right>$ channels, and the floating state is distributed in the horizontal channels. We have found that the floating state induces band-gap variations also in this system. 

In order to clarify the reason for the energy gain of the floating state, we show the energy analyses of KS orbitals at $K$ point in Fig.~\ref{2H-diamond-CBM}(b). According to the figure, floating state reveals the kinetic energy gain by extending in the channels broadly. Another energy gain is Coulomb energy gain, because the floating state is distributed far from atomic nuclei, which core electrons are distributed near around. In addition, we have found that the electro-static potential from the ions energy gain plays important roles in the decrease of the energy gap in the $2H$-diamond. 
%Analyses of the KS orbital energies shown in Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC}(b) clearly show that the energy gain comes from the kinetic- and the Hartree-energy parts. Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC}(c) shows that the residual norm of the wave function without $s$- and $p$-atomic orbitals [Eq.~\ref{definition_residual}]. A similar tendency is seen in the figure as that in the $3C$-SiC. It is clearly shown that the valence bands are well described in the linear combination of the atomic $s$- and $p$- orbitals. The residual norm of the wave function at the valence-band top is only 0.08. On the other hand, as for the CBM, the residual norm is as much as 0.40. 
%Yet, it is found that the 60\% component of the CBM is explained by the atomic orbitals. More detailed discussions are in Sec.~\ref{LCAO_2H}.
%According to the result, the wave function of the CBM at $M$ point has also floating nature; i.e., 0.35. %It extends along the $[xxx]$ channels on (xxx) plane and mixes with C atomic orbitals (See Figure~\ref{2C-SiC-M}).
%In the $2H$ polytypes, the number of neighbor atoms around the interstitial sites is large compared with other polytypes. This causes the band-gap decrease in the $2H$ polytype. The details are discussed in Sec.~\ref{multimoment}.
%By examining the component of the carbon-$2s$ and -$2p$ orbitals for each KS orbital, the CBM at $K$ point includes other components as much as xx \%: Fig.~\ref{2H-diamond-CBM} (e). In contrast, valence bands are 
In fact, the local atomic structure around the interstitial sites is different between the $3C$ and $2H$ structure. The interstitial site in $2H$ structure is surrounded by six nearest neighbor atoms, and six next nearest neighbor atoms. In contrast, the interstitial site in the $3C$ polytype is surrounded by four nearest neighbor, and three next neighbor atoms. That is, in the $2H$ polytypes, the number of neighbor atoms around the interstitial sites is larger compared with other polytypes. %This causes the band-gap decrease in the $2H$ polytype. The details are discussed in Sec.~\ref{multimoment}.
This structural difference makes the electro-static potential at the interstitial sites in the $2H$-diamond lower than that in the $3C$-diamond by 0.589 eV from the DFT calculation. That value corresponds to the band-gap variation in the $2H$ structure, 0.8 eV smaller than $3C$. %The relation between the number of neighbor atoms and the electro-static potential is discussed in detail in Sec.~\ref{multimoment}.

%\section{Packing efficiency and floating state}\label{result_packing}
%It is thought that there is no space to allow "floating" states in condensed matter. Yet, the appearance of the conduction-band states which float in particular channels in $sp^3$-bonded materials is a consequence of the existence of the internal space. It is noteworthy that the packing efficiency, $p$, of the $sp^3$-bonded structure is 0.34, being extremely small compared with other crystal structures: $p$ = 0.52 for simple cubic, $p$ = 0.68 for body-centered cubic, $p$ = 0.74 for face-centered cubic and $p$ =0.74 for hexagonal close-packed structures, respectively. It has been concluded that the existence of the floating states is common to most $sp^3$-covalent semiconductors. In addition, the difference in the electro-negativity between the constituent atoms causes particular $T_d$ interstitial sites energetically favorable. 

%\section{Comparison with LCAO calculations}\label{result_LCAO}
%The focus of this section is on the capability of describing the floating states by LCAO calculations. LCAO calculation is one of the simplest and most widely used schemes to analyze the electron states. The spirit is based on an idea that electrons generally have their own atomic-orbital characters even in the condensed matter and thus produce various physical and chemical properties. Thus, LCAO calculation uses atomic orbital as a basis function to describe the electron states. Therefore, it is thought that relatively small basis set is enough to provide reasonable results. In $sp^3$-bonded materials, however, floating state is ubiquitous in conduction bands, as described above. It is nontrivial whether the LCAO calculations describe the floating states or not. We have investigated the capability of the LCAO calculations in describing the floating nature in this section.

%\subsection{Floating states in $3C$ polytype calculated by LCAO basis sets} \label{LCAO_3C}
%We have used OpenMX code to perform LCAO calculations. In the OpenMX code \cite{Ozaki1, Ozaki2}, the LCAO basis are generated by introducing a cutoff radius at which the potential well cut the tail of the atomic orbitals. In this scheme, the accuracy of the results is determined by two important parameters: a cutoff radius and the number of basis orbitals. The cutoff radius represents the spread of basis orbitals, which implys a larger cutoff radius and larger number of basis orbitals provide more accurate results. We have performed the LCAO calculations, changing the number of basis orbitals. We have used two kinds of cutoff radii in this work: (i) larger cutoff radii, and (ii) smaller ones.  (i) The larger cutoff radii for Si is 4.76 (\AA), and for C is 5.29 (\AA), (ii) smaller ones for Si is 2.91 (\AA), and for C is 2.65 (\AA). The number of basis orbitals is the following: (a) the minimum basis set: 3$s$, and 3$p$ of Si, and $2s$, and 2$p$ of C, (b) the more accurate basis set: 3$s$, 3$p$, and 3$d$ of Si, and 2$s$, and 2$p$ of C, and (c) the most accurate basis set: 3$s$, 3$p$, 3$d$, 4$s$, 4$p$, 4$d$, and 4$f$, 5$s$, and 5$p$ of Si, and 2$s$, 2$p$, 3$s$, 3$p$, 3$d$, 4$s$, and 4$p$ of C. Other calculation conditions are the same as those in the plane-wave-basis-set calculations.

%Table~\ref{totalenergy-SiC} shows the total energies, $E_{\rm tot}$, calculated by the LCAO basis sets. In the LCAO calculations, KS orbitals are expanded by the atomic orbitals, and the total energy behaves under the variation principle. In fact, the convergence of total energy with respect to the number of basis orbitals gives an indicator, representing the calculation accuracy. From the table, larger-cutoff radii and larger number of basis orbitals give more accurate results as we expect. 

%Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate} shows the calculated band structures and KS orbital of the CBM at $M$ point with the larger cutoff radii.  From the figures, the valence bands resemble each other, regardless of the number of basis orbitals. In contrast, the conduction bands are changed sensitively depending on the number of basis orbitals. 

%From the Figure~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(a), the CBM shifts upward by 2.01 eV compared with Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(0), indicating the incompleteness of the atomic-orbital basis. The KS orbital at the CBM is quite different from the plane-wave-basis one. It is understood clearly that the orbital in Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(a) consists of the anti-bonding orbitals of carbon-$s$ and silicone-$p_z$ orbitals. The result is consistent with a result by tight-binding model, in which the tail of the $p$ orbitals extend to the interstitial region. The maximum amplitude is, however, at the carbon atomic sites in contrast with Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(0) where the maximum amplitude of the state obtained in the plane-wave-basis set is at the tetrahedral, $T_d$, interstitial sites. In the LCAO result, the amplitude at the $T_d$ site is 62.3 \% of the amplitude at the atomic sites. As mentioned in the Sec.\ref{result_3C}, the 66\% of the KS orbital at the CBM is atomic orbital component, and the LCAO results seem to resemble the plane-wave-basis one. 
%If we use more extended atomic orbitals as basis functions, then the floating nature may be reproduced. 

%We also present the LCAO results increasing the number of basis orbitals in Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(b), and (c). The energy gaps in Fig.~\ref{SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(b), (c) are 1.56 eV, and 1.38 eV, respectively. This shows that even the LCAO calculation including Si-$3d$ orbitals as a basis set is still insufficient. The energy level of Si-$3d$ orbital is much higher than that of Si-$3p$ orbital by 8.33eV. 
%The KS orbital at the CBM resembles that by the plane-wave-basis set in (b) and (c). These results reproduce the location of the maximum amplitudes properly. Yet, this shows that we need to use more atomic orbitals as a basis set than our simple expectation, when we perform the LCAO calculations for $sp^3$-bonded materials.

%\subsection{Floating states in $2H$ polytype calculated by LCAO basis sets} \label{LCAO_2H}
%As shown above, floating states exist also in the $2H$ polytypes. %Whether the LCAO calculation describes the floating nature in $2H$ structure or not is a nontrivial problem. 
%Therefore, we have also performed the LCAO calculations for the $2H$-SiC, and the $2H$-diamond with the OpenMX code.

%We have performed the LCAO calculations, changing the cutoff radii, and the number of basis orbitals. The cutoff radii used in this work are followings: For the calculations of $2H$-SiC, the same as those of the $3C$-SiC above. For $2H$-diamond, the larger cutoff radius for C is 5.29 (\AA), and smaller one for C is 2.65 (\AA). The number of basis orbitals is following: (a) the minimum basis set: C-$2s$, and -2$p$, (b) the more accurate basis set: C-2$s$, -2$p$, -3$s$, -3$p$, and -3$d$, and (c) the most accurate basis set: C-2$s$, -2$p$, -3$s$, -3$p$, -3$d$, -4$s$, -4$p$, and -4$d$.

%Table~\ref{totalenergy-2H-SiC} shows the calculated total energy.

For the larger cutoff radii, it is clearly seen that the total energy is improved by using the basis set including more high-energy Si-3$d$ orbitals as a basis set. On the other hand, as for the smaller cutoff basis set, including the Si-$3d$ orbitals as a basis set is still poor to describe the total energy, i.e., 0.938 eV higher than the most accurate basis set.

%Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-LCAO-highaccurate} shows the calculated band structures using the larger cutoff radii, and Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-LCAO-lowaccurate} using the smaller cutoff radii. For the larger cutoff radii, it is found that valence bands resemble each other. On the other hand, as for the minimum basis set (Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(a)), qualitative features of the conduction bands are substantially different from those obtained with the plane-wave basis set as shown in Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(0): The CBM is at some point between $\Gamma$ and $M$ in the LCAO basis, whereas it is at $K$ point in the plane-wave basis. The band gap in the LCAO is 2.207 eV higher than that by the plane-wave-basis set. 
%The Kohn-sham orbital of the conduction-band bottom at $K$ point. In (b), the isovalue surface of the squared KS orbital viewed from [0001] direction at its value of 80\% of the maximum value and in (c), the isovalue surface of the same orbital at its value of 30\% of the maximum value are shown. 
%The floating nature of the state which is clearly shown in the center and right panels of Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-LCAO-highaccurate}(0) obtained in the plane-wave-basis-set calculations are totally lacking in this LCAO-basis-set calculations. In a tight-binding model, the conduction-band bottom at $K$ point is the anti-bonding state of $p$ orbitals extending in the (0001) plane. The squared KS orbitals shown in the center and right panels of (a) are in accord with this picture. %This atomic-orbital nature is clearly seen in (d) where the contour plot of the same orbital on () plane obtained in LCAO calculations is shown.
%The wave function at lowest-conduction band at $K$ point has the maximum amplitude at the carbon sites, showing no floating character. This atomic-orbital nature is clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-CBM_PWvsLCAO} where the contour plots of the same orbital on the $(11{\bar 2}00)$ plane obtained in LCAO calculations are shown. In the LCAO calculations, the CBM consists of 57.4 \% of Si-$3p$, and 42.5 \% of C-$2p$. On the other hand, the floating state distributes closer to the planes of positively-charged Si atoms to gain the electrostatic energy [Fig.~\ref{2H-SiC-CBM_PWvsLCAO}(b)]. 

%Even if we include the Si-$3d$ atomic orbitals as a basis set (b), the band gap is 3.134 eV, much larger by 0.779 eV. %Remark that as to the total energy, this basis set gives a comparably reasonable result, but this does not yield a guarantee of reproduction of the floating nature. 
%The KS orbital at the CBM at $K$ point extends to the interstitial sites to some extent, but still the maximum amplitude is at atomic sites, silicon sites. Using the most accurate basis set (c), it is found that the wave function looks like the plane-wave one. It is found that floating nature is quite difficult to produce by the conventional LCAO calculation. The band gap is 2.34 eV, in good agreement with the value by the plane-wave-basis set, 2.355 eV. In the case of smaller cutoff radii, the minimum basis set is poor to describe the band structure as well. The band gap is 4.923 eV, much larger than that using the plane-wave-basis set, 2.355 eV. For the basis set (b), the KS orbitals seem to have the floating character, but their band gaps are 3.115 eV, still larger than that calculated by plane-wave-basis set, 2.355 eV. The band gap calculated by the LCAO using the most accurate basis set shows 2.26 eV, which accords with that by plane-wave-basis set. 
%We have found that when we use extremely high-energy atomic orbitals as a basis set, the LCAO calculations reproduce the floating nature. This fact clearly shows that we should go beyond the conventional LCAO picture to reproduce the floating nature.

%Furthermore, we have performed LCAO calculations for $2H$-diamond. 
%Table~\ref{totalenergy} shows the total energies, $E_{\rm tot}$, calculated by the LCAO basis sets. From the table, larger-cutoff radii and larger number of basis orbitals give more accurate results. 

%check 
%Fig.~\ref{diamond-LCAO-highaccurate} shows the calculated band structures and KS orbitals of the CBM at $K$ point with the larger cutoff radii.  From the figures, the valence bands resemble each other, regardless of the number of basis orbitals. In contrast, the conduction bands are changed sensitively depending on the number of basis orbitals. 

%From the Figure~\ref{diamond-LCAO-highaccurate}(a), the CBM is at $\Gamma$ point, thus showing a direct-gap semiconductor. This result qualitatively contradicts with that of plane-wave-basis set, where this system is a indirect-gap semiconductor. Its band gap is 6.02 eV, which is higher than that of plane-wave-basis set by 2.61 eV, indicating the incompleteness of the atomic-orbital basis. The KS orbital at the CBM has no floating nature. It is understood clearly that the orbital consists of the anti-bonding orbitals of carbon-$p$ orbitals. Indeed, the maximum amplitude is at the carbon atomic sites in contrast with Fig.~\ref{diamond-LCAO-highaccurate}(0) where the maximum amplitude of the state obtained in the plane-wave-basis set is at the axis of the $\left<0001\right>$ (vertical to the $a,b$-plane) channels. In the LCAO result, the amplitude at the axis of the $\left<0001\right>$ channels is only 7 \% of the amplitude at the atomic sites. In addition, this result is consistent with that of tight-binding model.


%We also present the LCAO results with increasing the number of basis orbitals in Figs.~\ref{diamond-LCAO-highaccurate}(b), and (c). The energy gaps in Fig.~\ref{diamond-LCAO-highaccurate}(b), (c) are 4.01 eV, and 3.49 eV, respectively. In the calculation (b), we use carbon-3$s$, -3$p$, and -3$d$ orbitals as a basis set in addition to basis set(a), which are energetically higher state than carbon-$2p$ orbitals by 8.48 eV, is still inadequate to describe the conduction bands. The maximum amplitude is still at carbon sites, and shows floating nature a little. The amplitude at the axis of the vertical channels is 78 \% of the atomic sites. In the calculation (c), we sum up with atomic orbitals higher 14.16 eV than C-$2p$ orbitals. The results seem to show floating nature of KS orbital. The maximum amplitude is at the axis, thus reproducing the band-gap variations in LCAO calculations. 

%According to the Mariken population analysis, 
%From the analysis of the component of the wave function in the LCAO calculation, 
%the CBM at $K$ point consists 61.4\% of carbon-$3d$, and 12.6 \% of carbon-$4d$ orbitals. It's noteworthy that total percentages of the components of carbon-$3s$, $3p$, $4s$, $4p$ is only 4.6 \%. The unnatural fillings are remarkable. To describe the conduction bands in $sp^3$-bonded materials, we need more basis orbitals than those usually thought to be enough. We have also performed the LCAO calculations with small cutoff radii, in Fig.~\ref{diamond-LCAO-lowaccurate}. The results show little difference from that of the larger cutoff ones. From the results, we have found the LCAO calculations are difficult to reproduce the floating nature, regardless of the spread of the basis orbitals.

%\section{Intercalated systems}
%In most cases, floating sate exists in the conduction electron states. Yet, the DFT is not verified in application to the unoccupied electron states. We then have performed electronic-structure calculations for electron-doped SiC polytypes. The doped electrons are thought to occupy the floating sate at the CBM. We have doped $1.59\times 10^{21}\ [{\rm cm}^{-3}]$ per the 6 pairs of SiC molecule units. First, we have optimized the lattice constants in the hexagonal plane and along the stacking direction, $a$ and $c$. For the doped $3C$-SiC, the lattice constant $a$ indicates only 0.38 \% increase over that of the intrinsic $3C$-SiC. Moreover, the lattice constant $a$ ($c$) of the doped $2H$-SiC is increased only 0.49 \% (0.354\%). From these results, the lattice constants are almost unchanged in electron doping.

%\label{Intercalated-wfn}
%\end{figure*}

%Fig.~\ref{Intercalated-band} shows the calculated band structures. We have found that the band structures are understood completely by the rigid band model. %The valence band width of the $2H$- ($3C$-)SiC is xx eV (xx eV), which is consistent with that in corresponding intrinsic system. 
%The KS orbital at the occupied CBM is shown in the Fig.~\ref{Intercalated-wfn}. The orbitals clearly manifest the floating character. We have found the electron carriers have floating nature in n-doped SiC semiconductors.  

%\section{Multipole decomposition of electrostatic potential}\label{multimoment}
%From the chapter.~\ref{results}, we have found that floating states are ubiquitous in $sp^3$-bonded materials. The floating nature is a consequence of the existence of the internal channel space in the materials. In most covalent semiconductors, the floating states appear at the conduction-band minima whose energy level is lower than the vacuum level: e.g., the vacuum level is higher than the conduction-band minimum (CBM) in the $6H$-SiC by 3.0 eV in the experiment \cite{Pelletier}. Here one question arises: why the energy level of floating state is lower than the vacuum level? 
%work function in the $2H$-SiC is 4.6-4.8 eV. 
%Even if how the kinetic energy gain of the floating state is large, the kinetic energy is positive, and 
%It means that the electrostatic potential in the internal space should be lower than vacuum level substantially. 
%The electrostatic potential in the internal space, i.e., in interstitial sites, is expected to be much lower than the vacuum, however. This is because 
%However, the core- and valence-electron cloud is distributed near the nucleus, and screens the attractive potential from the nucleus. Due to the Gauss's theorem, the electro-static potential far from the nucleus seems to decay exponentially. 
%Therefore, the electrostatic potential at interstitial sites is thought not to be so lower than the vacuum level. 
%This expectation looks conflicted with the existence of the floating state at the CBM. 

%In order to clarify this apparent contradiction, we have first plotted the electro-static potential of an isolated Si atom (Fig.~\ref{modelpot} (a)). First, it is clearly seen that the electro-static potential from the nucleus and occupied electrons has a spherical symmetry, because the electron distribution has also spherical symmetry in the case of an isolated atom. The electro-static potential at the distance of $1.9$ \AA\  from the nucleus is only $-$0.6 eV, where the distance of $1.9$ \AA\  is the distance between the Si atom and the interstitial site in the $3C$-SiC. In the $3C$-SiC, the tetrahedral interstitial site is surrounded by 4 Si atoms. Therefore, we estimate the electro-static potential at the interstitial site to be $-0.6 \times 4=-2.4$ eV at most, based on the analysis of the isolated atom. Its absolute value is too small to explain the appearance of the floating state at the level of the $3.0$ eV below the vacuum state.

In (a), the positions of the Si ion and the interstitial sites are represented by a pink dot and red squares. It is apparent that valence electrons distributes around the ion with spherical symmetry, and thus showing spherical-symmetric electrostatic potential. However, in real $sp^3$-bonded systems, electrons don't distribute around the nucleus with spherical symmetry. Therefore, we consider a more realistic model, which mimics the $sp^3$-nonspherical electron distribution, to analyze the electrostatic potential at the interstitial sites.

%0 or quite small, due to the Gauss theorem. In fact, isolated carbon atom has the electrostatic potential of only 0.4 eV lower than the vacuum level at the distance of 1.9?Afrom the nucleus, Fig. 12. Its quite small, because the interstitial sites in sp3-bonded materials are surrounded by 4 atoms in 3C structure, for example. In both case, the electrostatic potential at the interstitial sites is at most 2 eV lower than vacuum level. Its not appropriate.

%Another possible theory is that non-spherical-electron distribution is a essential to lower the electrostatic potential at interstitial sites. In $sp^3$-bonded materials, each atom makes bonds with neighbor atoms, thus realizing a non-spherical potential. In order to investigate the effects of the non-spherical-electron distribution on the electro-static potential at the interstitial sites, we have performed a simple model calculation. 
%Yet in $sp^3$-bonded materials, each atom forms four bonds with its neighbors located with tetrahedral symmetry. Hence the electrostatic potential is certainly non-spherical. To mimic the situation, we adopt a simple model in which a point charge of $+4$ is surrounded by four $-1$ point charges located with tetrahedral symmetry, as shown in Fig.~\ref{modelpot} (b1). The former charge corresponds to the charge distribution of Si nucleus and core electrons, whereas the latter charge corresponds to valence-electron bond charges. The distance between the positive and the negative charge is set to be a half of the bond length. As is clearly seen in 
%Fig.~\ref{modelpot} (b), the Coulomb potential made by a nucleus with +4 charge, and four electrons with $-$1 charge. We treat an electron as a point charge, and the electrons positions are located at the tetrahedral sites. The tetrahedral sites represent, of course, the configuration of $sp^3$ bonds. As is clearly seen in 
%the Fig.~\ref{modelpot} (b2), the electro-static potential is non-spherical, and the negative part of the potential expands to the tetrahedral interstitial sites, which is marked by the red squares. Thus, the non-spherical-charge distribution makes the potential at the interstitial sites lower, showing the electro-static potential at the interstitial sites 2 eV lower than the vacuum level. By considering that the interstitial sites are surrounded by 4 atoms in the $3C$-SiC, we have estimated the electrostatic potential at the interstitial site to be $2 \times 4 =$ 8.0 eV lower than the vacuum level. Significant lowering takes place. This estimated value is roughly consistent with the effective potential in the DFT calculation of the $3C$-SiC: $-12.3167$ ($-9.757$) eV at the interstitial sites surrounded by Si (C) atoms. We have found that non-spherical-electron distribution plays important roles in the appearance of the floating state at the CBM. Here we have neglected the effects of the charge transfer in the $3C$-SiC for simplicity. %When the interstitial sites form a line, and make channels, then the potential in the channels is below the vacuum level significantly. Therefore, the appearance of floating states is derived from non-spherical charge distributions.

%Next, we discuss the substantial band-gap variation in the $2H$-diamond. In the case of diamond, drastic decrease of 0.84 eV occurs in the $2H$ polytype: i.e. the band gap in the $3C$-diamond is 4.246 eV, while that in the $2H$-diamond is 3.406 eV. As mentioned in the Sec.~\ref{result_2H}, the energy-gap variation comes from the structural difference around the interstitial sites between the $3C$ and $2H$ structures: i.e., each interstitial site in the $2H$ structure is surrounded by six nearest neighbor (NN) atoms, and six next NN atoms, and that in the $3C$ polytype is surrounded by four NN, and three next NN atoms. These structural difference causes the electro-static potential at the interstitial sites in the $2H$ structure lower than that in the $3C$ by $-12.349 - (-12.938) = 0.589$ eV, which corresponds to the band-gap variation in the $2H$ polytype, 0.8 eV [See Table.~\ref{2H-diamond-pot}]. 

%From the analysis of the isolated carbon atom, the electro-static potential at the distance of 1.54\AA, which corresponds to the distance between the interstitial site and the NN atom in the $3C$-diamond, is estimated to be $-0.614$ eV. Therefore, electro-static potential at the interstitial site is calculated to be $-0.614\times 4=-2.4564$ eV. On the other hand, the potential at the distance of 1.64 \AA\ from the nucleus, which represents the distance between the interstitial site and NN atom in the $2H$-diamond, is $-0.450$ eV. In the same way as in the $3C$-dimaond, electro-static potential at the interstitial site is $-0.450 \times 6=-2.700$ eV, which is lower than that in the $3C$-diamond by $0.245$ eV. From the rough estimation, it has been clarified that the potential difference of the two polytypes at the interstitial site comes from its difference in surrounding environments.

%The relative difference of the electro-static potential has succeeded to be explained by the above model. The absolute value of the potential, however, is too small, compared with the effective potential in the DFT calculation: the potential at the interstitial site is $-12.349$ eV in the $3C$ polytype and $-12.938$ eV in the $2H$. We have calculated the potential again using the $sp^3$ model. The electro-static potential at the distance of 1.54 (1.64) \AA\ from the nucleus is $-2.265$ ($-1.830$) eV, respectively. The estimated potential at the interstitial site is $-2.265 \times 4 = -9.061$ eV in the $3C$ polytype, and $-1.830 \times 6 = -10.979$ eV in the $2H$, which are much lower than those in the isolated atom model. The potential at the $2H$ polytype is 1.918 eV lower than that in the $3C$. We have found that non-spherical electron distribution plays important roles in the effective potential.

%From both models, it has been clarified that the potential at the interstitial site in the $2H$ is lower than that in the $3C$, because of the difference of the surrounding environments. In addition, we have found that the much lower potential than the vacuum level comes from the non-spherical electron distribution. 
%This may show that we should take into account the non-spherical charge distribution. Then we have performed a simple model calculation. Fig. 12 shows 



%To make the energy level of floating states lower than the vacuum level, the electrostatic potential at the interstitial sites should be lower than vacuum level. Yet, if the charge distribution of core electrons has a spherical symmetry, then the potential at the interstitial sites is 0 or quite small, due to the Gauss' theorem. In fact, isolated carbon atom has the electrostatic potential of only 0.4 eV lower than the vacuum level at the distance of 1.9\AA  from the nucleus, Fig.~\ref{modelpot}. It's quite small, because the interstitial sites in $sp^3$-bonded materials are surrounded by 4 atoms in $3C$ structure, for example. In both case, the electrostatic potential at the interstitial sites is at most 2 eV lower than vacuum level. It's not appropriate. 

%Another possible theory is that non-spherical-charge distribution is a essential to lower the electrostatic potential at interstitial sites. In $sp^3$-bonded materials, each atom makes bonds with neighbor atoms, realizing the $non$spherical potential. This may show that we should take into account the non-spherical charge distribution. Then we have performed a simple model calculation. Fig.~\ref{modelpot} shows the Coulomb potential made by a nucleus with +4 charge, and four electrons with -1 charge. The electrons' positions are the tetrahedral sites, and we take electron as a point charge. Tetrahedral sites represent, of course, the configuration of $sp^3$ bonds. From the figure, the non-spherical-charge distribution clearly makes the potential at the interstitial sites lower, and the potential is about $2$ eV lower than that of vacuum level. In $sp^3$-bonded materials, the interstitial sites are surrounded by 4 atoms in $3C$, for example, and the potential at the interstitial sites made by the neighbor atoms is linear combination of them, i.e., $8.0$ eV lower than the vacuum level. Significant lowering is possible. 

%We have found that non spherical charge distribution makes the electrostatic potential at the interstitial sites lower. When the interstitial sites form a line, and make channels, then the potential in the channels is below the vacuum level significantly. Therefore, the appearance of floating states is derived from non-spherical charge distributions. 


%\section{Pressure effects on floating states}
%In this section, we examine the pressure dependence of floating states. We have focused on the response of the floating state to the isotropic pressure, and we don't consider the possibility of the structural transition derived from the pressure. First, consider the behavior of the electronic band structures, based on the conventional atomic-orbital picture. Under the pressurized circumstances, atoms are closer to each other, thus making stronger bonds. This fact imspires us that larger energy gap between the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. For example, consider the two-site tight-binding model with hopping $t$. The energy gap is estimated to be $2t$, and each band width is also $2t$. This simple model predicts that the energy gap and the band width become larger with increasing the pressure. %In pressurized $sp^3$-bonded system, interstitial sites are closer to the nucleus.

%Fig.~\ref{3C-SiC-band-pressure} shows the calculated band structures of the $3C$-SiC with reducing the lattice constant down to $75$ \% with respect to the values of the Table.~\ref{structural parameter} with $5$ \% increments. First, it has been found that the band widths of the valence bands get larger with increasing the pressure. %This is consistent with the prediction above. This tendency is understandable in the following manner. If characteristics of each wave function are not changed under the pressurized environment, kinetic energy of each wave function is scaled by the order of $1/x^2$, where the variable $x$ represents the scale factor of the lattice constant. This is because when the system size is scale by $x$, the wave length (wave number) of the wave function is also scaled by $x$ ($1/x$). Therefore, the kinetic energy of the wave function is scaled by $1/x^2$. In fact, Fig.~\re{} shows the scaling relation of the kinetic energy clearly. Fig.~\ref{}(a) shows the raw data of the kinetic energy for each Kohn-Sham orbital at $M$ point in $a=a_0$ and $a=0.75a_0$ case. In the Fig.~\ref{}(b), we scale the kinetic energy in the $a=a_0$ by $1. 
%The valence-band width in the $a=0.75a_0$ is 14.358 eV, which is 1.70 times larger than that in the $a=a_0$. This tendency is consistent with what we consider. %In addition, Fig.~\ref{}(a) shows the kinetic energy of each KS orbital at $M$ point, showing substantial kinetic energy gain of the floating state. Fig.~\ref{}(b) shows the 
%Yet, it is noteworthy that the band gaps behave in quite different way from the simple consideration. As is clearly seen, the energy level at the CBM shifts downwards, showing narrower band gaps. Fig.~\ref{3C-SiC-bandgap-pressure} shows the calculated energy gaps with respect to the valence band top for several high-symmetrical $k$ points. In particular, it has been found that the behavior of the CBM at $M$ point is peculiar than that of other $k$ points. This is thought to be due to the potential energy gain at the interstitial sites. The interstitial sites come closer to the nucleus under the pressurized condition, and the potential at the interstitial sites is lower and lower, as is expected from the Fig.~\ref{modelpot}(b). In fact, Fig.~\ref{potential_interstitial_site} shows the electro-static potential at the interstitial sites, and thus potential-energy gain is apparent. Therefore, it is clear that potential-energy gain causes the floating sates shift downwards, thus showing smaller band gaps.

%We then expect that the energy-level shift of the floating state is common to other polytypes. Here we show some examples: $3C$-GaAs and $2H$-diamond. $3C$-GaAs is a III-V semiconductor, and has a direct band gap, 1.43 eV. GaAs is widely used in the manufacture of devices such as microwave frequency integrated circuits, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, %infrared light-emitting diodes, 
%laser diodes, solar cells and optical windows. Yet, the difference in the electro-negativity of component atoms of GaAs is relatively small: That of gallium is 1.81, and arsenic 2.18. This fact does not lead to appearance of floating state at the CBM at $X$ point of the $3C$-GaAs. Yet, surprisingly the floating state appear at the CBM at $X$ point, and shifts downwards under the pressurized condition (See Fig.~\ref{3C-GaAs-CBM}), because of the electro-static potential gain at the interstitial sites. Fig.~\ref{3C-GaAs-band-pressure} shows the result. In particular, it is noteworthy that owing to the competition with the electrostatic energy gain from the cation tetrahedron which makes the energy of the floating state at $X$ point low, the transition between the direct gap in the no-pressurized structure and the indirect gap in the pressurized structure takes place. This fact is consistent with experimental facts \cite{Lifshitz} [Fig.~\ref{3C-GaAs-expt}].

%Another interesting system is the pressurized $2H$-diamond. Fig.~\ref{2H-diamond-band-pressure} shows the calculated band structures of $2H$-diamond. The floating state at $K$ point shifts downwards substantially and causes a transition from the indirect-gap semiconductor to a semimetal. The Kohn-Sham orbital at the CBM of the $2H$-diamond at the $a=0.75a_0$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{2H-diamond-pressure}. We have found apparent floating character.

\section{Conclusions}
We have performed electronic structure calculations to explore the band gap dependence on polytypes for $sp^3$-bonded semiconducting materials, i.e., SiC, AlN, BN, GaN, Si, and diamond. We have found that band-gap variation is common in $sp^3$-bonded semiconductors; SiC, AlN, and BN exhibit smallest band gaps in $3C$ structure, whereas diamond does in $2H$ structure. We have also clarified that the microscopic mechanism of the band-gap variations is attributed to peculiar electron states $floating$ in internal channel space at the conduction-band minimum (CBM), and that channel length and electro-static potential in channel space affect the energy level of the floating states; In compound semiconductors, charge transfer causes the elecro-static potential in channel lower in $3C$ structure, while elemental semiconductors show lower electro-static potential in $2H$ rather than in $3C$.

%bibitem{bandgap}
%Overall features of the calculated bands are in accord with the experiment, though the energy gaps are underestimated substantially as is characteristic of GGA. Yet, the relative difference in the energy gap among the poly- morphs is well reproduced: In SiC, our GGA calculations provide the band gaps of 1.42, 2.08, and 2.36 eV for $3C$, $6H$, and $2H$ structures, whereas the corresponding experimental values are 2.40, 3.10, and 3.33 eV, as re- ported in Ref. [onlinecite{Harris}]. The quantitative description of the energy gaps, which is unnecessary in the present work, may be possible using the hybrid functional for the exchange-correlation energy cite{Matsushita}.
