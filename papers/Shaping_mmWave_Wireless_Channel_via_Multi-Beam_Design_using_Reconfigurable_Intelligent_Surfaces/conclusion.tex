\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
RIS can be incorporated into mmWave communications to fill the coverage gaps in the blind-spots of the mmWave system. We proposed a novel approach for designing RIS employing a UPA antenna structure, that is capable of covering multiple disjoint angular intervals simultaneously. Both our theoretical results and numerical experiments demonstrate that our technique termed as multi-beamforming will result in sharp, high, and stable gains within the desired ACI's regardless of their spatial locations, while effectively, suppressing all the undesired out-of-band components.
