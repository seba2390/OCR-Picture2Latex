\begin{abstract}
Photometric stereo is a method for estimating the normal vectors of an object from images of the object under varying lighting conditions. Motivated by several recent works that extend photometric stereo to more general objects and lighting conditions, we study a new robust approach to photometric stereo that utilizes dictionary learning. Specifically, we propose and analyze two approaches to adaptive dictionary regularization for the photometric stereo problem. First, we propose an image preprocessing step that utilizes an adaptive dictionary learning model to remove noise and other non-idealities from the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. We also propose an alternative model where we directly apply the adaptive dictionary regularization to the normal vectors themselves during estimation. We study the practical performance of both methods through extensive simulations, which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of both methods in the presence of noise.

\vspace{-1mm}
In this work, we investigated two dictionary learning based methods for robust photometric stereo. Each method seeks to represent some form of our data---either the original images or the estimated normal vectors---as sparse with respect to an adaptive (learned) dictionary. We showed that both approaches are significantly more robust to noise than existing methods. The results presented here indicate that DLPI usually outperforms DLNV, but which method performs best in general may depend on underlying properties of the data. We leave this nuanced investigation for future work.
