\section{Transport schemes for arbitrary meshes}
\label{sec:transport}
The transport of a dependent variable $\phi$ in a prescribed, non-divergent velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ is given by the equation		
\begin{align}		
	\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{u} \phi \right) = 0 \text{ .} \label{eqn:advection}		
\end{align}
The time derivative is discretised using a two-stage, second-order Heun method,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\phi^\star &= \phi^{(n)} + \Delta t \: g(\phi^{(n)}) \\
	\phi^{(n+1)} &= \phi^{(n)} + \frac{\Delta t}{2} \left[ g(\phi^{(n)}) + g(\phi^{\star}) \right]
\end{align} \label{eqn:heun}
\end{subequations}
where \(g(\phi^{(n)}) = - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{u} \phi^{(n)})\) at time level \(n\).  The same time-stepping method is used for both the cubicFit scheme and the multidimensional linear upwind scheme.
Although the Heun method is unstable for a linear oscillator \citep{durran2013} and for solving the transport equation using centred, linear differencing, it is stable when it is used for transport schemes with \revtwo{sufficient upwinding}.

Using the finite volume method, the velocity field is prescribed at face centroids and the dependent variable is stored at cell centroids.  The divergence term in equation~\eqref{eqn:advection} is discretised using Gauss's theorem:
\begin{align}
	\nabla \cdot \left( \mathbf{u} \phi \right) \approx \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}_c} \sum_{f \in\:c} \mathbf{u}_f \cdot \mathbf{S}_f \phi_F \label{eqn:gauss-div}
\end{align}
where subscript $f$ denotes a value stored at a face and subscript $F$ denotes a value approximated at a face from surrounding values.  $\mathcal{V}_c$ is the cell volume, $\mathbf{u}_f$ is a velocity vector prescribed at a face, ${\mathbf{S}_f}$ is the surface area vector with a direction outward normal to the face and a magnitude equal to the face area, $\phi_F$ is an approximation of the dependent variable at the face, and $\sum_{f \in\:c}$ denotes a summation over all faces $f$ bordering cell $c$.
Note that equation~\eqref{eqn:gauss-div} is a second-order approximation of the divergence term which limits the cubicFit transport scheme to second-order numerical convergence.

This discretisation is applicable to arbitrary meshes.  A necessary condition for stability is given by the multidimensional Courant number,
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Co}_c = \frac{\Delta t}{2 \mathcal{V}_c} \sum_{f \in\: c} \lvert \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{S}_f \rvert \label{eqn:co}
\end{align}
such that $\mathrm{Co}_c \leq 1$ for all cells $c$ in the domain.  Hence, stability is constrained by the maximum Courant number of any cell in the domain.

The accurate approximation of the dependent variable at the face, $\phi_F$, is key to the overall accuracy of the transport scheme. The cubicFit scheme and multidimensional linear upwind scheme differ in their approximations, and these approximation \revone{methods are described} next.

\subsection{Multidimensional linear upwind transport scheme}
The multidimensional linear upwind scheme, called ``linearUpwind'' hereafter, is documented here since it provides a baseline accuracy for the experiments in section~\ref{sec:results}.  The approximation of $\phi_F$ is calculated using a gradient reconstruction,
\begin{align}
	\phi_F &= \phi_u + \nabla_c\: \phi \cdot \left(\mathbf{x}_f - \mathbf{x}_c \right)
\end{align} 
where $\phi_u$ is the upwind value of $\phi$, and $\mathbf{x}_f$ and $\mathbf{x}_c$ are the position vectors of the face centroid and cell centroid respectively.
The gradient $\nabla_c \:\phi$ is calculated using Gauss' theorem:
\begin{align}
	\nabla_c\: \phi = \frac{1}{\mathcal{V}_c} \sum_{f\in\:c} \widetilde{\phi}_F \mathbf{S}_f \label{eqn:linearUpwind-grad}
\end{align}
where $\widetilde{\phi}_F$ is linearly interpolated from the two neighbouring cells of face $f$.
\revone{The resulting stencil comprises all cells sharing a face with the upwind cell, including the upwind cell itself.  For a face in the interior of a two-dimensional rectangular mesh, the stencil for the linearUpwind scheme is a `$+$' shape with 5 cells.  On the same mesh, the stencil for the cubicFit scheme is more than twice the size with 12 cells.}
For cells adjacent to boundaries having zero gradient boundary conditions, the boundary value is set to be equal to the cell centre value before equation~\eqref{eqn:linearUpwind-grad} is evaluated.
This implementation of the multidimensional linear upwind scheme is included in the OpenFOAM software distribution \citep{openfoam}.
