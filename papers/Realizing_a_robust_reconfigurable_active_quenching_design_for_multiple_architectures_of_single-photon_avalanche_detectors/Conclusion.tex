\section{Conclusion and future work}
We have described a hybrid design for a re-configurable active quench system which can be used to characterize multiple APD architectures. We have implemented the design with readily available components and characterized it with the SAP500 commercial APD cooled to -20Â°C and achieved a deadtime of 35ns while limiting the after-pulsing probability to $\approx$3\%. We have also integrated our active quench system directly with custom chip-scale APDs and presented preliminary results for variations in their breakdown voltage and dark counts w.r.t. temperature. Our active quench system can also be used in other experiments and commercial applications such as Quantum information processing, random number generators, time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and range measurement applications such as LIDAR. Looking ahead, the deadtime of the quenching system can be reduced further by using faster MOSFETs which will increase the detection rate and efficiency. The SoC firmware can be upgraded to directly compute after-pulse probability without additional equipment.
