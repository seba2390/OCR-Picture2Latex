In this work, we have presented the design and application ProgressLabeller for object pose annotation. Through comparison to LabelFusion, we show that its higher accuracy with similar labelling time, efficiency of creating a large-scale customized dataset, and potential in fine-tuning pose estimation deep neural networks for robotic grasping. In future, we can improve ProgressLabeller by adding online object model generation and support for dynamic scenes.
