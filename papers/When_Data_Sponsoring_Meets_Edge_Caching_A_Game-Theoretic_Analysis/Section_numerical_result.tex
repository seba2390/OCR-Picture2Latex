We perform numerical studies in a mobile network, and verify the equilibrium analysis. We simulate a system in which there are 10,000 mobile video users, and choose system parameters as follows: $v=3$, $c_1=1.5$, $c_2=1$, $\phi=0.1$, $u = 3$, $h_1=1.5$, $h_2=2$, $S=1000$, $\alpha_1=2000$, and $\alpha_2=2000$.



\subsection{Discussion on Parameters}

%We discuss the impact of price parameters on the equilibrium in Stage II. Without loss of generality, we set the CP's budgets as following:


	
We first discuss the impact of user sponsor revenue on users' sponsor membership decision. The user sponsor revenue is measured by the per sponsor revenue $v$. Fig.~\ref{fig:v_mu} demonstrates the user membership percentages under different user sponsor revenue $v$. We can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:v_mu} that the percentage of \textbf{HybridSp} users is monotone increasing with $v$, because the sponsorship becomes more beneficial to users, which attracts users to join both sponsorships. We notice that $\mu_N$ is monotone decreasing with $v$. From the CP's perspective, in order to attract more users to utilize the sponsorship schemes, the CP should know which contents are most valuable to users and sponsor the users with free request to the contents.


Then, we discuss the parameter $c_1$, \emph{i.e.,} the per sponsor cost in \textbf{CellSp}. Fig.~\ref{fig:c2_mu} show the user membership percentages under different cellular sponsor cost $c_1$. We can observe from Fig.~\ref{fig:c2_mu} that the percentage of users selecting \textbf{CellSp} decreases and that of users selecting \textbf{EdgeSp} increases with $c_1$. This is because users need to bear higher cost in \textbf{CellSp}, and hence some of them switch to \textbf{EdgeSp} with relatively lower cost. Note that when $c_1\ge 3$, no user will choose \textbf{CellSp}.

%With the discussion on price parameters, we notice that the prices for users influent user selection dramatically. The sponsor with lower price attracts more users. When the revenue for users is large, both sponsorship solutions benefit from this, and the Alien users in the market is reduced.


\subsection{Dynamic User Selection and Algorithm in Stage II}

Fig.~\ref{fig:dynamic2} shows the process of dynamic member selection in Stage II. Specifically, it illustrates the dynamics of membership percentages $\mu_N$, $\mu_C$, $\mu_E$, and $\mu_H$. In this example, the membership dynamics converge to the equilibrium within about $10$ iterations, the membership percentage is $\mu_N=0.09,\; \mu_C=0.28, \;\mu_E=0.21, \;\mu_H=0.42$.

\subsection{CP's Decision and Revenue in Stage I}

We now discuss how the CP can optimizes its budgets. Specifically, the CP can determine the proper $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ based on the users' equilibrium sponsorship selections.

Fig.~\ref{fig:optimal1} shows the contours of CP revenue with respect to $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$. In this case, the optimal budgets are $\alpha_1^*=0.2$ and $\alpha_2^*=0.26$. Furthermore, we investigate the CP's revenue under pure cellular sponsoring, pure cache sponsoring, and joint cellular and caching sponsoring in Fig.~\ref{fig:revenue_pure_joint}. With proper budget setting, the joint sponsor schemes can increase its maximum revenue up to $105\%$ and $85\%$, respectively, comparing with cases with pure cellular sponsoring and pure edge cache sponsoring.
