\begin{abstract}
% We present a torsion detection algorithm and build a close-loop grasping framework based on tactile sensor, where we detect the failure in the process of grasping with large torsion and use it to guide the re-grasp. 
% A common case of grasping failure is when the object is grasped at the wrong location, causing rotational displacement between the gripper and object. We develop a model-based algorithm to detect the onset of rotation and the degree of rotation from the GelSight sensing, and further use it to guide the regrasp location adjustment until the stable grasp is reached. 
% We conduct offline experiments to test our torsion detection algorithm's accuracy with ground truth and online experiments to proof the efficacy of our system. 

% \arpit{Is this a large number for regrasp tasks? If yes, then the sentence could go like "We validate our grasp-regrasp system on over a 100 grasping attempts.}

Rotational displacement about the grasping point is a common grasp failure when an object is grasped at a location away from its center of gravity. Tactile sensors with soft surfaces, such as GelSight sensors, can detect the rotation patterns on the contacting surfaces when the object rotates. In this work, we propose a model-based algorithm that detects those rotational patterns and measures rotational displacement using the GelSight sensor. We also integrate the rotation detection feedback into a closed-loop regrasping framework, which detects the rotational failure of grasp in an early stage and drives the robot to a stable grasp pose. We validate our proposed rotation detection algorithm and grasp-regrasp system on self-collected dataset and online experiments to show how our approach accurately detects the rotation and increases grasp stability. 
% We perform experiments to show how the proposed algorithm can improve grasp stability by incorporating  

% From more than one hundred times grasping, we showed our system can efficiently finish the grasp-regrasp task.
