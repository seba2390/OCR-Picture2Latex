\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have proposed a novel bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) for unbiased scene graph generation. Compared to previous methods, our main contribution consists of two key components as follows. We first develop a confidence-aware message passing mechanism for our BGNN to encode scene context in an effective manner; Moreover, we design a bi-level resampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced data distribution during the training.
The results evidently show that our BGNN achieves the superior or comparable performances over the prior state-of-the-art approaches on all three scene graph datasets.

%proving the low recognition performance on tail categories.
%Specifically, we first proposed a bipartite graph neural network to reformulate the features aggregation process between the entities and predicates.
%Secondly, we further design the adaptive information flow control mechanism during the message passing. 
%Those two design effective improves the modeling context for recognizing the low-frequency categories.
%Besides, we design a hybrid-level data resampling for scene graph generation, which produce a more balanced data distribution than other methods, and further improved the performance.
%The empirical and ablative study shows our model obtains a new SOTA on Visual Genome databases on balanced metrics mRecall@K.
