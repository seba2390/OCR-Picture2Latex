%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Scene graph generation is an important visual understanding task with a broad range of vision applications. Despite recent tremendous progress, it remains challenging due to the intrinsic long-tailed class distribution and large intra-class variation.
   To address these issues, we introduce a novel confidence-aware bipartite graph neural network with adaptive message propagation mechanism for unbiased scene graph generation. 
   In addition, we propose an efficient bi-level data resampling strategy to alleviate the imbalanced data distribution problem in training our graph network. 
   Our approach achieves superior or competitive performance over previous methods on several challenging datasets, including Visual Genome, Open Images V4/V6, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality.

%   % Our focus is to address the challenge of intrinsic long-tail distribution of visual relations in a typical scene parsing dataset and large intra-class variation of the predicate categories. 
%   Due to the difficulty to learn a visual representation directly with the severed imbalance data, effective context modeling is critical for the model to be more discriminative for recognizing the visual relationship.
%   In this work, we proposed a new scene graph generation model that effectively modeling context for recognizing the low-frequency categories.
%   We proposed a bipartite graph neural network that encodes the semantic context between the entities and predicate. Based on this structure, we further designed an adaptive dynamic message passing mechanism, that can improve the information flow quality of the message passing process. 
%   In this way, the model obtains a more effective ability to model the context information.
%   Besides, we developed a new hybrid-level resampling strategy that further improves the performance of recognizing the rare categories. 
%   We proposed method obtains a new SOTA on Visual Genome databases on balanced metrics mRecall@K.
%   The code will be released.
