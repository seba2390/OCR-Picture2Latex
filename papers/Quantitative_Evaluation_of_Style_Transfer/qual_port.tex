    \caption{To visualize EC space, we divide it into a 4x4 grid of boxes using quantiles of all E (resp. C) values for
all methods.  This grid is shown in the inset; notice boxes II and III are quite small, meaning that there are
many images with only moderate scores over all the methods.  We then obtain for each method and for each anti-diagonal
box the mediod of that methods images within the corresponding box; in some cases, there are no images for
that method in the relevant box.  We have laid these images out as a map of EC space.  Notice that the space is
reasonably consistent with intuition; images that achieve strong E and strong C are both stylish and recognizably composed
of objects; images that achieve weak E and weak C have rather poor style and do not noticeably contain objects. Note that ``No-Image'' indicates here there are no stylized image in the quantiles in portrait content; not necessary to have zero samples in landscape mode (see sec. ~\ref{ExpPro} and refer supplementary figures). Best
viewed at high resolution in color.}
