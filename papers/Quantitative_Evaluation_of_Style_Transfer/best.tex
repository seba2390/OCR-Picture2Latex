    \caption{For given easy style, which is easy style because most methods can gives high E value, the images from left column to right column respectively are generated  by {\bf ACG, Gatys, ACG with histogram loss, Gatys with histogram loss, UST(universal style transfer), and MCG}.  The rows represent different contents. %By comparing ACG to Gatys, we can roughly see the instability problem of Gatys. Comparing Gatys to Gatys+Hist, we can also see some improvement of histogram loss, but the quality of Gatys+Hist is not as good as ACG. Histogram loss seems make ACG worse. Because the UST starts from content image, it preserve better content information but poor in preserving style geometry. Because MCG can dynamically tune the style weight, it usually well preserves on both and gives good balance between style and content. MCG sometimes fails and then gives only content result, see first row of MCG.
