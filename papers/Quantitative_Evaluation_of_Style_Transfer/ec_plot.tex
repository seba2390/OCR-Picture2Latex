\caption{\em An EC plot comparing style transfers methods.  Here the C
statistic is per image Pb AUC.  Point markers show individual image
statistics, with color keyed
to the style and size keyed to the weight on the style loss (larger markers corresponds to a stronger style weight).  Notice that some styles are clearly harder than others, and produce
low E for both methods.  The curves are Loess regression curves of E against C, with shadowed regions showing one
standard error bars up and down.  For any value of C, there is strong evidence that ACG obtains on
average a larger E than Gatys' loss (about three standard errors difference); %for other methods the
%improvement is less marked, but the method is clearly stronger than all others,we show them in supplementary.   
Note that cross-layer loss achieves an E comparable with simply resizing the style image( see Fig. ~\ref{control}, style only control). A similar plot can be obtained by choosing C as segment divergence by plotting largest eigenvalues against E (plots in supplementary material). Best viewed in color.}
