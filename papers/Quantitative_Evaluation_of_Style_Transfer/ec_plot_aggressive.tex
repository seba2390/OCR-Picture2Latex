\caption{\em An EC plot comparing Gatys' method to cross-layer style transfer for the aggressive weight dataset. Notice that large weights cause serious trouble for
Gatys' method (large diamonds clustered in the bottom left corner). This is very likely an effect of the symmetry in the loss function (text in section \ref{sec:symmetry}).
Cross-layer style transfer outperforms Gatys' method over all of its range, mostly by many
standard errors. Scale is the same as Figure \protect \ref{ecxvg}.   }
