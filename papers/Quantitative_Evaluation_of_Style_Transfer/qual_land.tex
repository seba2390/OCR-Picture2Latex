Mediods from different blocks in the EC plot for five style transfer methods reveal the semantics of the EC statistics.
We divided the EC plot into a 4x4 grid, using quantiles of values of E and C over all methods.
Each {\bf row} corresponds to a different block along the diagonal in this grid, ranging from bottom left grid box
(with lowest E and C, so worst, {\bf top row}) to top right (with highest E and C, so best, {\bf bottom row}).
Each {\bf column} represents a method, in order from left to right: {\bf ACG}, {\bf Gatys}, {\bf ACG+Histogram}, {\bf Gatys+Histogram}, {\bf UST}.
