%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
A popular series of style transfer methods apply a style to a content image by controlling mean and covariance of values in early layers of a feature stack. This is insufficient for transferring styles that have strong structure across spatial scales like, e.g., textures where dots lie on long curves. This paper demonstrates that controlling inter-layer correlations yields visible improvements in style transfer methods.  We achieve this control by computing cross-layer, rather than within-layer, gram matrices. We find that (a) cross-layer gram matrices are sufficient to control within-layer statistics. Inter-layer correlations improves style transfer and texture synthesis. The paper shows numerous examples on "hard" real style transfer problems (e.g. long scale and hierarchical patterns); (b) a fast approximate style transfer method can control cross-layer gram matrices; (c) we demonstrate that multiplicative, rather than additive style and content loss, results in very good style transfer. Multiplicative loss produces a visible emphasis on boundaries, and means that one hyper-parameter can be eliminated.   
\end{abstract}




\section{Introduction}

Style transfer methods apply the ``style'' from one example image to the ``content'' of another; for instance, one might render a camera image (the content) as a watercolor painting (the style). Recent work has shown that highly effective style transfer can be achieved by searching for an image such that early layers of CNN representation match  
the early layers of the style image and later layers match the later
layers of a content image~\cite{gatys2016image}. Content matching is
by comparing unit outputs at each location of feature map. But style
matching is achieved by comparing summary statistics -- in particular,
the gram matrix -- of the layers individually. Comparing gram matrices
of individual layers ensures that small, medium and large patterns
that are common in the style image appear with about the same
frequency in the synthesized image, and that spatial co-occurences
between these patterns are about the same in synthesized and style
image.  Novak and Nikulin noticed that across-layer gram matrices reliably produce improvement on style
transfer. (\cite{novak2016improving}). However, their work was an exploration of variants of style transfer rather than
a thorough study to gain insights on style summary statistics.   In this paper, we show (a) methods to evaluate style
transfer quantitatively and (b) strong evidence, both experimental and theoretical, that cross-layer gram matrices
produce better style transfers.

% There are reasons cross-layer terms produce
% improvements. In some styles, very long scale patterns are formed out of small components.  For instance, in
% Figure~\ref{fig:cf1}, small white spots are organized into long curves. Within-layer gram matrices are not well adapted
% to represent this phenomenon, as Figure~\ref{fig:cf1} shows. Generally, such hard styles occur where effects at short
% spatial scales are organized into longer scale structures. Such hard styles are strongly associated with physical
% materials (for instance, relief painting in Figure~\ref{fig:mulloss_comp}).  In this paper, we show that comparing
% cross-layer gram matrices -- which encode co-occurrences between (say) small and medium scale patterns --- produces
% improvements in style transfer for such styles. Furthermore, controlling cross-layer gram matrices also effectively
% controls pattern frequencies.  

\textbf{Our contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item We offer comprehensive quantitative evaluation procedures for style transfer methods. We evaluate style transfers on
two criteria.  {\bf Effectiveness} measures whether transferred images have the desired style, using divergence between
feature layer distributions.  {\bf Coherence} measures whether the resulting images respect the underlying
decomposition of the content image into objects, using established procedures togeher with the Berkeley segmentation
dataset, and also using a novel measure of segment divergence.
\item We use our measures to compare several style transfer methods quantitatively.  In particular, 
we show that controlling cross-layer, rather than within-layer, gram matrices produces quantitative  improvements in
style transfer over the original method due to Gatys~\cite{}.  Further, multiplying, rather than adding, style and
content losses produces notable further improvements.  
\item We construct good explicit models of the symmetry groups for Gatys' style loss and the cross-layer style loss 
(improving over Risser \ea~\cite{}, who could not construct the groups).  We show experimental evidence that 
the quantitative improvement over Gatys is due to the difference in symmetry groups.
\item We show qualitative evidence suggesting that these quantitative improvements manifest in real images.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}
Bilinear models are capable of simple image style transfer~\cite{Tenenbaum2000} by factorizing style and content representations, but non-parametric methods like patch-based texture synthesis can deal with much more complex texture fields~\cite{Efros2001}.  Image analogies
use a rendering of one image in two styles to infer a mapping from a content image to a stylized
image~\cite{Hertzmann2001}. Researchers have been looking for versatile parametric methods to control style patterns at
different scales to be transferred. Adjusting filter statistics is known to yield texture
synthesis~\cite{debonet,simoncelli}.  Gatys \ea demonstrated that producing neural network layers with particular
summary statistics (i.e Gram matrices) yielded effective texture synthesis~\cite{NIPS2015_5633}. In a following paper,
Gatys \ea achieved style transfer by searching for an image that satisfies both style texture summary statistics and
content constraints~\cite{gatys2016image}. This work has been much elaborated. The search can be replaced with a
regression (at one scale~\cite{Johnson2016Perceptual}; at multiple scales~\cite{wang2016multimodal}; with
cached~\cite{chen2017stylebank} or learned~\cite{dumoulin2016learned} style representations) or a decoding process that
allows efficient adjusting of statistics~\cite{UST}. Search can be sped up with local matching
methods~\cite{chen2016fast}. Methods that produce local maps (rather than pixels) result in photorealistic style
transfer~\cite{Shih2014,Luan2017}. Style transfer can be localized to masked regions~\cite{gatys2016controlling}. The
criterion of matching summary statistics is a Maximum Mean Discrepancy condition~\cite{li2017demystifying}. Style
transfer can be used to enhance sketches~\cite{champandard2016semantic}.  

Novak and Nikulin search a range of variant style transfer methods, including cross-layer gram matrices. However, their
primary suggestions are adding more layers for more features, and shifting activations such that the number of zero
entries in gram matrix is reduced. They don't pursue on cross-layer gram matrices nor explain its results. They
experiment on a long chain of cross-layer gram matrices but do not identify what the improvements are or extend the
method to fast style transfer~\cite{novak2016improving}.  There is a comprehensive review in~\cite{jing2017neural}. 

We are not aware of quantitative evaluations of the competence style transfer apart from user studies~\cite{} (speed is
evaluated in~\cite{}).  But quick adjustments to a method using user studies is difficult in practice.  

{\bf Notation:} We review the original work of Gatys \ea in detail to introduce notation.
Gatys \ea \cite{gatys2016image} finds an image where early layers of a CNN representation match the lower layers of the style image and higher layers match the higher layers of a content image.  Write $I_{s}$ (resp. $I_{c}$, $I_{n}$)  for the style (resp. content, new) image,
and $\alpha$ for some parameter balancing style and content losses ($L_s$ and $L_c$ respectively).  Occasionally, we
will write $I_n^m(I_c, I_s)$ for the image resulting from style transfer using method $m$ applied to the arguments.
We obtain $I_{n}$ by finding
\[
\argmax{I_{n}} L_c(I_{n}, I_{c})+\alpha L_s(I_{n}, I_{c})
\]
Losses are computed on a network representation, with $L$ convolutional layers, where the $l$'th layer
produces a feature map $f^l$ of size $H^l \times W^l \times C^l$ (resp. height, width, and channel number). We partition
the layers into three groups (style, content and irrelevant). Then we reindex the spatial variables (height and width) and
write $f^l_{k,p}$ for the response of the $k$'th channel at the  $p$'th location in the $l$'th convolutional layer. The
content loss $L_c$ is 
\[
L_c(I_{n}, I_{c}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{c} \sum_{k,p} \norm{f^c_{k,p}(I_{n}) - f^c_{k,p}(I_{c})}^2
\]
(where $c$ ranges over content layers). The {\em within-layer gram
  matrix} for the $l$'th layer is
\[
G_{ij}^l(I) = \sum_p \left[f_{i,p}^l(I)\right]\left[f_{j,p}^l(I)\right]^{T}.
\]
Write $w_l$ for the weight applied to the $l$'th layer.  Then 
\[
L_s^l(I_{n}, I_{s}) = \frac{1}{4{N^l}^2{M^l}^2}\sum_{s}w_l \sum_{i,j}\norm{G^s_{ij}(I_{n})-G^s_{ij}(I_{s})}^2
\]
where $s$ ranges over style layers. Gatys \ea use Relu1\_1, Relu2\_1, Relu3\_1, Relu4\_1, and Relu5\_1 as style layers, and layer Relu4\_2 
for the content loss, and search for $I_{n}$ using L-BFGS~\cite{liu1989limited}.  From now on, we write R51 for Relu5\_1, etc. 

\section{Quantitative Evaluation of Style Transfer}

A style transfer method should meet two basic tests.  The first is {\bf effectiveness} -- does the
method produce images in the desired style? The second is {\bf coherence} -- do the resulting images respect the
underlying decomposition of the content image into objects?   While final judgement should belong to the artist, we
construct numerical proxies that can be used to disqualify methods from a final user study. It is essential to test both
properties (excellent results on coherence can be obtained by simply not transferring style at all).
In general, we will apply different treatments to the same set of
images, and measure the difference in some statistic that captures the
effect of the treatment (in contrast to true treatment effects, which are complicated by the difficulty of applying two
treatments to one patient~\cite{}).   

{\bf Effectiveness:}  Assume that a style is applied to a content
image  We would like to measure the extent to which the result reflects the style.  There is good evidence that 
the distribution of features within lower feature layers of a CNN representation is an effective proxy for style.  We
expect that individual content images might need to have small biases in the distribution of feature layers to account
for the content, but over many images the distribution of features should reflect the style distribution.  In turn, a
strong measure of effectiveness of style transfer for a particular image is the extent to which the distribution of
feature layer values produced by the transferred image matches the corresponding distribution for the style image.
In notation, write $\vect{f}^{l}_{p}(I)$ for the vector of responses  of all channels  at the  $p$'th location in the $l$'th
convolutional layer for image $I$.   Now choose the $i$'th content image, the $j$'th style, and some method $m$.  The
distribution $P_{t, m}$ of $\vect{f}^{l}(I^m_n(I_c^i,I_s^j))$ should be similar to  the distribution $P_s$ of
$\vect{f}^{l}(I_s^j)$, with perhaps some smoothing  resulting from the need to meet content demands.   

Testing whether two datasets come from the same, unknown, distribution in high dimensions remains tricky (the method
of~\cite{gretton} is the current best alternative).  We do not expect the distributions to be exactly the same anyhow;
instead, we want to identify obvious (and so suspicious) large  differences. The symmetry analysis below suggests that
Gatys' original method will massively increase the variance of  $\vect{f}^{l}(I^g_n(I_c^i,I_s^j))$.  Observing major differences is
straightforward with relatively crude tools.   However, dimension is a problem.  Even assuming that each distribution is
normal,  computing KL divergences is impractical, because the distributions are large and so the estimates of the
covariance matrices are unreliable.   

However, we seek a statistic that is large with high probability when $P_{t,m}$ and $P_s$ are strongly different, and 
small with high probability when they are similar.  A straightforward construction, after~\cite{Schwing} is as follows .
%Choose a set of content images $I_{c}^{i}$ and of style images $I_{s}^{j}$.   
We use the following statistic.  Write $\vect{v}_k$ for a random unit vector.  We then compute
$p_p^m=\vect{v}_k^T\vect{f}_p^{l}(I^m_n(I_c^i,I_s^j))$ and $p_p^s=\vect{v}_k^T\vect{f}_p^{l}(I_s^j)$.  We assume that
these scalar datasets are normally distributed, and compute KL divergence $d(\vect{v}_k)$ from the style distribution to the transferred
distribution.  We now average over $R$ random unit vectors and form
\[
E=-\log \left(\frac{1}{R} \sum_k d(\vect{v}_k)\right)
\]
Large values of this statistic are obtained if there are few random directions in which the two distributions differ;
small values suggest there are many such directions and so that the style transfer may not have succeeded.

{\bf Coherence:} A style transfer method that obliterates object boundaries would make it hard for humans to interpret
the output images, so a reasonable measure of a style transfer method is the extent to which it preserves object
boundaries.  We have two measures of coherence.  Our {\em boundary preservation} measure computes the extent to which a
boundary prediction algorithm produces true object boundaries for a given method, using the Berkeley segmentation
dataset tests~\cite{}.  Our {\em object coherence} measure computes the extent to which textures are (a) coherent within object
boundaries and (b) distinct from object to object.

{\em Boundary preservation} is evaluated as a straightforward application of existing methods to evaluate image boundary 
predictors.  We choose a boundary predictor (we used the Pb of~\cite{}); we apply the style transfer method to images
from the BSD, using multiple style images,  to obtain transferred images; we apply the boundary predictor to the
transferred images; and we compute the AUC of the resulting boundary predictions.  A higher AUC suggests better boundary
preservation.  As section~\ref{results} shows, this measure is highly variable depending on the style that is
transferred, and so we compute a per-transferred image AUC.

This evaluation method is not perfect.  Heavily textured styles may confuse Pb without confusing human viewers, because
Pb was not built with very aggressive texture fields in  mind (compare typical style transfer images with the ``natural''
textures used to build Pb).  In particular, we might have texture fields that are strongly coherent within each object
region and different from region to region, but where Pb has great difficulty identifying object boundaries.  An object
coherence measure is easy to obtain using the BSD dataset, because each image comes with a ground truth segmentation
mask.  We choose some layer $l$, and write $\vect{f}_{S,i}=\vect{f}_{i}^{l}(I^g_n(I_c^i,I_s^j), S)$ (for brevity) for a feature
vector in that layer within some segment $S$, and $\left\{\vect{f}_{S,i}\right\}$ for all such feature
vectors.  Write $\mu_S=\mean{\vect{f}_S}$, and $\Sigma_b=\covmat{\mu_S}$ for the between class covariance matrix.
Assume that each segment has the same covariance (heteroskedasticity,
a tolerable assumption given that the method tries to impose a gram matrix on the layer), and construct the within-class
covariance $\Sigma_w=\covmat{\vect{f}_{1,1}-\mu_1, \ldots \vect{f}_{n_S,n_f(S)}-\mu_{n_S}}$.  Now the
largest generalized eigenvalue $\lambda^{\mbox{max}}$ of $(\Sigma_b, \Sigma_w)$ measures the dispersion of the region
textures.   Notice that $\lambda^{\mbox{max}}\geq 0$, and simple plots (supplementary materials) suggest this has a
log-normal distribution over multiple style/content pairs.  We therefore use $L_m=\log \lambda^{\mbox{max}}_{m}$ as a
score to evaluate a method.  Larger values suggest more successful separation of regions.

\section{Style Transfer Methods}\label{sec:Cross}

We investigate three methods.  {\bf Within-layer}  is Gatys' method, described in section~\ref{} while introducing notation.

{\bf Between layer, additive} loss is obtained as follows.  Consider layer $l$ and $m$, both style layers, with decreasing
spatial resolution.  
Write $\uparrow f^{m}$ for an upsampling of  $f^m$ to $H^l\times W^l \times K^l$, and consider
\[
G_{ij}^{l,m}(I) = \sum_{p} \left[ f_{i,p}^l(I)\right]\left[\uparrow {f}_{j,p}^{m}(I)\right]^{T}.
\]
as the cross-layer gram matrix, We can form a style loss
\[
L_s(I, I_{s}) = \sum_{(l, m)\in {\cal L}} w^{l}\sum_{ij} \norm{G^{l,m}_{ij}(I)-G^{l,m}_{ij}(I_s)}^2
\]
(where ${\cal L}$ is a set of pairs of style layers).   We can substitute this loss into the original style loss, and
minimize as before. 

{\bf Between layer, multiplicative:} Style transfer methods require a choice of parameter, $\alpha$, to balance the style and content losses.   The value is
typically chosen by eye, which is unsatisfying.  A natural alternative to adding the losses is to multiply them; in this
case, no parameter is needed, and we can form
\[
L^m(I_n) = L_c(I_n, I_c) *  L_s(I_n, I_s).
\]
Multiplicative loss tends to emphasize strong boundaries in the content image( Figure~\ref{fig:MulCG}). We believe this
is because style loss is always large, so that minimization will force down large differences (which are large
difference in values between stylized image and content image) in the content layer.  Our experimental results suggest
that this approach is successful (section~\ref{sec:mul}).  The effect is quite prominent (Figure~\ref{fig:MulCG},
Figure~\ref{fig:scale2}, Figure~\ref{fig:scale3} ), multiplicative loss has significant advantage of reducing the number
of parameters that need to be searched over to produce useful results.  Figure~\ref{fig:mulloss_comp} shows style
transfer results using cross-layer gram matrices and multiplicative loss, we observe distinguishable improvement over
Gatys' method in preserving content boundaries.  {\em WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?} We find one trick to improve transfer results using multiplicative loss by shifting the mean when creating the new image
to optimized, we recommend this shift should be the channel mean of style image.

{\bf Configuration details:}  In principle, any set of {\em style layer pairs} can be used.  We have investigated a {\em pairwise descending}
strategy, where one constrains each layer and its successor (i.e. (R51, R41); (R41, R31); etc) and an {\em all distinct pairs}
strategy, where one constrains all pairs of distinct layers.  {\em Weighting} within-layer gram matrix methods properly
seems to be important, perhaps ensuring that patterns at a particular scale are ``appropriate''.   Carefully controlling
weights for each layer's style loss is not necessary in cross-layer gram matrix scenario.    {\em Constraint counts} for 
between layer gram matrix methods are much lower than for within layer methods.  For a pairwise descending strategy, 
we have four cross-layer gram matrices, leading to  control of $64\times
128+128\times 256+256\times 512+512\times 512 = 434176 $ parameters; compare within layer gram matrices, which control 
$64^2+128^2+256^2+2\times512^2 = 610304$ parameters.  It may seem that there is less constraint on style.  Experiment
suggests our method produces visible improved results, meaning that many of the parameters controlled by within-layer
gram matrices have no particular effect on the outcome.   This is consistent with the symmetry argument below.

% \subsection{Fast Universal Cross-layer Transfers}

% Li \ea use signal whitening and coloring to implement a fast version of style transfer using a VGG encoder~\cite{UST}.  Their procedure takes
% the R51 layer from the content image, then applies an affine transformation (by whitening, coloring, and matching means) to match the gram matrix of the corresponding layer computed for the style image.  The resulting layer is decoded to an image through one of five pre-trained image reconstruction decoder networks. The R41 layer produced by this image is again affine transformed to match the gram matrix of the corresponding layer computed for the style image.  This layer is then again decoded to an image.  The process continues until the affine transformed R11 layer is decoded to an image, which is retained.
% \begin{figure}[h]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{PlotsNCharts/UST_crossGram.pdf}
% \caption{\em Fast universal cross-layer transfer (FCT). We use similar procedure as in Li \ea \cite{UST}, a pair of convlutional features (e.g. R11 and R21) are reshaped and concatenated before performing transformation. The transformed feature is then split up and only one layer is fed into the decoder. We use off-shelf decoders from \cite{UST}.  }
% \label{fig:FCT_flow}
% \end{figure}

% This procedure is easily extended to cross-layer gram matrices (Figure~\ref{fig:FCT_flow}). We start by choosing sequence of sets of layer covariances to control.  The simple scheme is individual, controlling (R51), (R41), (R31), (R21), (R11). An alternative scheme is
% pairwise descending, where one controls (R51, R41); (R41, R31); (R31, R21); and (R21, R11).  Another scheme is descending, where one controls (R51, R41, R31, R21, R11); (R41, R31, R21, R11); (R31, R21, R11); etc. we then start the first set of relevant layers from the content image (i.e. (R51, R41) for pairwise; (R51, ... R11) for
% descending).  Construct a gram matrix from this {\em set} of layers, upsampling as required. 
% Apply an affine transformation to match the gram matrix of the corresponding {\em set} of layers for the
% style image, then decode the resulting layers to an image.  Pass this image through VGG, recover the next set of control
% layers from the result, apply an affine transformation to match the gram matrix of the corresponding {\em set} of layers for the
% style image, then decode the resulting layers to an image.  Proceed until the R11 layer is decoded to an image, and use
% that image.   Note that this approach controls both within layer and between layer statistics, as the relevant gram
% matrices have within layer gram matrices as diagonal blocks, and between layer gram matrices as off-diagonal blocks.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Symmetries and Stability}

Symmetries in a style transfer loss function occur when there is a transformation available that changes the style
transferred image without changing the value of the loss function.   Risser \ea note instability in Gatys' method;
symptoms are poor and good style transfers of the same style to the same content with about the same loss value~\cite{}.
They supply evidence that this behavior can be controlled by adding a histogram loss, which breaks the symmetry.
They do not write out the symmetry group as too complicated (~\cite{}, p*).  

In fact, the group is easy to construct.  
The supplementary materials give a construction where the symmetry fixes the gram matrix for a layer and its parent
(deeper networks follow the same lines).  It is necessary to assume the map from layer to layer is linear.  This is not
as restrictive as it may seem; the analysis yields a local construction about any generic operating point of the
network.  In summary, we have:

{\bf Symmetry group, within layer gram matrices, two layers:}
Assuming that the between layer map is affine, with matrix $\matx{M}$
representing the linear component.  With various assumptions about the 
spatial statistics of layer 1 (supplementary materials), the symmetry
group is obtained by:  choose $\vect{b}$ {\em not} of unit length, and
such that $\matx{M}\vect{b}=0$; now factor
$\matx{I}-\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{A}\matx{A}^T$; choose $\matx{U}$
orthonormal.  Then $(\vect{b}, \matx{A}\matx{U})$ is a symmetry of the
gram matrices in {\em both layers} (i.e the action of this element on
layer 1 fixes {\em both} gram matrices).

{\bf Symmetry group, between layer gram matrix, two layers:}
Assuming that the between layer map is affine, with matrix $\matx{M}$
representing the linear component.  With various assumptions about the 
spatial statistics of layer 1 (supplementary materials), the symmetry
group is obtained by:  choose $\matx{U}$
orthonormal.  Then $(\matx{U})$ is a symmetry of the between layer
gram matrix (i.e the action of this element on layer 1 fixes the
between layer gram matrix).


 The between-layer gram matrix loss has very different symmetries to Gatys'
(within-layer) method.  In particular, the symmetry of Gatys' method rescales
features while shifting the mean (because $\matx{A}$ can contain
strong rescalings with the right choice of $\vect{b}$).   For the
cross-layer loss, the symmetry cannot rescale, and cannot shift the
mean.   This implies that, if one constructs numerous style
transfers with the same style using Gatys' method, the variance of the layer features should be much greater than that
observed for the between layer method.  Furthermore, increasing style weights in Gatys method should result in poor
style transfers, by exaggerating the effects of the symmetry.  These theoretical predictions are confirmed by experiment (figure~\ref{}; and
section~\ref{ecplot}).

\end{figure}
\subsection{Experimental details}

We use VGG-19 for both style transfer and texture synthesis.  We use R11, R21, R31, R41, and R51 for style(texture) loss, and R42 for the content loss for style transfer. In loss optimization, if it not specified, all stylized images start from Gaussian noise image and optimized with LBFGS.

\subsection{Texture synthesis} 
Cross-layer gram matrix control applies to texture synthesis since style loss \cite{gatys2016image} was first introduced as "texture" loss in \cite{NIPS2015_5633}.  We now omit the content loss, and seeks a minimum of style loss alone.  We show texture synthesis results, which highlights the method's ability to manage long spatial correlations.  We controlled R51, R41, R31, R21, R11 for comparison with our style transfer results.  Our synthesis starts from an image which has the mean color of the texture image. %\textcolor{red}{Only 600 iterations is used in optimization, we just want to show their texture difference instead of to beat state of art.} 
As Figure \ref{fig:texture} shows, synthesized textures have better long scale coherence.    For the universal texture synthesis, we followed Li \ea  as starting from zero-mean Gaussian noise, run the multi level pipeline 3 times for better results.

%  Without the content loss and start with random initial image, the style transfer becomes texture synthesis. Because there is no restriction from content loss, the texture synthesis is a good way to compare the stylization ability of cross-layer gram matrix and within-layer gram matrix. Because our purpose is to compare the texture synthesis ability between within-layer gram matrix and cross-layer gram matrix, only R51,R41,R31,R21,R11 layers are considered as our style code; we do not try reproduce texture synthesis result of Gatys' by more layers.  To make the result better, our generated images start from a color shift as mean of texture image.  In Figure \ref{fig:texture}, we can see inter-layer results in column 3 and 4  having better texture construction than within-layer's in column 2; similarly our universal style transfer in column 6 has more organized structure than original universal style transfer in column 5. For universal texture synthesis, we follows Y. Li \ea's instruction by starting from a content with of Gaussian noise of zero mean and running the multi-level pipeline for a 3 times to get better result.

\subsection{Style transfer}\label{sec:mul}

{\bf Cross-layer vs. within-layer style loss:}  Figures~\ref{fig:cf1},~\ref{fig:cf2} compare style transfers using within-layer gram matrices
and cross-layer gram matrices with a pairwise descending strategy. Cross-layer gram matrices are particularly good at
preserving relations between effects, as the detail in figure~\ref{fig:cf2} shows.


{\bf Multiplicative loss:} The multiplicative loss often produces visual pleasing style transfer results by showing better style pattern arrangement at same time keeping the outline of content relatively intact, so that the generated image preserves the perceptual meaning of the content while showing coherent style patterns(Figure~\ref{fig:MulCG}); More examples are present in supplementary materials.  
%The Figure will illustrate more clear about the power of loss multiplication by comparing to results of loss addition with difference style weights.

(\cite{novak2016improving}, p5), which suggest ``tying distant ... layers produces poor results''.  

{\bf FCT vs WCT:}  Fast universal cross-layer transfer (FCT) works visually better than the original WCT method of Li \ea ~\cite{UST}, as Figure~\ref{fig:WCT1} shows.  However, FCT has some of the same difficulties that WCT has.  Both methods have
difficulty reproducing crisp subshapes in styles. 

{\bf Individual style loss control:} When one controls style loss using a single layer (or a single pair of layers). We can clearly see how they effect stylized images (Figure~\ref{fig:layer_wise}). We observe higher level style loss shows stronger control over long scale patterns from style images, this is in agreement with similar observations in \cite{gatys2016image}. We also found that cross-layer gram matrices have stronger ability in preserving prominent boundaries of content images while display equal or better control over long scale style patterns compared to the same level within-layer gram matrices.

{\bf Scales:}  A crop of the style image will effectively result in transferring larger style elements.  We expect that,
when style elements are large compared to the content, cross-layer methods will have a strong advantage because they
will be better able to preserve structural relations that make up style elements.   Qualitative evidence supports this
view (Figure~\ref{fig:scale2} and Figure~\ref{fig:scale3}).

%<<<<<<< HEAD
% Without the content loss and start with random initial image, the style transfer becomes texture synthesis. Because there is no restriction from content loss, the texture synthesis is a good way to compare the stylization ability of cross-layer gram matrix and within-layer gram matrix. Because our purpose is to compare the texture synthesis ability between within-layer gram matrix and cross-layer gram matrix, only R51,R41,R31,R21,R11 layers are considered as our style code; we do not try reproduce texture synthesis result of Gatys' by more layers.  To make the result better, our generated images start from a color shift as mean of texture image.  In Figure \ref{fig:texture}, we can see inter-layer results in column 3 and 4  having better texture construction than within-layer's in column 2; similarly our universal style transfer in column 6 has more organized structure than original universal style transfer in column 5. For universal texture synthesis, we follows Y. Li \ea's instruction by starting from a content with of Gaussian noise of zero mean and running the multi-level pipeline for a 3 times to get better result.

%To understand how it works, we do four sets of texture synthesis respectively with four pair of layers, i.e. R51 and R41, R41 and R31, R31 and R21, and R21 and R11.  For pair R51 and R41 as an example,  we use both R51 loss and R41 loss together as total within-layer texture loss so that we can compare its synthesis result with the result from Cross-layer texture loss of same pair layers. Our result shows that the Inter-layer texture synthesis usually has more profound structure than within-layer's at higher levels, e.g. pair R51 and R41 or Pair R41 and R31, otherwise we do not see the advantage of Inter-layer method. See Figure \ref{fig:texture1}.

%\section{Understanding the Loss multiplication}

%Too understand the result, we decided the generated image roughly by blocks and the pattern in each block determines the activation of R41 perceptual layer. 
%For multiplicative loss, the trivial optimal solution is the generated image equal to the content image, which is the case when stylization is failed. We consider this as golbal minimum. But what if the generated image can not reach this global minimum? It intuitively to guess it is trapped in a local minimum. Therefore, the next question is what is what are the possible solution to this local minimum. We can consider the result of the multiplicative loss as the first case, which looks like the whole image is roughly close gram matrix statistics but the detailed distribution is controlled by perceptual activation referenced to content image. It can be understand in this way. Because the image can not reach global minimum(zero content loss), due to the loss multiplication the value at each pixel has to be fine tunned so that it can minimize both content loss and style loss.  Moreover, as we know the gram matrix is a statistical constraint, which is relatively loose in local demand by comparing to content loss. Therefore, under the requirement of gram matrix statistics, the content loss still have enough degree to control exact pattern location to fit the required perceptual activation of layer R41 as the content, which is the result we get for case of loss multiplication.  

%How about another possible case in which part of image satisfies content and other part satisfies style, which mostly happens in optimization additive loss.  When we gradually increase the style weight, we can see the size decreasing of content blocks and size increasing to style  blocks. Why we did not see this in optimization on multiplicative loss? We can consider an case where the foreground is a person and background are trees, and foreground exactly kept as content but background styled. 
%For the loss additive case, as we know the the reception field increases with the level in VGG, even we know there is a perfect boundary as in this special case, the layer R41 feature map at boundary must contribute to both style loss and content loss. What we want to emphasis is that due to the overlap of receive fields of layer activations, the loss comes from boundary must exist. In case of additive loss, this loss contribution is the same order of magnitude as other blocks, but in multiplicative case there will be a cross term from multiplicative loss located at boundary having contribution much higher than others. Because of the huge contribution within this anomalous zoom, the optimizer has  to optimize it  in priority and therefore push the boundary, which is not case for additive loss. In loss multiplicative case, the results of pushing boundary will be either reaching global minimum or trapped in local minimum.

\subsection{Effectiveness and Coherence}\label{ecplot}

We use 50 styles and the 200 images from the BSD dataset.  Style transfer performance is strongly affected by choice of
weights.  Different style/image pairs require different choices of weight for the best performance.  This effect is not
normally taken into account in evaluation.  To allow a fair comparison between methods, we must evaluate at 
transfers obtained at multiple different weight values from a wide range of weights.  This means that simply computing
all transfers for all methods is impractical, and uninformative. 

Instead, we plot effectiveness against coherence to give an EC plot. Better methods will produce a feature layer
statistics closer to those of the desired style (i.e. larger $E$ values) for the same value of the coherence measure
(write $C$; we use both AUC and $L$).  In particular, because we need $\expect{E(C)}$, we can sample style/image/weight
triples at random, and still obtain an accurate estimate, as long as there are enough samples to keep the standard error
of the estimate low. 

{\bf Symmetry effects:} This plot is consistent with our symmetry analysis.  Gatys method cannot achieve high E values,
because symmetry in the style loss produces feature distributions that are quite different from that desired.
Furthermore, larger weights on the style loss {\em do not} produce better style transfers (large diamonds toward the
  bottom left of the plot).  Instead, by exaggerating the effect of the symmetry, large weights produce transfers that
  both have low E (poor transfer) {\em and} low C (do not respect original segmentation).  

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DAFFigures/l1xgcf.pdf}
\caption{An EC plot comparing style transfers using cross-layer loss with transfers using Gatys' loss.  Here the C
  statistic is per image AUC.  Point markers show individual image
  statistics (circles=cross layer,  diamonds=Gatys), with color keyed
  to the style and size keyed to the weight on the style loss (larger markers are larger
  weights, corresponding to a stronger weight being placed on style transfer).  Notice that some styles are clearly harder than others, and produce
  low E for both methods.  Notice also that Gatys method produces very
  weak results for high style weights (large diamonds toward the
  bottom left of the plot). The curves are Loess regression curves of E against C, with shadowed regions showing one
  standard error bars up and down.  For any value of C, there is strong evidence that cross-layer loss obtains on
  average a very much larger E than Gatys' loss (about three standard errors difference).  Note that cross-layer loss
  achieves an E comparable with simply resizing the style image; on
  average, E slightly less than 4. }
\label{ecxvg}
\end{figure*}
Figure~\ref{ecxvg} shows an EC plot of layer 1 comparing style transfers using the cross-layer loss with transfers using Gatys' loss.
Note that cross-layer loss achieves much higher average E for a given value of C; the effect is about three standard
errors in size, and so is clearly significant and cannot be ascribed to sampling error.

\begin{figure*}[!htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{DAFFigures/L1cont.pdf}
\caption{An EC plot comparing two control methods.  One reports the resized style image as the transfer (small diamonds,
  yellow curve) and the other reports the content image as the transfer (large dots, blue curve).  Colors are keyed to
  style.  There is significant variance in E for the resized style image, an effect due to resizing.  However, the range
  of E's shows the size of the effect of resizing on E; on average, E slightly greater than 4, only slightly larger
than that achieved by the cross-layer loss. The curves are Loess regression curves of E against C, with shadowed regions showing one
  standard error bars up and down. Scale is the same as Figure \protect \ref{ecxvg}.   }
\label{ecxvg}
\end{figure*}
{\bf Control:}  Figure~\ref{} shows an EC plot of two controls.  In the first, the resized style image is reported as a
transfer; this results as expected in high values of E, but low values of C.  In the second, the content image is
reported as a transfer; this results in low values of E, but high values of C (though not uniformly; some images remain
hard to segment).  


\section{Conclusion}
  
%\begin{itemize}
  

%Our experiment results suggest it shows several advantages over within layer gram matrix at preserve and transfer style patterns. 
%On the other hand, higher-layer feature maps usually characterize the geometry or other higher perceptual informations and lower-layer feature maps  usually control the coloring. Therefore, we expect to see the cross-layer gram matrices can do better both on preserving the style geometry and on the style coloring. We done the experiments and justify these points.  
 


%\textbf{Key message} : Cross-layer gram matrix can replace within-layer gram matrix with better style control under less degrees of constraint, and the loss-multiplication can successfully arrange the style patterns at right place to preserve the perceptual meaning as the content image. 
%\begin{itemize}
% \item the baseline comparison to Gatys shows Inter-gram matrix do better coloring to specific geometry and also preserving long scale behavior at same time.

 %\item the makeup transfer shows the Inter-gram matrix indeed has better style coordination and reconstruction.
 %\item the experiment of different scales can help to tell their differences from easy to hard styles. 
 %\item the texture synthesis is an easier to see their differences.
 %\item We also apply the Inter-gram matrices to Universal style transfer and justify the advantage of Inter-gram matrices in both style transfer and texture synthesis.
 %\item loss multiplication is really powerful for emphasizing the parts of different perceptual meaning in the content. Proper shifting the mean of Gaussian initial distribution may help to improve the chance of success in loss optimization. 
 %\item The loss multiplication can reduce their differences if we do multiplication between gram-matrix L2 losses of two different layers, which effectively works as an Inter-layer gram matrix.

\section*{Supplementary: Symmetries and Stability: Details}


The between-layer gram matrix loss has very different symmetries to the within-layer method.
This is most easily seen by writing out the group.  We will confine our analysis to two layers
(deeper networks follow the same lines).   Risser et al ascribe instability in Gatys' method to
symmetries in the Gram matrix, but do not write out the symmetry group as too complicated
(~\cite{}, p*).  In fact, the group is easy to construct with the right choice of coordinate system.
Various simplifications are required to understand the effects of a
second layer (details below).


This difference in symmetry groups is important.  Risser argues that
the symmetries of gram matrices in Gatys' method could lead to
unstable reconstructions; they control this effect using feature
histograms.  What causes the effect is that the symmetry rescales features while shifting the mean (eq *).  
For the cross-layer loss, the symmetry cannot rescale, and cannot shift the mean (eq *).  In turn, the instability
identified in that paper does not apply to the cross-layer gram matrix and our results could not be improved by adopting
a histogram loss.

Write $\vect{x}_{i}$, (resp $\vect{y}_i$ for the feature vector at the $i$'th location (of $N$ in total)
in the first (resp second) layer.  Write $\matx{X}^T=\left[\vect{x}_{1}, \ldots,
\vect{x}_{N}\right]$, etc.   

{\bf Symmetries of the first layer:} Now assume that the first layer has been normalized to zero mean and
unit covariance.  There is no loss of generality, because the whitening transform
can be written into the expression for the group. Write ${\cal
  G}(\matx{W})=(1/N)\matx{W}^T\matx{W}$ for the operator that forms
the within layer gram matrix. We have ${\cal G}(\matx{X})=\matx{I}$.   
Now consider an affine action on layer 1, mapping $\matx{X}_1$ to $\matx{X}_1^*=\matx{X}_1 \matx{A}+\vect{1}\vect{b}^T$; then for this to be a symmetry, we must have
$G(\matx{X}_1^*)= \matx{A}\matx{A}^T+\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{I}$.  In
turn, the symmetry group can be constructed by: choose $\vect{b}$
which does not have unit length; factor
$N(\matx{I}-\vect{b}\vect{b}^T)$ to obtain $\matx{A}(\vect{b})$ (for
example, by using a cholesky transformation); then any element of the
group is a pair $\left(\vect{b}, \matx{A}(\vect{b})\matx{U}\right)$
where $\matx{U}$ is orthonormal.  Note that factoring will fail for
$\vect{b}$ a unit vector, whence the restriction. 

{\bf The second layer:}   We will assume that the map between layers
of features is linear.  This assumption is not true in practice, but major
differences between symmetries observed under these conditions likely
result in differences when the map is linear.  We can analyze for two
cases: first, all units in the map observe only one input feature
vector (i.e. 1x1 convolutions; the {\em point sample} case); second, spatial homogeneity in the
layers.

{\bf The point sample case:} Assume that every unit in the map
observes only one input feature from the previous layer (1x1
convolutions).   We have $\matx{Y}=\matx{X}\matx{M}+\vect{1}\vect{n}^T$, because the map 
between layers is linear. Now consider the effect on the second layer.
We have ${\cal G}(\matx{Y})=\matx{M}\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}\vect{n}^T$.
Choose some symmetry group element for the first layer,
$\left(\vect{b}, \matx{A}\right)$.  The gram matrix for the second
layer becomes ${\cal G}(\matx{Y}^*)$, where
$\matx{Y}^*=(\matx{X} \matx{A}+\vect{1}\vect{b}^T)\matx{M}^T+\vect{1}\vect{n}^T.$
Recalling that $\matx{A}\matx{A}^T+\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{I}$ and
$\matx{X}^T\vect{1}=0$, we have 
\[
{\cal
  G}(\matx{Y}^*)=\matx{M}\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}\vect{n}^T+\vect{n}\vect{b}^T\matx{M}^T+\matx{M}\vect{b}\vect{n}^T
\]
so that ${\cal G}(\matx{X}_2^*)={\cal G}(\matx{X}_2)$ if
$\matx{M}\vect{b}=0$.  This is relatively easy to achieve with
$\vect{b}\neq 0$.

{\bf Spatial homegeneity:} Now assume the map between layers has
convolutions with maximum support $r \times r$.  Write $u$ for an
index that runs over the whole feature map, and $\psi(\vect{x}_u)$ for
a stacking operator that scans the convolutional support in fixed
order and stacks the resulting features. For example, given a 3x3
convolution and indexing in 2D, we might have
\[
\psi(\vect{x}_{22})=\left(\begin{array}{c}\vect{x}_{11}\\
\vect{x}_{12}\\
\ldots\\
\vect{x}_{33}
\end{array}\right)
\]

In this case, there is some $\matx{M}$, $\vect{n}$ so that 
$\vect{y}_u=\matx{M}\psi(\vect{x}_u)+\vect{n}$.  We ignore the
effects of edges to simplify notation (though this argument will go
through if edges are taken into account?).  Then there is some
$\matx{M}$, $\vect{n}$ so we can write 
\[
{\cal G}(\matx{Y})=(1/N) \sum_u
\matx{M}\psi(\vect{x}_u)\psi(\vect{x}_u)^T\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}\vect{n}^T
\]
Now assume further that
layer 1 has the following (quite restrictive) spatial homogeneity
property: for pairs of feature vectors within the layer $\vect{x}_{i,j}$, $\vect{x}_{i+\delta,
  j+\delta}$ with $\mid \! \delta\!\mid \leq r$ (ie within a convolution window of one
another), we have $\expect{\vect{x}_{i,j}\vect{x}_{i+\delta,
    j+\delta}}=\matx{I}$.  This assumption is consistent with image
autocorrelation functions (which fall off fairly slowly), but is still
strong. Write $\phi$ for an operator
that stacks $r \times r$ copies of its argument as appropriate, so
\[\phi(\matx{I})=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\matx{I}&\ldots&\matx{I}\\
\ldots &\ldots \ldots \\
\matx{I}&\ldots&\matx{I}
\end{array}\right).
\]
Then
$G(\matx{Y})=\matx{M}\phi(\matx{I})\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}\vect{n}^T$.
If there is some affine action on layer 1, we have
$G(\matx{Y}^*)=\matx{M}\left(\psi(\matx{A})\phi(\matx{I})\psi(\matx{A}^T)+\psi(\vect{b})\psi(\vect{b}^T)\right)\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}\vect{n}^T$,
where we have overloaded $\psi$ in the natural way.  Now if
$\matx{M}\psi(\vect{b})=0$ and $\matx{A}\matx{A}^T+\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{I}$, ${\cal
  G}(\matx{Y}^*)={\cal G}(\matx{Y})$. 



{\bf The cross-layer gram matrix:}  Symmetries of the cross-layer gram matrix are very different.  Write
${\cal G}(\matx{X}, \matx{Y})=(1/N) \matx{X}^T\matx{Y}$ for
the cross layer gram matrix.  

{\bf Cross-layer, point sample case:} Here (recalling $\matx{X}^T\vect{1}=0$)we have ${\cal G}(\matx{X},
\matx{Y})=\matx{M}^T$.    Now choose some symmetry group element for the first layer,
$\left(\matx{A}, \vect{b}\right)$.  The cross-layer gram matrix
becomes 
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal G}(\matx{X}^*, \matx{Y}^*)&=&(1/N) (\matx{A}
\matx{X}^T+\vect{b}\vect{1}^T)
\left[(\matx{X}
  \matx{A}^T+\vect{1}\vect{b}^T)\matx{M}^T+\vect{1}\vect{n}^T\right]\\
&=&\matx{M}^T+\vect{b}\vect{n}^T
\end{eqnarray*}
(recalling that $\matx{A}\matx{A}^T+\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{I}$ and
$\matx{X}^T\vect{1}=0$).  But this means that the symmetry requires
$\vect{b}=\vect{0}$; in turn, we must have $\matx{A}\matx{A}^T=\matx{I}$.


{\bf Cross-layer, homogeneous case:} We have
\[
{\cal G}(\matx{X}, \matx{Y})=(1/N)\sum_u \vect{x}_u\left[
  \psi(\vect{x}_u)^T\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}^T\right]=\matx{M}^T.\]
Now choose some symmetry group element for the first layer,
$\left(\matx{A}, \vect{b}\right)$.  The cross-layer gram matrix
becomes 
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal G}(\matx{X}^*, \matx{Y}^*)&=&(1/N)\sum_u \left(\matx{A} \vect{x}_u+\vect{b}\right)\left[\left(\psi(\vect{x}_u)^T\psi(\matx{A}^T)+\psi(\vect{b})\right)\matx{M}^T+\vect{n}^T\right]\\
&=&\matx{M}^T+\vect{b}\vect{n}^T
\end{eqnarray*}
(recalling the spatial homegeneity assumption, that $\matx{A}\matx{A}^T+\vect{b}\vect{b}^T=\matx{I}$ and
$\matx{X}_1^T\vect{1}=0$).  But this means that the symmetry requires
$\vect{b}=\vect{0}$; in turn, we must have
$\matx{A}\matx{A}^T=\matx{I}$.
