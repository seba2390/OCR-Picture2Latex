%Here we show the EC plots where KL divergence evaluated by layer 2,3,4 and 5.
Because there is good evidence that the distribution of features within lower feature layers of a CNN 
representation is an effective proxy to capture styles, see [28], we only show  first layer EC plot in our main content.

The rest EC plots are shown in follows.
Figure~\ref{mainweight2},\ref{mainweight3},\ref{mainweight4},\ref{mainweight5} shows EC plots (C as Pb AUC) for layer 2 to 5. the difference between different methods are less marked from layer 1 EC plot.
