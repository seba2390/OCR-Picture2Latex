\caption{\em An EC plot comparing two control methods.  One reports the resized style image as the transfer (small diamonds,
yellow curve) and the other reports the content image as the transfer (large dots, blue curve).  Colors are keyed to
style. The curves are Loess regression curves of E against C, with shadowed regions showing one standard error bars. Scale is the same as Figure \protect \ref{ecxvg}.     }
