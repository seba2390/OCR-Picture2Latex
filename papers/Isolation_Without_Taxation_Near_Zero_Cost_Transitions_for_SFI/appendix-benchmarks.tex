    Performance of the \trlucet heavyweight transitions included in the Lucet runtime
    on the image benchmarks in \sectionref{sec:eval}. Performance
    when rendering (a)~a simple image with one color, (b)~a stock image and
    (c)~a complex image with random pixels. The performance is the overhead
    compared to \trfast.

	Performance of an ideal isolation scheme (no enforcement overhead) with heavy trampolines when rendering images. Wasm compilers whose enforcement overhead is lower than this can outperform even an ideal isolation scheme that uses heavy weight transitions.
