\section{Summary and discussion}\label{s:disc}

In this work we introduced an attack that allows an adversary to violate the 
  guarantees of MPM systems by leveraging users' friends.
We also proposed several mitigations, but our proposals satisfy only two out 
  of three desirable properties: privacy (leak no information), low 
  communication overhead (i.e., clients need not send many messages per round), 
  and low latency (friends get to talk to each other often).
The most pragmatic of our solutions requires bounding the maximum number of 
  friends that a client can have.

Even with our mitigations, compromised friends are a liability and can be
  used to learn sensitive information through other means.
For example, if a user is uncharacteristically slow to respond to a 
  compromised friend's message (a user's response pattern could be constructed over
  many prior interactions), this anomaly in itself leaks information.
We believe that understanding the impact of this type of attack in
  practice is a promising avenue for future work.
