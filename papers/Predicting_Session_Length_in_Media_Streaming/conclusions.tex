% What we did
In this paper we perform the first, to the best of our knowledge, analysis of session
length in a mobile-focused online service.
Our analysis showed that the probability of a session to end evolves differently
for different users, with some exhibiting ``negative aging`` and others
``positive aging''.
We also used a state of the art prediction algorithm to predict the length
of a session based on user-level and contextual features, and demonstrated the differences
between using a root mean squared error objective function and a Gamma regression
objective that is more suited to right-skewed, non-negative data such as session length.

% Future work

In the future we aim to demonstrate the utility of session length prediction,
by using the predictions made by our model as input to a recommender system,
or an ad scheduling algorithm.
We also plan to improve our predictive models by incorporating features
whose values evolve during a session (like interactions with the application), and keep a running
estimate for the duration of a session as it evolves.
