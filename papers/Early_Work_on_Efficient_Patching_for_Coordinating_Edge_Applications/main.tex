%Autonomous Driving vehicles are evolving at a very fast pace. Service hand-off through application migration is a crucial research area in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present Chimera Engine and cloudlet which aid in balancing the trade-off between migration time, accuracy, storage and energy requirements while running a Machine Learning application. Our proposed solution is capable of dynamically adapting to field data with Machine Learning models that sufficiently meet the autonomy criteria. This work is important when 1. Multiple applications need to be context switched using an edge device 2. Handling multiple autonomous systems (called swarms) that are coordinating and directing towards a common goal.
