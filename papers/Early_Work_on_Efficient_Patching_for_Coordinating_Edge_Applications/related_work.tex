\section{Related Work}
To the best of our knowledge, so far no approaches with focus of this paper (Efficient Patching for coordinating Edge Applications) have been published. In this section, we discuss related work which are closely related to the research problem of this paper. Lele Ma et al.~\cite{service_handoff} proposed efficient service hand-off across edge servers using Docker containers migration. Researchers give an in-depth explanation of leveraging Docker features to the full extent. The paper incorporates migration algorithm for service hand-off which gives insights on the process of patching an application. Taherizadeh et al.~\cite{dml_scaling} proposed an auto-scaling method for time-critical cloud applications considering system performance and application level monitoring. The researchers built a Dynamic Multi-level autoscaling system using Kubernetes as an orchestrator. Kaewkasi et al.~\cite{7886112} worked on building Ant colony optimization based scheduling algorithm which outperforms the built-in scheduling provided by Docker Swarm. This research gave hints on carefully considering resource utilization and available resources for coordinating applications.
