% This is from what Naveen has understood and thought about in mind.
\textbf{Pre-conditions:} A Docker containerized Application which uses field data and ML model for decision making. "Chimera Engine" which continuously tracks Application and make sure Autonomy criteria is satisfied. "Cloudlet" segregates and fragments the application components. It computes efficient model to be chosen.

AC = Autonomy Criteria, like Energy, Accuracy, latency and storage.
ACC = Accuracy
E = Energy
S = Storage
L = Latency

At the source/edge computer: while (AC ! satisfied)
{
1.Chimera Engine tracks the new AC requirements
2.Cloudlet uses Best Model Chooser Algorithm to find 3-5 best models and dumps them to a priority\_queue.
3. Only diff of updated model and original model is tracked by Chimera Engine. This is sent back to edge computer and model is updated.
