\section{Coalescer and Stratagem Functionality}

 %The Coalescer component, consisting of manager nodes, has three main functionalities:

%\begin{enumerate}
%   \item Track the changes in applications and report them to Strategem.
%    \item It handles the migration of model or data from Stratagem to Application or vice-versa.
%    \item It also makes sure that system specified autonomy criteria is being satisfied. It aggregates each application's performance and aggregated them to make sure overall system specified performance criteria is being satisfied.
%\end{enumerate}
%The Strategem component, consisting of worker nodes, has three main functionalities:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Record the per-application contents and update further changes to the application.
%    \item Maintain a list of best models. Newer models can be generated based on updates to autonomy criteria. A newer model of less size, greater accuracy, lesser energy can be generated and later used by the application.
%    \item Whenever the current model 'm\_curr' need to be updated with a better model 'm\_betr', the diff of m\_curr and m\_betr would be transferred from Stratagem to Application with the help of Coalescer.
%\end{enumerate}
