The main limitation of generalized PTR is that one needs to ``propose'' a good guess of parameter $\phi$.  Take the example of $\phi$ being the noise level in a noise-adding mechanism. Choosing too small a $\phi$ will result in a useless output $\perp$, while choosing too large a $\phi$ will add more noise than necessary. Finding this 'Goldilocks' $\phi$ might require trying out many different possibilities -- each of which will consume privacy budget.

% Calculating the data-dependent DP offers a systematic way to find this 'Goldilocks' $\phi$.
