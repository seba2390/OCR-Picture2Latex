In this work, we propose \ours{}, which learns the latent representation to approximate the execution of partial programs, even if their semantics are not well-defined. We demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing elementary C code from input-output examples only, and leveraging learned execution significantly improves the prediction performance by around $20\%$. Meanwhile, compared to the randomly generated programs, \ours{} synthesizes more concise programs that resemble human-written code, and training on these synthesized programs further improves the prediction performance for both Karel and C program synthesis. Our results indicate the promise of leveraging the learned program synthesizer to improve the dataset quality for programming by example tasks.

We consider extending our approach to synthesize more complicated real-world code as future work. For example, we will integrate our latent executor into large-scale pre-trained language models, which could further improve the performance of those program synthesis models taking natural language specifications. We will also study program synthesis problems with unbounded input ranges and different type signatures, which could be approached with the usage of subword tokenizers.
