\subsubsection*{A converse example}
Consider a noiseless CS recovery problem where $n =2$, $m=1$ and the sampling matrix (i.e. here a row vector) is
\eq{A=[\cos(\gamma)\quad -\sin(\gamma)]}
for some parameter $0\leq\gamma<\pi/2$. Consider the following one-dimensional signal model along the first coordinate:
\eq{
\Cc = \{x\in \RR^2: x(1)\in \RR,\, x(2)=0\}.
}
We have indeed $\vertiii{A}=1$. It is easy to verify that both of the embedding constants w.r.t. to $\Cc$ are
\eq{ \mmx=\MM = \cos(\gamma)^2.}
Therefore one can tune $\gamma\rightarrow \pi/2$ to obtain arbitrary small ratios for $\sqrt{\frac{\mmx}{\vertiii{A}}}=\cos(\gamma)$. 
%$\vertiii{A}$ and $\mmx$ the 

Assume the true signal, the corresponding CS measurement,  and the initialization point are
\eq{
x^\gt=[1 \quad 0]^T,\quad y=Ax^\gt=\cos(\gamma) \qandq x^0=[0 \quad 0]^T.
}
%and the initialization point $x^0=(0,0)^T$. 
Consider an adversarial $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate projection oracle which performs the following step for any given $x\in \RR^2$:
\eq{
		\pp_\Cc^{\epsilon}(x) := [x(1)+\epsilon x(2) \quad 0]^T.
	}
For simplicity we assume no errors on the gradient step. 	
By setting $\mu=1/\cos(\gamma)^2$, the corresponding inexact IPG updates as 
\eq{	
	x^k(1)= 1+\epsilon\tan(\gamma) \left(x^{k-1}(1)-1\right)  
}
and only along the first dimension (we note that due to the choice of oracle $x^k(2)=0, \forall k$). Therefore we have
\eq{	
	x^k(1)= 1-\left(\epsilon\tan(\gamma)\right)^k.
}
which requires $\epsilon<\tan^{-1}(\gamma)=O(\cos(\gamma))$ for convergence, and it diverges otherwise. As we can see for $\gamma\rightarrow \pi/2$  (i.e. where $A$ becomes extremely unstable w.r.t. sampling the first dimension) the range of admissible $\epsilon$ shrinks, regardless of the fact that the restricted embedding $\mmx=\MM$ exhibits a  perfect isometry; which is an ideal situation for solving a noiseless CS (i.e. in this case an exact IPG takes only one iteration to converge).
