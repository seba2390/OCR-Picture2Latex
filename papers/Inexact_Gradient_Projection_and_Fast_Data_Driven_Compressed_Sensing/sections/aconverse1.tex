\subsubsection*{A converse example}
Consider a noiseless CS recovery problem where $n =2$, $m=1$ and the sampling matrix (i.e. here a row vector) is 
$A=[1\quad a]$ 
for some parameter $a\in \RR$. Consider the following one-dimensional signal model along the first coordinate:
\eq{
\Cc = \{x\in \RR^2: x(1)\in \RR,\, x(2)=0\}.
}
We have indeed $\vertiii{A}=\sqrt{1+a^2}$. It is easy to verify that both of the embedding constants w.r.t. to $\Cc$ are
\eq{ \mmx=\MM = 1.}
Therefore one can tune $a\rightarrow \infty$ to obtain arbitrary small ratios for $\sqrt{\frac{\mmx}{\vertiii{A}}}={(1+a^2)^{-1/4}}$. 
%$\vertiii{A}$ and $\mmx$ the 

Assume the true signal, the corresponding CS measurement,  and the initialization point are
\eq{
x^\gt=[1 \quad 0]^T,\quad y=Ax^\gt=1 \qandq x^0=[0 \quad 0]^T.
}
%and the initialization point $x^0=(0,0)^T$. 
Consider an adversarial $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate projection oracle which performs the following step for any given $x\in \RR^2$: \marginpar{\todo{verify + this part modified $\epsilon$}}
\eq{
		\pp_\Cc^{\epsilon}(x) := [x(1)+\epsilon x(2) \quad 0]^T.
	}
For simplicity we assume no errors on the gradient step. 	
By setting $\mu=1/\beta=1$, the corresponding inexact IPG updates as 
\eq{	
	x^k(1)= 1+\epsilon a \left(1-x^{k-1}(1)\right)  
}
and only along the first dimension (we note that due to the choice of oracle $x^k(2)=0, \forall k$). Therefore we have
\eq{	
	x^k(1)= 1-\left(-\epsilon a\right)^k.
}
which requires $\epsilon<a^{-1}$ for convergence, and it diverges otherwise. As we can see for $a\rightarrow \infty$  %(i.e. where $A$ becomes extremely unstable w.r.t. sampling the first dimension)
i.e. small ratio $\sqrt{\frac{\mmx}{\vertiii{A}}}$, 
the range of admissible $\epsilon$ shrinks, regardless of the fact that the restricted embedding $\mmx=\MM$ exhibits a  perfect isometry; which is an ideal situation for solving CS (i.e. in this case an exact IPG takes only one iteration to converge).
