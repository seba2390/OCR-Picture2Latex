In recent years, there has been a growing demand for cloud-based multimedia multicasting services with the growing advancements in wireless communications on mobile devices. Because of the resource limitations of mobile devices, employment of approaches for efficient utilization of these services is substantial. In this survey, we discussed the state of the art approaches for multicasting of video-on-demand applications on mobile devices. We introduced three state of the art approaches for efficiently multicasting cloud video contents to mobile devices that can cover a wide range of applications such as in cloud game streaming without violating the limited scope of this survey.
