\section{Ethical Considerations}
We discussed our project and experiments with our institutionsâ€™ IRB office and they determined that no IRB review nor IRB approval is required. Moreover, the house and WiFi devices used in most experiments are owned and controlled by the authors. Finally, in order to expedite mitigating the attacks presented in this paper, we have started engagements with WiFi access point and chipset manufacturers. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we identify two loopholes in the WiFi protocol and demonstrate their possible privacy and security threats. In particular, we reveal that today's WiFi radio responds to packets from unauthorized devices outside of the network and it can be easily manipulated to keep awake. These loopholes can be exploited by malicious attackers to jeopardize our daily use of WiFi devices. As examples, we demonstrate how an attacker can take advantage of these loopholes to extract private information such as breathing rate and quickly exhaust the battery of a typical IoT device, leaving the victim's device in a disabled state.
