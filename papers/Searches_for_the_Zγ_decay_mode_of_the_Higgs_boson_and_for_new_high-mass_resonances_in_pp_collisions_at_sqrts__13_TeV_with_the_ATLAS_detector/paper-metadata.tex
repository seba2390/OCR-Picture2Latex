\AtlasAbstract{%

This article presents searches for the \Zg decay of the Higgs boson and for narrow
high-mass resonances 
decaying to $Z\gamma$, exploiting $Z$ boson decays to pairs of electrons or muons.
The data analysis uses \lumithirteentev~\invfb~of $pp$ collisions at \sqtt~recorded
by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data are found to be
consistent with the expected Standard Model background. 
The observed (expected -- assuming Standard Model $pp\to H\to Z\gamma$ production and decay) 
upper limit on the production cross section times the branching ratio for $pp\to H\to Z\gamma$ is 
 \mhObserved~(\mhExpectedSMHiggs) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95\% 
confidence level for a
Higgs boson mass of 125.09~\GeV. In addition, upper limits are set on the production
cross section times the branching ratio as a function of the mass of a narrow resonance between 
 250~\GeV\ and 2.4~\TeV, assuming spin-0 resonances produced via gluon--gluon fusion, 
and spin-2 resonances produced via gluon--gluon or quark--antiquark initial states. For high-mass spin-0 resonances, 
the observed (expected) limits vary between \highmasslimitlowmX~(\highmasslimitlowmXexp) 
and \highmasslimithighmX~(\highmasslimithighmXexp) for 
the mass range from 250~\GeV\ to 2.4~\TeV\
at the 95\% confidence level.
