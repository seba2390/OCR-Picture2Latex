Searches for \Zg decays of the SM Higgs boson (\htoZg) and of a narrow high-mass resonance (\xtoZg) in 
\lumithirteentev~\invfb of $pp$ collisions at \sqtt~at 
the LHC have been performed with the ATLAS experiment.
The observed data are consistent with the
expected background. No evidence for the \htoZg~and \xtoZg~decays is observed and upper limits
 are set on \sighbr~at $\mH =125.09$~\GeV\ and also on \sigxbr~as a function of $m_X$. 
For the Higgs mass of 125.09~\GeV, the observed 95\% CL upper
limit on the \sighbr~is \mhObserved~times the SM prediction.
The search for high-mass $Z\gamma$
resonances was studied using both the spin-0 and spin-2 interpretations.
The observed limit varies between \highmasslimitlowmX\
and \highmasslimithighmX\ for the mass range from 250~\GeV\ to 2.4~\TeV\
for a spin-0 resonance, where a resonance produced in gluon--gluon fusion is used
as a benchmark model. 
For spin-2 resonances, LO predictions from the Higgs Characterisation Model are used as
benchmarks. The limits for spin-2 resonances range
between \highmasslowlimitgg~(\highmasslowlimitqq)
and \highmasshighlimitgg~(\highmasshighlimitqq) for the the mass range from 250~\GeV\ to 2.4~\TeV\ for a
resonance produced via gluon--gluon (quark--antiquark) initial states. 
The corresponding expected limits for this mass range vary between \highmasslimitlowmXexp\
and \highmasslimithighmXexp\ for a spin-0 resonance, and 
between \highmasslowlimitggexp~(\highmasslowlimitqqexp)
and \highmasshighlimitggexp~(\highmasshighlimitqqexp) for a spin-2
resonance produced via gluon--gluon (quark--antiquark) initial states.
