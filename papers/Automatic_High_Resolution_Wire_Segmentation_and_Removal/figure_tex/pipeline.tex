\caption{\textbf{Our wire removal system}. A system overview of our wire segmentation and removal for high resolution images. Input is concatenated with min- and max-filtered luminance channels. The downsampled input is fed into the coarse module to obtain the global probability. In the local stage, original-resolution patches are concatenated with the global probability map to obtain the local logit map. After a segmentation mask is predicted, we adopt LaMa architecture and use a tile-based approach to achieve wire removal. See Section~\ref{sec:segmentation},~\ref{sec:inpainting} for details.}
