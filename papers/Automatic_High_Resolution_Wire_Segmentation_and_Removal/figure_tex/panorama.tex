\caption{\textbf{Segmentation result for a panoramic image.} Our two-stage model leverages the sparsity of wires in natural images, and efficiently generalizes to ultra-high resolution images such as this panorama of $10$K by $2$K resolution. Note that our method produces high quality wire segmentation that covers wires that are almost invisible.}
