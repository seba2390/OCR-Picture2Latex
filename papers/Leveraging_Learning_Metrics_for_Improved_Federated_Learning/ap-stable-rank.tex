\chapter{Utilizing Stable Rank in a Federated Setting}
Regarding Future Work in \autoref{sec:future-work}, initial investigations into leveraging stable rank into the federated setting has been conducted for Adam without StepLR.

As seen in \autoref{fig:fedsr-adam-nosteplr}, the test-accuracy is competitive using stable-rank, and should warrant further investigation.
