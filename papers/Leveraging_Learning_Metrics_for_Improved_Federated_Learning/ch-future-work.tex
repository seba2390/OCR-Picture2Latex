\chapter{Future Work}
The next phases are clear for the progression of this work. Firstly, the need to better understand \texttt{Flower}, since the communication framework is complex, is paramount. As this work relies on \texttt{Flower}, this can be completed within a few weeks by re-implementing Federated Averaging \cite{konevcny2016federated}. \\

Secondly, building on this work, the implementation of the quality \& explainability metrics into the work must be done. This is the crux of the research, where the explainability of the client networks, layer-by-layer are evaluated and transmitted, allowing the central server to adjust parameters according to learnings. In this way the expected value of the empirical risk minimization $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{D}_k}[F_k(w)] = f(w)$ can be shown to still work in a theoretical bound. \\

Finally, integrating \& testing with existing methods such as precision, unbiased gradient accumulation (UGA) and proximal learning would allow this work to build on the state-of-the-art methods.
