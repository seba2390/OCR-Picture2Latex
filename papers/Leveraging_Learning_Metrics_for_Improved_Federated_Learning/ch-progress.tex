\chapter{Progress  To Date}
The first semester was spent mainly setting up the problem statement \& exploring the variety of explainable metrics that can arise. Both Federated Learning \& the explainable AI spaces are extremely vast, and truly understanding the field required time. \\

In recent weeks, the research has progressed significantly, where building the Residual Networks for testing has taken place \& preliminary testing in a federated setting has taken place using \texttt{Flower} \cite{beutel2020flower}, a Federated Learning Framework. \\

The beginnings of the mathematical proof for convergence using explainable metrics has been started as well, allowing theoretical convergence properties to be explored. With the literature review, the precision \& proximal learning can now be included as additional corollaries.
