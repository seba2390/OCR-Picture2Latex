\section{\system Warning to User}
\label{app:phoenix_warning_to_user}
In this section we provide screenshots of the \system app and the warnings
provided to the user.

\subsection{\system screenshots}
In this subsection we present two screenshots of the \system application.
In Figure \ref{fig:phoenix_app_screenshots}(a), \system is running but no attack
has occurred. In Figure \ref{fig:phoenix_app_screenshots}(b), \system is running
when the Numb attack was performed and the attack was detected.

When \system detects the Numb Attack, it provides a possible remedy which is
to re-insert the SIM card or completely reboot the device. Additionally,
it provides a description of the implication of this attack.
