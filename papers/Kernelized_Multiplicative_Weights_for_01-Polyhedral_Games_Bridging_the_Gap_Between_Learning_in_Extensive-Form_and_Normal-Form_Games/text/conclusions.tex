\section{Conclusions}

We introduce the Kernelized OMWU algorithm for simulating OMWU on the vertices of a 0/1-polyhedral set.
KOMWU can be implemented via black-box access to kernel evaluations, and these evaluations can be performed in linear time for EFGs.
This leads to new state-of-the-art regret bounds and other properties for no-regret learning on EFGs that were previously only obtained for NFGs.
In the appendix, we show that KOMWU can be implemented efficiently for several other domains:
$n$-sets, which are  0/1-polydral sets of the form $\vpi \in \{0,1\}^d: \|\vpi\|_1 = n$,
the unit hypercube, flows in directed acyclic graphs, permutations, and Cartesian products of sets with efficient kernel evaluations.
For $n$-sets we obtain an improved cost-per-iteration compared to existing methods for simulating OMWU.
