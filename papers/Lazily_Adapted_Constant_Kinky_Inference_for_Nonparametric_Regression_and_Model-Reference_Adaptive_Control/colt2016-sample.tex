\section{Introduction}

This is where the content of your paper goes.  Remember to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Include, within the first 12 or less pages, a concise and clear statement and discussion of the paper's contributions. %Limit the main text (without bibliography and appendices) to 12 pages.
\item Include, either in the main text or the appendices, all proofs
  and derivations required to substantiate the results.
\item Do not include author names (this is done automatically by inclusion of ``anon" option in documentclass), and to
  the extent possible, avoid directly identifying the authors.  You
  should still include all relevant references, including your own,
  and any other relevant discussion, even if this might allow a
  reviewer to infer the author identities.
\item Avoid modifying the default margins, spacing and fonts (either manually or via packages such as fullpage).
\end{itemize}
