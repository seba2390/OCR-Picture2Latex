\section{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:OiIsI-Part-SIR}}\label{app_lmm3}
\begin{proof}
    First, note that $\cO_i$ is IR as $\ir(\cA)$ is IR, and pruning the query tree does not increase label complexity.
    For any $i\in [k]$, suppose that there exists an hypothesis $h\in \hat H$ s.t. $\abs{H(X_i|h)} < \abs{H(X_i)}$.
    Then in the query tree of $\cA(\pi, \{X_i\})$, either all leaves are inconsistent with $h(X_{-i})$ or there exists one internal node $v$ who has exactly one subtree with all leaves inconsistent with $h(X_{-i})$.
    This node $v$ as well as the corresponding subtree are pruned in $\cO_i$ and thus the leaves in the other subtree rooted at $v$  have their depth reduced by at least $1$. Now, there exists an hypothesis $h''\in \hat H$ such that $h''(X_i)\in H(X_i|h)$ and $h''(X_i)$ is in the other subtree.
    Since $h''(X_{-i}) = h(X_{-i})$, when the underlying hypothesis is $h''$, the pruned tree given $h''(X_{-i})$ is the same as that given $ h(X_{-i})$. Hence, we have $Q_i(\cO_i,\pi,\xset, h'') \leq Q_i(\cA,\pi,\xset,h'')-1$.
    
    Then we have 
    \begin{align*}
        &Q_i(\cO_i,\pi,\xset) =  \EEs{h\sim \pi}{Q_i(\cO_i,\pi,\xset, h)}
        \\
        =& \pi(h'')Q_i(\cO_i,\pi,\xset, h'') + (1-\pi(h''))\EEs{h\sim \pi|h \neq h''}{Q_i(\cO_i,\pi,\xset, h)}\\
        \leq & \pi(h'')(Q_i(\cA,\pi,\xset, h'')-1) + (1-\pi(h''))\EEs{h\sim \pi|h\neq h''}{Q_i(\cA,\pi,\xset, h)}\\
        <& Q_i(\cA,\pi,\xset)\,,
    \end{align*}
where the last inequality holds due to $\pi(h'')>0$ since  w.l.o.g., we assumed $\pi(h)>0$ for all $h\in \hat H$ in Section~\ref{sec:model}.
\end{proof}
