\section{Proof of necessity of Assumption~\ref{asp:clb-help}}\label{app:nece-asp}
\begin{proof}[Proof of necessity]
Suppose that there exists an SIR algorithm $\cA''$ when the baseline algorithm is optimal. We therefore have 
$Q_i(\cA'',\pi,\xset) < Q^*(\pi,\{X_i\})$ by definition.  
We claim that $\cA''$ must satisfy $Q_i(\cA'',\pi,\xset) \geq \EEs{h\sim \pi}{Q^*(\pi_{h,-i}, \{X_i\})}$.
This is because we can construct another algorithm $\cB$ by running $\cA''$ over all other agents except agent $i$, i.e., running $\cA''$ over $(\pi, X_{-i})$ with $X_{-i}= \{X_j|j\neq i\}$ first to recover the labels of all other agents $X_{-i}$.
Then, $\cB$ simulates $\cA''$ over $(\pi, \xset)$ without actually querying any point in $X_{-i}$ (similarly to Algorithm~\ref{alg:basic2ir}).
In this case, the label complexities of agent $i$ are identical for algorithms $\cB$ and $\cA''$, i.e., $Q_i(\cB,\pi,\xset)= Q_i(\cA'',\pi,\xset)$. 
Since $Q^*(\pi_{h,-i}, \{X_i\})$ is the optimal label complexity of agent $i$ given the label information of $X_{-i}$, we have $Q_i(\cB,\pi,\xset) \geq Q^*(\pi_{h,-i}, \{X_i\})$.
Therefore, we have $Q^*(\pi,\{X_i\}) > Q_i(\cA'',\pi,\xset)\geq Q^*(\pi_{h,-i}, \{X_i\})$.
\end{proof}
