\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we propose an index-based policy for finite horizon RMAB that is computational tractable, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in the same limit as considered by Whittle. We also show that the numerical performance of this index-based policy beats the state-of-art. For future work, we conjecture that our results, including the formulation of the policy and the asymptotic optimality, can be extended to the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple actions associated with a state, instead of an  active and a passive action in the current formulation;
\item A total budget constraint over the entire time horizon, in addition to budget constraint at every time step.
\item Infinite state space.
\end{enumerate}
