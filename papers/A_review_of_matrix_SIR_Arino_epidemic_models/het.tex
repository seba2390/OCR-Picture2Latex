\section{$S^{(m)}YR$ models with $m$ groups of susceptibles \la{s:het}}
The SIR-compartment model  makes the unrealistic assumption that the population through which the disease is spreading is well-mixed.
However, differences in susceptibility and rates of contact between individuals strongly affect their likelihood of catching COVID-19. A model which attempts to capture this  aspect is:
\be{syrW}
\begin{aligned}
\bc
& \s_k'(t)= -  \s_k(t)\; \vi (t)  \bb_k, \; \; k=1,...,m \\
&  \vi'(t)=   \sum_{k=1}^m   \s_k(t) \; \vi(t)  \bb_k \;  \va -\vi(t) V \\
&\vec \r'(t) =  \vi(t) W
\ec
\end{aligned}
\ee

\beL
A disease free equilibrium $(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m, \vec 0, \vec r_0)$ of \eqref{syrW}
is asymptotically stable iff $s \mR <1,$ where $s = \sum_k s_k$ and
 \be{R0mat}
 \mR =  \sum_k \frac{s_k}{s} \;  \va\; V^{-1} \bb_k=  \sum_k \frac{s_k}{s} \;  \mR_k, \quad \mR_k:=\va\; V^{-1} \bb_k\ee
 is the spectral radius of the next generation matrix.
\eeL

While the final size may also be obtained under this model \cite[Thm. 2.1]{Andr}, for transient behavior
it is convenient  to turn to a simpler model.

\ssec{A generalization of heterogeneous SEIR \cite{Dolb}}

  Assume now that $\bb_k =\b_k \bb,$ where $\b_k \in \R_+$ and W=$\bb \vec w$,
  where $\vec w$ is a row vector. Putting  $\y=\vi \bb$,
the  system \eqr{syrW} becomes:\fn[4]{Such a dynamics was first considered in \cite{Gart}.}
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \log\s_k}{dt} = - \beta_k\,\y\,,\quad
\frac{d\vi}{dt}= \(\,\sum_{k=1}^m\beta_k\,\s_k\)\y \va -  \vi\,V,\quad
%\frac{d\i}{dt}=\g_e\,\e-\,\gamma\,\y\,,\quad
\frac{d\vr}{dt}=\vi W=\y \vec w,
\label{syr2}
\end{equation}
and \be{I}{\vr(t)}=\int_0^t \y(u)du \; \vec w:=I(t) \; \vec w.\ee

It is convenient to reparametrize the model taking $I$ as parameter, or, equivalently, by taking
   \be{gam}\r =\vr \bff 1=\g I, \g:= \vec w \bff 1.\ee

   Solving $$\frac d{dt}\(\log\s_k\)=-\,\beta_k\,\y=-\,\frac{\beta_k}\gamma\,\frac d{dt}\r\, ,$$
 we find that the system has a family of first integrals which includes
\be{seir2:conservation}
 \bc \fr{1}{\mR_1} \log(s_1/s_1(0))=...= \fr{1}{\mR_k} \log(s_k/s_k(0))=...= \fr{1}{\mR_m} \log(s_m/s_m(0))=r(0) -r,\\
\sum_{k=1}^m s_k+\sum_{k=1}^n y_k + \sum_{k=1}^p r_k=1\ec.
\ee

Also
\be{s_k(t)}
\s_k(t)=\s_k(0)\,e^{-{\beta_k\,I(t)}}=\s_k(0)\,e^{-{\fr{\beta_k}\g\,\r(t)}},
%\quad\mbox{with}
%\quad\s_k(0)=\s_k(0)\,e^\frac{\beta_k\,\r(0)}\gamma,\;
%\s_k(0)=p_k\,\s(0).
\ee
where $\g$ is defined in \eqr{gam}.
