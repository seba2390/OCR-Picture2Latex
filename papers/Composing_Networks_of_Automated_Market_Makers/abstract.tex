Automated market makers (AMMs) are automata that trade electronic assets at rates set by mathematical formulas. AMMs are usually implemented by smart contracts on blockchains.
In practice,
AMMs are often \emph{composed}:
trades can be split across AMMs,
and outputs from one AMM can be directed to another.
This paper proposes a mathematical model for AMM composition.
We define sequential and parallel composition operators for AMMs
in a way that ensures that AMMs are closed under composition,
in a way that works for ``higher-dimensional'' AMMs that
manage more than two asset classes, and so the composition
of AMMs in ``stable'' states remains stable.
