Modern AMMs provide increasingly complex rules for trades.
For example, Uniswap v3~\cite{uniswapv3} allows liquidity providers to
choose to take trades only over finite ranges.
In the future,
we would like to understand how to define composition operators
for varieties of range-restricted AMMs,
but we hope the reader is convinced that understanding composition
of simple AMMs is already challenging,
and an important step to understand more general cases.

AMMs are increasingly being integrated with external price
information oracles.
For example,
Krishnamachari \emph{et al.}~\cite{krishnamachari2021dynamic}
describe a family of AMMs capable of adjusting their
curves in response to reported price changes.
In future work,
we plan to investigate composition for AMMs that make use of oracle services..

The work presented here is a first step toward analyzing
decentralized finance from a distributed computing perspective.
In future work,
we hope to consider more complex networks of AMMs,
the challenges of cross-chain AMMs,
synchronization problems such as front-running,
as well as more adaptive AMM structures.
