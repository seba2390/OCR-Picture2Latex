\section{Conclusion}

Utilizing distortion measures has so far been time-consuming due to the lack of a well-established implementation.
To address this issue, we present \library, a Python library that allows easy and scalable execution of distortion measures. 
We believe that \library will mitigate the challenges associated with the evaluation of DR embeddings, promoting the design and development of visual analytics applications for high-dimensional data. 

We plan to extend our library into JavaScript, making it compatible with a wider range of existing visualizations \cite{bostock11tvcg} and DR \cite{cutura20vis} toolboxes. Investigating how each distortion measure operates in more detail will also be an interesting direction. We would also like to provide guidelines for utilizing distortion measures.
