In this work we tackle the problem of video object segmentation and explore the utility of object re-identification. 
We propose Video Object Segmentation with Re-identification (VS-ReID) model which includes two dedicated modules: a mask propagation module and a ReID module.
It is observed that our ReID module combined with bidirectional refinement is capable of retrieving missing instances and greatly improves the performance.
These two modules are employed iteratively, enabling our final model to win the DAVIS video segmentation challenge.
