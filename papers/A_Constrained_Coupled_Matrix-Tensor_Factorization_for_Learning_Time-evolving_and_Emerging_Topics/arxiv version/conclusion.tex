In this paper, we proposed a novel time-evolving topic discovery method which is able to identify the level of difficulty of the extracted topics. Our approach is powered by a novel Constrained Coupled Matrix-Tensor Factorization for which we provide our code at \url{https://github.com/ConCMTF/ConCMTF}. We evaluate our resulting topics both qualitatively and quantitatively via a user study of expert judges, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in discovering high-quality, interpretable topics, their temporal evolution, and their level of difficulty.  Finally, we highlight the implications of our approach in education-related applications.% and for future work we intend to further investigate this direction.

model for automatically synthesizing curriculum without human intervention given the online discussions.   
In our application, each curriculum unit corresponds to a topic extracted from the discussion.
Our experiments on large-scale data from Stack Overflow indicate our model is capable of generating desirable curriculum both in terms of extracting important curriculum units and ordering these units.
 One can improve the proposed method by considering n-grams or only  tags of the discussions. More in-depth analysis, especially evaluating the achieved curriculum by human will be necessary to extract meaningful insights.
