The objective of this study is to use the high dynamic range and low latency properties of event cameras in photometric stereo tasks to alleviate the darkroom setting problem and utilize requisite light information. Conventional RGB camera-based photometric stereo methods have limitations in adapting to an ambient light environment because of ambient illumination. Therefore, we propose EFPS-Net, which is the first approach to simultaneously accept RGB frames and event signals as input to account for the limitations of using only an RGB camera. Additionally, EFPS-Net trains with continuous light source trajectories, not discrete images, unlike the previous studies~\citep{santo2017deep,ikehata2018cnn,chen2018ps,logothetis2021px}. To prove that EFPS-Net addresses these constraints, we create a novel dataset including continuous light source trajectories. We demonstrate that our proposed method can estimate the surface normal of objects with decent quality under an ambient light environment and outperform other RGB camera-based state-of-the-art methods. % 여기
