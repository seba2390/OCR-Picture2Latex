\section{Related Work}

Over the past twenty years, there has been a lot of work done on quantum ciphers. Most of them encrypt pure quantum states as opposed to classical information. Beginning with private quantum channels \cite{pqc} whose optimality was proved later \cite{pqc-optimality}, quantum vernam ciphers were developed \cite{qe-vernam}. An optimal scheme based on quantum one-time pads \cite{qe-optimal} was proposed, later followed by characterisation of a one-way quantum encryption scheme \cite{qe-perfect} more general than private quantum channels. \\
Initially, Zhou proposed an algorithm to encrypt binary classical information \cite{qe-realqu}. Zhou then proposed qubit block encryption algorithms \cite{qbe-zhou,qbe-hk-zhou} which were later improved \cite{qe-improve-cao} to base their security on the BB84 protocol. Other than these, there have been parallel works on symmetric-key schemes \cite{qe-symmetric,qe-symm2}, a $d$-level systems' scheme \cite{qe-dlev}, and schemes based on modified BB84 \cite{qe-modbb84}, quantum key generation \cite{qbe-qkg}, conjugate coding \cite{qe-prob}, and quantum shift registers / hill cipher \cite{qe-qsrhc}. \\
Quantum public-key encryption (QPKE) schemes have been addressed by the community since the beginning of this century \cite{qpke-okamoto}. There have been QPKE schemes with information theoretic security proposed by Pan \cite{qpke-itsec-pan} and Liang \cite{qpke-itsec-liang,qpke-itsec2-liang}. Also, there have been QPKE schemes based on single qubit rotations \cite{qpke-qurot,qpke-qurot-sec} and classical NP-complete problems \cite{qpke-npc}. \\
More recently, quantum (fully) homomorphic encryption (Q(F)HE) schemes have been developed by the community. Liang proposed a perfectly secure QFHE scheme based on the quantum one-time pad \cite{qfhe-perfect}. This was followed by a QFHE scheme based on the universal quantum circuit \cite{qfhe-uqc}. Also, there has been a QHE scheme for polynomial sized circuits given by Dulek \cite{qhe-polyc}. \\
Very early, a KCQ (keyed communication in quantum noise) approach to cryptography \cite{kcq} was presented. Other works in the space of conventional quantum encryption include studies on optimality of quantum encryption schemes \cite{qe-optimality}, the use of quantum keys as opposed to classical keys \cite{qe-quantkeys}, and non-malleable ciphers \cite{nonmalleable}. Quantum secure direct communication \cite{qsdc-qe} and quantum key distribution \cite{qkd-via-qe} via quantum encryption have also been proposed. Finally, other notions of security \cite{qe-semsec-xiang,oram-sec} have been professed.
