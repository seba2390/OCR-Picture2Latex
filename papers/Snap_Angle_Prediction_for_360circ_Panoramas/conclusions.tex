We introduced the snap angle prediction problem for rendering 360$^{\circ}$ images. In contrast to previous work that assumes either a fixed or manually supplied projection angle, we propose to automatically predict the angle that will best preserve detected foreground objects. \boc{We present a framework %based on recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning 
to efficiently and accurately predict the  snap angle in novel panoramas.} 
%Through a series of experiments, 
\boc{We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, both in terms of human perception and several statistical metrics.  Future work will explore ways to generalize snap angles to video data and expand snap angle prediction to other projection models.}
