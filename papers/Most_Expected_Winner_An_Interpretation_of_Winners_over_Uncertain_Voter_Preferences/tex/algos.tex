\section{Most Expected Winner Solvers}
\label{sec:algorithms}

The problem of determining \mew can be reduced to the \esc problem (Definition~\ref{def:esc}), then further reduced to the REP by Theorem~\ref{theorem:reduction}.
This section will solve the \mew problem by solving the REP.
Proofs can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:proofs}.

\subsection{Solver for RIM-based partial orders}
\label{sec:algorithms:exact}

We adopt the RIMDP algorithm~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KenigIPKS18}, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries:pref}, to develop an exact solver for the REP over posets, and more generally, for RIM combined with posets. The exact solver only modifies the RIMDP by always tracking the target candidate, such that when RIM insertions finish, RIMDP obtains the probabilities of the target candidate being placed at each rank.

The RIMDP has exponential complexity $O(m^{\text{cw}(\bsigma, \partialOrder)+2})$, where $\text{cw}(\bsigma, \partialOrder)$ is the cover width, given the reference ranking $\bsigma$ and the partial order $\partialOrder$ ~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KenigIPKS18}. It takes $O(nm^{\text{cw}(\bsigma, \partialOrder)+3})$ to calculate \mew by executing RIMDP for all $m$ candidates and $n$ voters. 

\subsection{Solvers for Partitioned Preferences, Truncated Rankings,  and Partial Chains} 

It turns out that the \mew problem can be solved efficiently for all special cases of partial voting profiles in Figure~\ref{fig:venn_observation}, \ie the partitioned voting profile, 

\def\theoremTractabilityOfFP{
  Given a positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a fully partitioned voting profile $\fullparVP {=} (\enum[n]{\fullpar})$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \fullparVP)$ is in $O(nm^2)$.
}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:tractability_of_fullparVP}
     \theoremTractabilityOfFP
\end{theorem}

The truncated voting profiles can be solved by the same approach above, since they are a special case of the fully partitioned profile.

\def\theoremTractabilityOfPC{
  Given a positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a partial chain voting profile $\pchainVP = (\enum[n]{\pchain})$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \pchainVP)$ is in $O(nm^2)$.
}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:tractability_of_pchainVP}
    \theoremTractabilityOfPC
\end{theorem}

The \mew over partially partitioned preferences can be solved by extending the above approach for partial chain voting profiles.

\def\theoremTractabilityOfPP{
  Given a positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a partially partitioned voting profile $\parparVP = (\enum[n]{\parpar})$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \parparVP)$ is in $O(nm^2)$.
}

\end{theorem}

    \RETURN $\set{k \rightarrow \Pr(c {\rightarrow} k \mid \bsigma, \Pi) \mid k \in [1, m]}$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Solver for Probabilistic Voting Profiles}

While the problem of \mew determination is hard in general, it is tractable over specific ranking models such as the Mallows~\cite{Mallows1957} and its generalizations RIM~\cite{Doignon2004} and RSM~\cite{DBLP:journals/tdasci/ChakrabortyDKKR21}.

\def\theoremTractabilityOfRIM{
  Given positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a RIM voting profile $\rimVP = (\enum[n]{\RIM})$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \rimVP)$ is in $O(nm^4)$.
}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:tractability_of_rimVP}
    \theoremTractabilityOfRIM
\end{theorem}

The complexity of \mew determination over RSM voting profiles is $O(nm^4)$ as well.
Proof can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix:proofs}.

\subsection{Solver for Combined Voting Profiles}

It is usually harder to compute the expected scores over combined voting profiles.
Below are some cases where this problem is tractable.
The first case is the RIMs combined with truncated rankings.

\def\theoremTractabilityOfRimTrun{
  Given a positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a voting profile $\rimTrunVP {=} \big( (\RIM_1, \ranking_1^{(t_1, b_1)}), \ldots, \\(\RIM_n, \ranking_n^{(t_n, b_n)}) \big)$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \rimTrunVP)$ is in $O(nm^4)$.
}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:tractability_of_rimTrunVP}
    \theoremTractabilityOfRimTrun
\end{theorem}

Mallows combined with partitioned preferences is also tractable.

\def\theoremTractabilityOfMallowsFP{
  Given a positional scoring rule $\vr_m$, a voting profile $\mallowsPartitionVP=\big( (\mallows_1, \fullpar_1), \ldots, \\(\mallows_n, \fullpar_n) \big)$, and candidate $w$, determining $w \in \mew(\vr_m, \mallowsPartitionVP)$ is in $O(nm^4)$.
}

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:algorithms:summary}

\rev{Table~\ref{tab:complexity} summarizes all solvers in this Section, including additional conclusions for a large number of specialized voting profiles.}
For example, the complexity over Mallows voting profiles is bounded by $O(nm^4)$, since they are a special case of $\rimVP$.
An interesting observation is that the \mew complexity over $\rimPartitionVP$ is not tractable, but its special case $\mallowsPartitionVP$ has polynomial complexity.
Although this table demonstrates that evaluating \mew over probabilistic voting profiles has higher complexity than that over incomplete voting profiles (\eg $O(nm^4)$ for $\mallowsPartitionVP$ but only $O(nm^2)$ for $\fullparVP$), the tractability results over a collection of probabilistic and combined voting profiles give the \mew a computation advantage in practice.
\rev{Note that the combined voting profiles with RSM models are not covered by Table~\ref{tab:complexity}, since the complexity of determining the \mew for them is still an open question.}
