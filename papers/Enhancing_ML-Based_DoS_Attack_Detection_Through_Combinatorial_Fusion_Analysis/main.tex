\begin{abstract}
%Detecting and mitigating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks is crucial for ensuring the availability and security of online services. While various machine learning (ML) models have been utilized for DoS attack detection, there is a need for innovative approaches to improving their performance. In this paper, we propose adopting a cutting-edge approach called combinatorial fusion, which leverages recently developed algorithms to combine multiple ML models for improved DoS attack detection. Our methodology involves advanced score combination, rank combination, weighted combination techniques, and the diversity strength of scoring systems. Through rigorous performance evaluations, we showcase the efficacy of the combinatorial fusion approach. Our evaluations encompass key metrics such as detection precision, recall, and F1-score, providing comprehensive insights into the interpretability and effectiveness of our approach. We highlight the challenge faced by individual models in classifying low-profiled attacks while excelling in other attack types. To overcome this limitation, model fusion techniques were used to create a comprehensive model capable of addressing both low-profiled attacks and other traffic types. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of this approach for enhancing DoS attack detection capabilities and contributing to the development of more robust defense mechanisms.
Mitigating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks is vital for online service security and availability. While machine learning (ML) models are used for DoS attack detection, new strategies are needed to enhance their performance. We suggest an innovative method, combinatorial fusion, which combines multiple ML models using advanced algorithms. This includes score and rank combinations, weighted techniques, and diversity strength of scoring systems. Through rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this fusion approach, considering metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. We address the challenge of low-profiled attack classification by fusing models to create a comprehensive solution. Our findings emphasize the potential of this approach to improve DoS attack detection and contribute to stronger defense mechanisms.

%\section{Comments}
%\textcolor{red}{
%\begin{itemize}
    %\item Page 4: you only show 4 models, but initially you had 6 models.
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: COULD NOT FIND THIS}
    %\item Formula 1 is incomplete, missing key details.
    %\item Page 5, Fig 1: unclear. Please elaborate on it. The first five scoring systems are almost the same, you probably have an error there. If there is no error, this complete coincidence might be an issue. \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: I have done several experiments and research and it turns out that the models are giving full probability or confidence for almost all cases. This is a good thing because it tells us that the models are very confident in their predictions. However, for the purpose of what we are doing here, I am not fully sure if we still want to proceed with probability scores, due to the extremely large score ties.}
    %\\We have 6 models, but only two of them can be seen on the figure. \\ \textcolor{green}{EVANS: COULD NOT FIND THIS}
    %\item Double-check the weighted combination formulas.
    %\item Is it possible to measure the weighted combination by performance?
    %\item Page 5, rank combination vs. score combination: Based on our understanding, the smaller the better the rank is because we take the inverse of the diversity strength. \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: Right, we are already doing this}
    %\item Table 3: suspicious, Must be investigated. \\ 
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: TABLE 3 SHOULD BE CORRECT.}
    %\item Tables 3 and 4: We may need performance evaluation instead. \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: TABLE 3 AND 4 ARE EXACTLY FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}
    %\item How did you calculate the precision of each class? Please clarify this. \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: This called is the performance evaluation of a multi class classification problem. I can create a section and provide insights into this}
    %\item Figs 2 and 3: What do you mean by "under 20 results"? and what are you trying to show? \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: Those are the first 20 data items. I have changed the captions to reflect this}
    %\item Table 5: Is it a summary of Tables 3 and 4? \\
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: Table 5 is a summary of Tables 2 and 3. We can keep either of them.} 
    %\item Table 6: What is it for? It's unclear. Is it the performance evaluation of the score combination of all models?
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: Yes. that is the performance evaluation of the score combination of all models} 
    %\item The evaluation does NOT say what the top intruders are/it does not tell the performance. 
    %\textcolor{green}{EVANS: working on this now} 
%\end{itemize}}
