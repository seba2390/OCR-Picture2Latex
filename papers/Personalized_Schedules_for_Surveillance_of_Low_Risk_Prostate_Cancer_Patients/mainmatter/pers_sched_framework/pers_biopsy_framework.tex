\section{Personalized Schedules for Repeat Biopsies}
\label{sec : pers_sched_approaches}
Once a joint model for GR and PSA levels is obtained, the next step is to use it to create personalized schedules for biopsies. Let us assume that a personalized schedule is to be created for a new patient $j$, who is not present in the original sample $\mathcal{D}_n$ of patients. Further let us assume that this patient did not have a GR at his last biopsy performed at time $t$, and that the PSA levels are available up to a time point $s$. The goal is to find the optimal time $u > \mbox{max}(t,s)$ of the next biopsy.

\subsection{Algorithm}
\label{subsec : pers_sched_algorithm}
The aforementioned personalized schedules, schedule biopsy at a time $u > \mbox{max}(t,s)$. However, if time $u < T^*_j$, then GR is not detected at $u$ and at least one more biopsy is required at an optimal time $u^{new} > \mbox{max}(u,s)$. This process is repeated until GR is detected. To aid in medical decision making, we elucidate this process via an algorithm in Figure \ref{fig : sched_algorithm}. Since AS programs strongly advise that biopsies are conducted at a gap of at least one year, when $u - t < 1$, the algorithm postpones $u$ to $t + 1$, because it is the time nearest to $u$, at which the one year gap condition is satisfied.

The proposed personalized time of biopsy is denoted by $u$.  The time at which a repeat biopsy was proposed on the last visit to the hospital is denoted by $u^{pv}$. The time of the next visit for the measurement of PSA is denoted by $T^{nv}$.}
