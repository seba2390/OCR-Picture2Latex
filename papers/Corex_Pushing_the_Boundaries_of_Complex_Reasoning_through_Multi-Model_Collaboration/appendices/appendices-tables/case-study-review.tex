\textbf{Q}: Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 8717992 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove? \\

The code provided for the question is incorrect. The code erroneously calculates the number of toys Uriah needs to remove by dividing the total weight of the removed comic books by each toy's weight, neglecting the total 15 pounds Uriah aims to remove. It overlooks the weight left to be removed after the comic books are out, leading to an incorrect answer. Here's the corrected code:
