        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{CSQA}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: What do people use to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen?\\
        \textbf{Options}: (A) shirt pocket (B) calligrapher's hand (C) inkwell (D) desk drawer (E) blotter \\
        \textbf{A}: The answer must be an item that can absorb ink.\\
        Of the above choices, only blotters are used to absorb ink.\\
        So the answer is (E).\\
        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{CSQA Complexity-based}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: The building could accommodate many people. The entrance hall alone was impressive, being wide enough to admit a hundred shoulder to shoulder. But the building was owned by a billionaire and used only for his personal entertainment.  How would you describe this place? \\
        \textbf{Answer Choices}: (A) convention center (B) public building (C) large building (D) school (E) town hall \\
        \textbf{A}: The answer should be somewhere that is not for the good and convenience of the people. 
Of the above choices, large building is the only neural description of a building owned by a billionaire. So the answer is (C).\\

        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{StrategyQA}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: Could Brooke Shields succeed at the University of Pennsylvania?\\
        \textbf{A}: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. \\ 
        Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania. \\
        Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. \\ So the answer is yes. \\
        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{StrategyQA Complexity-based}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: Can jackfruit be used as a weapon? \\
        \textbf{A}: Jackfruit is the fruit of a species of plant called the Jacktree. \\
        Jackfruit can weigh up to one hundred and twenty pounds. \\
        Jackfruit is covered in little spikes. \\
        Jackfruit can be thrown or flung at an enemy. \\
        A weapon is a thing that is used to cause bodily harm. \\
        Thus, Jackfruit can be used as a weapon \\
        So the answer is yes. \\
        \midrule
        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{OpenBookQA}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: As you look deeper into a Marbel you can see \\
        \textbf{Options}: (A) the future (B) minut defects (C) colors (D) the other side \\
        \textbf{A}: Marbel is not transparent, so you can not see the other side. \\ 
        Marbel does not necessarily have multiple colors. \\
        You will see minut defects. \\ 
        So the answer is (B). \\
        \midrule
        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{ARC-c}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: George wants to warm his hands quickly by rubbing them. Which skin surface will produce the most heat? \\
        \textbf{Options}:  (A) dry palms. (B) wet palms. (C) palms covered with oil. (D) palms covered with lotion. \\
        \textbf{A}: Dry surfaces will more likely cause more friction via rubbing than other smoother surfaces,\\
        hence dry palms will produce the most heat. \\
        So the answer is (A).\\
        \midrule
        \underline{\textbf{\textsc{BoolQ}}} \\
        \textbf{Q}: is a cello and a bass the same thing? \\
        \textbf{A}: The cello is played sitting down with the instrument between the knees, \\ 
        whereas the double bass is played standing or sitting on a stool. \\ So the answer is no.\\
