\textbf{Q}: Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? \\
\textbf{Options:} \\
(A) 12/14/2026 \\
(B) 12/14/1950 \\
(C) 12/14/2007 \\
(D) 12/14/1937 \\
(E) 07/14/1938 \\
(F) 12/14/1988 \\
\textbf{A}: Let's think step by step. \\
If today is Christmas Eve of 1937, then today's date is December 24, 1937. \\
10 days before today is December 14, 1937, that is 12/14/1937. So the answer is (D). \\

 \textbf{Q}: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
\begin{minted}[breaklines, fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
# solution using Python:
# Q: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
# If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then today is 36 hours before.
today = datetime(2015, 1, 1) - relativedelta(hours=36)
# One week from today,
one_week_from_today = today + relativedelta(weeks=1)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
one_week_from_today.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
