\section{Limitations and Broader Impacts}

Considering performance constraints, 
open-source models were not incorporated in this study. 
However,
we hold the view that the collaboration of several relatively weaker open-source models~\citep{zhang2022opt, touvron2023llama2} might enable them to conquer tasks that only stronger commercial models~\citep{bai2022training, openai2023gpt4} could previously accomplish.
Since we have empirically demonstrated that model collaboration can help reduce redundant computations and resource usage, 
it is foreseeable that the efficiency can be further accentuated when integrating open-source models into the collaboration framework, making the development of general artificial intelligence more sustainable~\citep{hessenthaler2022bridging}.
Also,
this may enhance the diversity to address the issues of biases and misconceptions inherent to a single model~\citep{sun2022bertscore, shaikh2023second} can be mitigated, 
promoting the fairness of future AI systems~\citep{hendrycks2021aligning}.

At the same time, 
we also observe the emergence of instability when integrating the functions of multiple LLMs.
This highlights the need for better strategies to orchestrate the interaction among models with unique attributes and capabilities~\citep{parsons2003arg, dorri2018agentsurvey}, % multi agent system 
which we identified as a pivotal direction for future research.
