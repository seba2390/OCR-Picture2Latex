\section{Conclusion}

We introduce \ours in this paper,
a suite of strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents, 
thereby leveraging multi-model collaboration for complex reasoning. 
This offers a preliminary exploration into the LLM-based multi-model ecosystems.
Through unlocking the synergies among LLMs,
\ours empowers reasoning with enhanced factuality, 
faithfulness, 
and reliability through various collaboration paradigms.
We conduct extensive evaluations across 18 tasks within 4 categories, 
and the results demonstrate superior performance compared to previous solutions.
Moreover,
our methods also exhibit multiple notable advantages including being task-agnostic,
cost-effective,
and annotation-efficient.
We hope that this work may serve as a foundation for further research, 
offering novel perspectives in complex reasoning, 
collective intelligence, 
and autonomous agents.
