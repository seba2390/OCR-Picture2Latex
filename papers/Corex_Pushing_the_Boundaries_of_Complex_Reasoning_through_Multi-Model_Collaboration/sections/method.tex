% \subsection{General Settings}

We introduce the three main components of \ours in this section, 
namely the Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes.
Let us assume a set of LLM-based agents $\{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}$ participating in multi-model collaboration.
Each agent $A_i$ generates the corresponding reasoning chain $c_i$ and its prediction $p_i$ when facing a query $q$.
% or generates the response $r_i$ along with its updated prediction $p_i'$ when receiving outputs from other models.
