\begin{abstract}
Routing control is one of important traffic management strategies against urban congestion. However, it could be compromised by heterogeneous drivers’ non-compliance with routing instructions. In this article we model the compliance in a stochastic manner and investigate its impacts on routing control. We consider traffic routing for two parallel links. Particularly, we consider two scenarios: one ignores congestion spillback while the other one considers it. We formulate the problem as a non-linear Markov chain, given random drivers’ adherence. Then we propose the stability and instability conditions to reveal when the routing is able or unable to stabilize the traffic. We show that for links without congestion spillback there exists a sufficient and necessary stability criterion. For links admiting congestion propagation, we present one stability condition and one instability condition. This stability conditions allow us to quantify the impacts of drivers' non-compliance on the two-link network in terms of throughput. Finally, we illustrate the results with a set of numerical examples.
