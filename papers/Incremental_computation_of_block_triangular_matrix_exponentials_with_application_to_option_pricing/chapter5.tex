\section{Summary and future work}


We have presented techniques for scaling and squaring algorithms that
allow for the incremental computation of block triangular matrix
exponentials.  We combined these techniques with an adaptive scaling
strategy that allows for both fast and accurate computation of each
matrix exponential in this sequence (Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptive}).
For our application in polynomial diffusion models, the run time can
be further reduced by using fixed scaling parameter, determined
through the estimation techniques in Lemmas~\ref{lemmanormJ}
and~\ref{lem:heston_est}.

We observed in our numerical experiments that accurate approximations
to these matrix exponentials can be obtained even for quite small,
fixed scaling parameters.  For the case of two-by-two block triangular
matrices, the results of Dieci and Papini~\cite{Dieci2000,Dieci2001}
support this finding, but an extension of these results to cover a
more general setting would be appreciable.
