We study the problem of computing the matrix exponential of a block
triangular matrix in a peculiar way: Block column by block column,
from left to right.  The need for such an evaluation scheme arises
naturally in the context of option pricing in polynomial diffusion
models.  In this setting a discretization process produces a sequence
of nested block triangular matrices, and their exponentials are to be
computed at each stage, until a dynamically evaluated criterion allows
to stop.  Our algorithm is based on scaling and squaring.  By
carefully reusing certain intermediate quantities from one step to the
next, we can efficiently compute such
a sequence of matrix exponentials.
