Fortin and Reutenauer defined the non-commutative rank for a matrix with entries that are linear functions. The  non-commutative rank is related to stability in invariant theory,
non-commutative arithmetic circuits, and Edmonds' problem. We will generalize the  non-commutative rank to the representation theory of quivers and define 
non-commutative Hom and Ext spaces. We will relate these new notions  to King's criterion for $\sigma$-stability
of quiver representations, and the general Hom and Ext spaces studied by Schofield. We discuss polynomial time algorithms that compute
the non-commutative Homs and Exts and find an optimal witness for the $\sigma$-semi-stability
of a quiver representation.

\section{Introduction}
Given $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_m$, $n\times n$ matrices over a field $\F$, and $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m$, variables in the free skew-field defined by Cohn in \cite{Cohn95}, Fortin and Reutenauer \cite{FR04} defined the non-commutative rank $\ncrk(A(\underline{x}))$ as the rank of 
the matrix of linear functions $A(\underline{x})=x_1A_1+x_2A_2+\cdots+x_mA_m$ over the free skew field. The non-commutative rank $\ncrk(A(\underline{x}))$ is also equal to the maximal value of 
%$\rk(X_1\otimes A_1+X_2\otimes A_2+\cdots+X_n\otimes A_n)/d$ 
$$\frac{\rk(X_1\otimes A_1+X_2\otimes A_2+\cdots+X_n\otimes A_n)}{d}
$$
where $d$ is a positive integer and $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n$ are $d\times d$ matrices. A third characterization of non-commutative rank is in terms of shrunk subspaces.
Non-commutative rank is related to the notion of stability in geometric invariant theory. Consider the action of $\SL_n\times \SL_n$ on the space $\Mat_{n,n}^m$ of $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ matrices by left-right multiplication.
Then $\underline{A}=(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_m)$ is semi-stable with respect to this action if and only if $A(\underline{x})$ has full non-commutative rank, i.e., $\ncrk(A(\underline{x}))$ is equal to the maximal value $n$.

The example of $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ matrices fits in the broader framework of representation theory of quivers. A quiver $Q$ is just a directed graph,
with vertex set $Q_0$ and arrow set $Q_1$.
If we consider the generalized Kronecker quiver $Q$ with two vertices, say $x$ and $y$, and $m$ arrows from $x$ to $y$
and we choose the dimension vector $\alpha=(n,n)$, then the representation space $\Rep_\alpha(Q)$ of $\alpha$-dimensional representations of $Q$ is equal to $\Mat_{n,n}^m$. To construct a moduli space of $\alpha$-dimensional representations one needs to quotient out the $\SL_n\times \SL_n$ action. The goal of this paper is to generalize the notion of non-commutative rank and its properties to arbitrary quivers and dimension vectors. Geometric invariant theory for quiver representations was studied by King in \cite{King94}. For every quiver $Q$, dimension vector $\alpha\in \Z_{\geq 0}^{Q_0}$ and weight $\sigma\in \Z^{Q_0}$
King constructed a quotient for $\alpha$-dimensional representations of $Q$ with respect to the weight $\sigma$.
So for every weight $\sigma$ there is a notion of semi-stability for quiver representations and King gave a criterion  $\sigma$-semi-stability of a representation of~$Q$. 

In this paper, we connect non-commutative rank to $\sigma$-semi-stability of quiver representations. Through King's Criterion \cite{King94}, we discuss the importance of special subrepresentations that are optimal in witnessing the $\sigma$-semi-stability. We provide a framework to use existing algorithms to find these optimal $\sigma$-witnesses, as well as provide an algorithm using a sequence of subrepresentations. We then generalize work of Schofield on pairs of general representations, general ext, and general hom to pairs with one representation fixed, non-commutative ext, and non-commutative hom. We conclude by using non-commutative rank methods to demonstrate useful inequalities for the non-commutative ext. 

The Edmonds' problem, posed in 1967, asks to determine the rank of the $n\times n$ matrix $A(\underline{x})$, with homogeneous linear polynomials in $\Z[x_1,\ldots,x_m]$ over $\Q(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$ \cite{Edm67}. The decision version of this question, asking whether $A(\underline{x})$ has full rank or not, is known as the symbolic determinant identity testing problem (SDIT). We are considering instead the rank of $A(\underline{x})$ over the free skew field, and so the question of finding $\ncrk(A)$ is the \emph{non-commutative Edmonds' problem}, and the relaxation in simply deciding whether $A(\underline{x})$ has full non-commutative rank is the \emph{non-commutative full rank problem} (NCFullRank). Letting $\A=\Span\{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n\}$, we alternatively denote the non-commutative rank of $A(\underline{x})$ by $\ncrk(\A)$. Ivanyos, Qiao, and Subrahmanyam give equivalent formulations and history of NCFullRank in \cite{IQS17}. We are interested in the $c$-shrunk subspace, tensor blow-up, and particularly the nullcone formulations, which are discussed in Section~\ref{ncrkdefs}.

Lots of work from different angles has been done on this non-commutative rank. Cohn and Reutenauer proved NCFullRank was in PSPACE (can be solved using polynomial space) \cite{CR99}. Fortin and Reutenauer connected non-commutative rank explicitly to $c$-shrunk subspaces \cite{FR04}. Coming from studying non-commutative arithmetic circuits with divisions, Hrubes and Wigderson proved that non-commutative rank was equivalent to rank for large enough tensor blow-ups \cite{HW14}. Garg, Gurvitz, Oliveira, and Wigderson provide a polynomial time algorithm of non-commutative rank for fields of characteristic zero. In \cite{IKQS15}, for certain matrix spaces, Karpinski, Ivanyos, Subrahmanyam, and Qiao use Wong sequences to calculate the non-commutative rank. Building on this using blow-ups, the latter three authors provide an algorithm for finding the non-commutative rank of any matrix space \cite{IQS17}. Utilizing results on bounds from \cite{DM18b}, in \cite{IQS18}, they give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm.  

This problem can be expanded to that of finding a subrepresentation of a quiver representation $W$ that demonstrates the representation's semi-stability. This \emph{optimal $\sigma$-witness}, $W'$, can be found using algorithms finding a $c$-shrunk subsapce of a certain matrix space. Work by Chindris and Kline connect this problem to that of simultaneous robust subspace recovery (SRSR) \cite{CK20a}, and provide an algorithm for certifying the semi-stability of $W$ \cite{CK21B}.

In \cite{Scho92}, Schofield explored the dimension of $\Hom(V,W)$ and $\Ext(V,W)$ for a fixed quiver representation $V$, and generic quivers representation $W$ and $V$. This work was generalized by Crawley-Boevey, who described the asymptotic behavior of these dimensions when one of $W$ or $V$ is fixed (rather than both generic) \cite{Craw96}. We re-prove many of these results using insights from non-commutative rank methods, ultimately leading us to a bound on the asymptotic behavior.
