\section{Conclusion  \& Perspectives}
In this paper, we used opacity, a generalization of many security properties, as a means to track the information flow in an IoT-based medical application. We introduced a model to analyze the behavior of an IoT-based heart attack detection system discussing how an observer may infer personal patient information. Our work aims at detecting security leaks in our system, using SOG-based algorithms for the on-the-fly verification of opacity variants (simple, $K$-step weak, and $K$-step strong opacity). We have also proposed a novel, SOG-based approach for opacity enforcement of Petri net-modeled systems. The main contribution of this work is to propose an efficient algorithm for enforcing simple opacity by padding the system with minimal dummy behavior. In our future research, we will explore the same idea of enforcement for other opacity variants such as $K$-step weak and $K$-step strong opacity. Furthermore, we also hope to extend this work to take into account different types of enforcement, such as supervisory control for opacity and finding the supremal sub-language, instead of computing the minimal super-language.
