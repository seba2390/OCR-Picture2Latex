\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present TransAct,  a transformer-based realtime user action model that effectively captures users' short-term interests by encoding their realtime actions.
Our novel hybrid ranking model merges the strengths of both realtime and batch approaches of encoding user actions, and has been successfully deployed in the Homefeed recommendation system at Pinterest. 
The results of our offline experiments indicate that TransAct significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommender system baselines.  
 In addition, we have discussed and provided solutions for the challenges faced during online experimentation, such as high serving complexity, diversity decrease, and engagement decay. 
 The versatility and effectiveness of TransAct make it applicable for other tasks, such as contextual recommendations and search ranking.
