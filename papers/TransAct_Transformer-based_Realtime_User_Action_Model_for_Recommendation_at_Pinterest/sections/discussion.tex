An interesting finding from our online experiment is that the true potential of TransAct is not fully captured. We observed a greater improvement in performance when the model was deployed as the production Homefeed ranking model for full traffic. This is due to the effect of a positive feedback loop: as users experience a more responsive Homefeed built on TransAct, they tend to engage with more relevant content, leading to changes in their behavior (such as more clicks or repins). These changes in behavior lead to shifts in the realtime user sequence feature, which are then used to generate new training data. Retraining the Homefeed ranking model with this updated data results in a positive compounding effect, leading to a higher engagement rate and a stronger feedback loop. This phenomenon is similar to "direct feedback loops" in literature~\cite{tech_debt} which refers to a model that directly influences the selection of its own future training data, and it is more difficult to detect if they occur gradually over time.

\subsection{TransAct in Other Tasks}
The versatility of TransAct extends beyond just ranking tasks. It has been successfully applied in the contextual recommendation and search ranking scenarios as well. 
% Our implementation of TransAct has shown remarkable results in various applications.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Related Pins}~\cite{related_pins} use a contextual recommendation model to provide personalized recommendations of pins based on a given query pin. Using TransAct and putting query pin in the early fusion stage achieved +2-4\% repin volume on Related Pin.
%     \item TransAct was also applied in Pinterest's \textbf{Search} ranking~\cite{search_blog} system and was able to boost repin volume by 2.3\% without hurting search relevance.
%     \item In \textbf{notification} ranking~\cite{pins_notif}, TransAct is used to predict notification labels (e.g. email clicks) and leads to +1.38\% email click through rate and +1.89\% push notification open rate.
% \end{itemize}
% These results clearly showcase the effectiveness of TransAct in a variety of use cases and its potential to drive engagement in more real-world applications.
