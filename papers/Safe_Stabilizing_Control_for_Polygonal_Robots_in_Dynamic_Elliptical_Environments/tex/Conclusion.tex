\section{Conclusion}

We present an analytic distance formula between elliptical and polygonal objects.  Leveraging this formula, we construct a time-varying control barrier function that ensures the safe autonomy of a polygon-shaped robot operating in dynamical elliptical environments. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated in rigid-body navigation and multi-link robot arm problems. 
% \& Future Work
Future work will consider extending the formulation to 3-D environments (e.g. drone navigation, robot arm manipulation) and estimating the geometry and dynamics of the environment with on-board sensing.
