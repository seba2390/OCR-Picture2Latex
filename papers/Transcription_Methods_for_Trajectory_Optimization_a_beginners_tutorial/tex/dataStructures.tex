\section{Data Structures}

I've found that one of the biggest sources for mistakes in writing trajectory optimization code is in collecting all of the various parts of the problem into a generic form that can be passed to a standard nonlinear optimization package. SNOPT requires that the decision variables be passed as a vector, and FMINCON requires that they be passed as a matrix (or vector/scalar). For multiple shooting, there are often several different types of decision variables, which are not simple to write as a matrix/vector. Consider a trajectory optimization to find the optimal walking trajectory for the Cornell Ranger (using a piecewise linear discritization of the controls):

\begin{itemize} \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

	\item{\bf Single Stance States - } [8 x N] matrix
	\item{\bf Single Stance Input - } [2 x (N+1)] matrix
	\item{\bf Single Stance Duration - } scalar
	\item{\bf Double Stance States - } [12 x M] matrix
	\item{\bf Double Stance Input - } [3 x (M+1)] matrix
	\item{\bf Single Stance States - } scalar

\end{itemize}

I've found that the best thing to do is to store each of these items as a single field in a struct (using Matlab for now). I then pass this struct to a special function that returns a new data structure that contains the field names, the order of the fields, and the size of each field. This function also returns all of the data from the struct collapsed into a single vector. This function is designed to work in both ways, so that calling it using a vector of data and the struct of field information will return a struct of data.

\par By writing a conversion function, between data struct and data vector, I can write all of the multiple shooting code using the data struct, and then just do a conversion before and after each interaction with the optimization algorithm. This makes all of the code that you write more readable, because you never have to reference a value using it's index in a vector. 

\par The program GPOPS takes this organization scheme to a new level by doing the struct to vector conversion itself, so you only ever work with the named variables in a struct.
