Multiple shooting is a common way to solve a trajectory optimization problem. This document is an overview of the practical details that have helped me implement multiple shooting algorithms. Once a trajectory optimization problem has been posed using multiple shooting, it can then be passed to a nonlinear optimization package, such as SNOPT or FMINCON. The suggestions in this document are based on experience, not rigerous experiments. If something doesn't quite make sense then you should test it yourself (and let me know if you find anything interesting!).
