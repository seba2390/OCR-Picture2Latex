\subsection{Grid Selection}

Both shooting and simultaneous methods have some free parameter(s) that control the grid that it is used to transcribe the problem. In general, you need a fine grid for an accurate solution, but this can cause convergence problems if the initial guess is not very good. A common solution is to use a very coarse grid to find an approximate solution, and then use this approximate solution as an initial guess for a second, or third, optimization using a finer grid. The commercially available program GPOPS II handles this grid-refinement automatically using a sophisticated algorithm \cite{Darby2011a}.
