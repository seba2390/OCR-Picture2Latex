Probabilistic timed automata (PTAs) are timed automata (TAs) extended with discrete probability distributions.
They serve as a mathematical model for a wide range of applications that involve both stochastic and timed behaviours.
In this work, we consider the problem of model-checking linear \emph{dense-time} properties over {PTAs}.
In particular, we study linear dense-time properties that can be encoded by TAs with infinite acceptance criterion.
First, we show that the problem of model-checking PTAs against deterministic-TA specifications can be solved through a product construction.
Based on the product construction, we prove that the computational complexity of the problem with deterministic-TA specifications is EXPTIME-complete.
Then we show that when relaxed to general (nondeterministic) TAs, the model-checking problem becomes undecidable.
Our results substantially extend state of the art with both the dense-time feature and the nondeterminism in TAs.
