\subsection{Data Partitioning} \label{subsec: Data_partitioning}
A data partitioning stage was carried out to divide the database into different training and test sets. Specifically, $\frac{4}{5}$ of the circumpapillary images, which corresponds to 73 glaucomatous and 124 normal samples, from 12 and 18 patients respectively, composed the training set, whereas the test set was defined by $\frac{1}{5}$ of the data (20 with glaucoma and 32 normal B-scans from 12 and 18 patients). In addition, for the training set, we also performed an internal cross-validation (ICV) stage to control the overfitting, as well as to select the best neural network hyper-parameters. Finally, the independent test set was used to evaluate the definitive predictive models, which were created using the entire training set.
