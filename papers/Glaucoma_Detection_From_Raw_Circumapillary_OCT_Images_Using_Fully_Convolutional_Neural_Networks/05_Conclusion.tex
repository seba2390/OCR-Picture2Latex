\section{Conclusion} \label{sec: Conclusion}

In this paper, two different deep-learning methodologies have been performed to elucidate the added value enclosed in the circumpapillary OCT images for glaucoma detection. The reported results suggest the fine-tuned VGG family of architectures as the most promising networks. The extracted CAMs evidence the great potential of the proposed model since it is able to highlight areas such as the RNFL, in line with the clinical interpretation. In future research lines, external validation of the proposed strategy with large databases is considered.
