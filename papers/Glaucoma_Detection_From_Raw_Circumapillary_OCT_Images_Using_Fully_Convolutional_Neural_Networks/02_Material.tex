The experiments detailed in this paper were performed on a private database composed of 249 OCT images of dimensions $M\times N=496\times768$ pixels. In particular, 156 normal and 93 glaucomatous circumpapillary samples were analysed from 89 and 59 patients, respectively. Each B-scan was diagnosed by experts ophthalmologists from Oftalvist Ophthalmic Clinic. Note that \textit{Heidelberg Spectrallis} OCT system was employed to acquire the circumpapillary OCT images with an axial resolution of 4-5 $\mu$m.
