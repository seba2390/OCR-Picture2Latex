\abstract{
The predominant method for generating Lattice QCD configurations is Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC). In order to speed up this generation,
a wide range of preconditioning techniques that modify the lattice action have been devised.
This work compares the performance of the well-known Hasenbusch preconditioning technique with the polynomial filtering technique on a small $16^3 \times 32$ lattice with two flavours of Wilson fermions at a pion mass $M_{\pi} \sim 400$~MeV.
We explore a novel method of combining polynomial and Hasenbusch filters, revealing a speedup when compared to the standard two Hasenbusch filters. This comes with the added advantage of simplified tuning.
