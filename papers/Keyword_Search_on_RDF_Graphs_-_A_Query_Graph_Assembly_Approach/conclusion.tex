\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose a two-phase framework to interpret keyword queries. Different from existing work, we model the keyword search task as assembling a query graph $Q$ to express the query intention. In our solution, the two challenge issues---keyword mapping disambiguation and query structure disambiguation are integrated into one model. We adopt the graph embedding technique (TransE) to measure the goodness of query graphs, which improves the accuracy. Although QGA is proved to be NP-complete, we propose a practical efficient and scalable search algorithm.
