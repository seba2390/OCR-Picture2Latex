\caption{The Impact of Decoy Sub-types on Decoy Cheaper Bias Score for Real-Estate Products in DaVinci-003. Sub-types include \textit{F} (same price, worse quality), \textit{R} and \textit{R*} (higher price, same quality), and \textit{RF} (higher price, worse quality). In contrast to humans, the DaVinci-003 model does not show a strong shift in bias score for different decoy sub-types.}
