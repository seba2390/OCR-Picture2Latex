\caption{The Effect of price range on the bias score of the decoy cheaper bias with real-estate products in the Flan-T5-XXL model. The x-axis represents the target price, where an increase in the target price leads to a wider gap between the target and competitor prices. The bias score demonstrates a positive correlation with the increasing price gap, except for the \$100K price where the model chose the competitor 100\% of the time.}
