\caption{The relationship between bias scores and model accuracy on the belief bias task's logical reasoning aspect for the DaVinci, DaVinci-002, and DaVinci-003 models. Notably, an increase in model accuracy is accompanied by higher bias scores, indicating that improved accuracy does not necessarily mitigate biases in these models.}
