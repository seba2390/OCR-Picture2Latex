\caption{The impact of format few-shots on bias scores using Davinci-003. The utilization of few-shot examples results in slightly lower bias scores. To reduce computation costs, bias scores for Decoy Expensive and Decoy Cheaper biases are calculated solely on a specific product category (real-estate properties).}
