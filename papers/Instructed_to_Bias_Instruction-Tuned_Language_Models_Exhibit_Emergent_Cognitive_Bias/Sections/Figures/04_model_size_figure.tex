\caption{
The impact of model size on bias scores. The larger Flan-T5-XXL (green) exhibits higher bias scores in decoy cheaper, certainty, and belief valid biases while demonstrating lower bias scores in decoy expensive and belief invalid biases compared to the smaller Flan-T5-XL (red). The decoy expensive bias discrepancy may stem from Flan-T5-XXL's preference for higher-priced products, while the belief invalid bias reduction can be attributed to the model's enhanced accuracy with neutral arguments.}

\caption{Acceptance rates of the Flan-T5 models on believable (green) and unbelievable (red) arguments in the \biaseddataset condition and on neutral arguments in the control condition (blue) divided into valid and invalid arguments. The Belief Invalid bias score for the larger Flan-T5-XXL model (lower) seems lower compared to the smaller Flan-T5-XL (upper) because the model is less successful on the neutral arguments (blue).}
