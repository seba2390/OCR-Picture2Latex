\section{Conclusions}

Our investigation into cognitive biases in LMs fine-tuned on instructions and human feedback reveals their presence and prominence. We observe biases such as the decoy effect, the certainty effect, and the belief bias across these models.
Despite efforts to mitigate biases, some still persist in LMs.
This work contributes to understanding and addressing cognitive biases in instruction-tuned large LMs, aiming to develop more reliable and unbiased language models for practical applications.
