\caption{
Illustrative examples of the three evaluated Biases. Red text indicates disruptive elements fueling the bias. Blue text represents control responses unhindered by bias, while green text denotes treatment responses influenced by bias. The decoy effect in the first row presents a scenario where two prize options are compared, the certainty effect in the second row involves selecting products with varying prices and quality measurements, and the belief bias in the third row entails evaluating the validity of logical syllogisms. In the certainty effect and decoy Effect, the model is tasked with choosing its preferred option, whereas in the belief bias, the model determines the conclusion's validity. Each bias is evaluated using a control and a \biaseddataset{} datasets. A shift in choice patterns is anticipated from model predictions on samples transitioning from the control dataset to the \biaseddataset{}. %\gabis{I think that this is an important table, and can benefit from some formmating, e.g., color or markups to emphasize what's different between control and treatment for example}
