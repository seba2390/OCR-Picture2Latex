\section{Background}

\subsection{Why is moderation hard}

We can start of by describing the current moderation techniques and how they are not scalable. Moreover, we can describe how difficult it is to decide the rules and then decide whether content is adhering to rules or not. Finally, we can also describe how Reddit or other platforms have evolved from starting off with bastion of free speech and then slowly evolving their moderation and becoming ever so slightly more restrictive.

\subsection{Why would reddit be reactive}
We should come up with reasons for why reddit is reactive, however in the paper we will not be focusing on these reasons. These are just here as part of the setup.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lack of knowledge. \\
    Reddit is not aware of the subreddit or its violation
    \item Lack of clarity. \\
    Whether the subreddit has actually violated or not. 
    \item Fear of losing users. \\
    Banning the violating subreddit will result in loss of users.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User, Administration and Investors relationship with toxicity}
\textit{Monetization and moderation}
Deciding the rules and deciding the level of moderation is imperative to the monetization of a platform. There are two ways moderation and monetization of a platform are related, 1) moderation can influence the number of users there are on the site 2) low moderation can influence advertisers to not advertise or investors to not invest.
