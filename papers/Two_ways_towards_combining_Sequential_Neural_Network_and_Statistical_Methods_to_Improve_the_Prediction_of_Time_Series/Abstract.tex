    Statistic modeling and data-driven learning are the two vital fields that attract many attentions. Statistic models intend to capture and interpret the relationships among variables, while data-based learning attempt to extract information directly from the data without pre-processing through complex models. Given the extensive studies in both fields, a subtle issue is how to properly integrate data based methods with existing knowledge or models. In this paper, based on the time series data, we propose two different directions to integrate the two, a decomposition-based method and a method exploiting the statistic extraction of data features. The first one decomposes the data into linear stable, nonlinear stable and unstable parts, where suitable statistical models are used for the linear stable and nonlinear stable parts while the appropriate machine learning tools are used for the unstable parts. The second one applies statistic models to extract statistics features of data and feed them as additional inputs into the machine learning platform for training. The most critical and challenging thing is how to determine and extract the valuable information from mathematical or statistical models to boost the performance of machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the proposal
    using  time series data with varying degrees of stability.  Performance results show that both methods can outperform existing schemes that use models and learning separately, and the improvements can be over 60\%. Both our proposed methods are promising in bridging the gap between model-based and data-driven schemes and integrating the two to provide an overall higher learning performance.

    % Model based and data based learning are the two vital fields attracting many attentions. Model based learning utilizes mathematical models to capture and interpret the inner relationships among the variables; while data based learning attempt to extract information directly from the data without pre-processing through complex models. A subtle issue is how to properly integrate data based methods with existing knowledge or models. In this paper, based on the time series data, we propose two different directions to incorporate data based and model based learning. Specifically, we formulate a decomposition based method and a statistic extraction based method. The first one decomposes the data into linear stable, nonlinear stable and unstable parts. The suitable statistical models are used for the linear stable and nonlinear stable parts while the appropriate machine learning tools are used for the unstable parts. The second one uses mathematical statistics models to model first, then extracts valuable statistics information, and finally feeds the extracted statistics as new features into the machine learning learner for training. The most critical point is how to extract valuable information from mathematical or statistical models to boost the performance of machine learning learners. We evaluate the proposal empirically using  time series data with varying degrees of stability, compare the one-step and multiple steps prediction performance  and find that the proposed method advances the state-of-the-art when compared to existing baseline methods.
