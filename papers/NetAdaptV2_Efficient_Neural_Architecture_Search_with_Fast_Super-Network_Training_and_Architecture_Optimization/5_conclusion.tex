\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose NetAdaptV2, an efficient neural architecture search algorithm, which significantly reduces the total search time and discovers DNNs with state-of-the-art accuracy-latency/accuracy-MAC trade-offs. 
NetAdaptV2 better balances the time spent per step and supports non-differentiable search metrics. This is realized by the proposed methods: channel-level bypass connections, ordered dropout, and multi-layer coordinate descent optimizer. The experiments demonstrate that NetAdaptV2 can reduce the total search time by up to $5.8\times$ on image classification and $2.4\times$ on depth estimation and discover DNNs with better performance than state-of-the-art works.
