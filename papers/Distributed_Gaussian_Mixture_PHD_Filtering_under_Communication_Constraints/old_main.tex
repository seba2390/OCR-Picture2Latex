        The Gaussian Mixture Particle Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter is an almost exact closed-form approximation to the Bayes-optimal multi-target tracker. Due to its optimality guarantees and ease of implementation, it has been studied extensively in the literature. However, the challenges involved in implementing the GM-PHD filter in a distributed (multi-sensor) setting have received little attention. In particular, the existing solutions for distributed PHD filtering require a large amount of communication between the sensors, which are infeasible for use in distributed sensor networks having communication constraints.      
        In this paper, we develop a distributed GM-PHD filtering recursion that uses a probabilistic communication rule to fuse the sensors' posterior densities. In addition to having an asymptotic convergence guarantee, the proposed algorithm is able to avoid the issue of false positives, which has previously been noted to impact the filtering performance of distributed multi-target tracking.
