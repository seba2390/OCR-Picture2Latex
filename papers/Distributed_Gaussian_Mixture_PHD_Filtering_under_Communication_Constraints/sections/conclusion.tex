In this paper, an asymptotically optimal distributed Gaussian-Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter was developed for multi-sensor multi-target tracking under communication constraints. Unlike the existing implementations of distributed GM-PHD filtering given in the literature, the proposed method is able to guarantee asymptotic convergence to an optimal multi-target state estimate, which corresponds to the weighted arithmetic average (WAA) of the posterior densities of the sensors. A novel result related to the consensus of functions in $L^p$ spaces was developed in order to establish the convergence properties of the consensus-based GM-PHD filtering method. Subsequently, a random sampling rule was developed, which uses probabilistic sampling of GM components to limit the amount of information that is transmitted between sensors in the inter-sensor fusion step, thereby limiting the communication cost of the proposed method. Through numerical simulations, it was shown that the proposed method (which uses the random sampling rule) exhibits a much better multi-target tracking performance than a comparable algorithm from the literature, while requiring the same (or lesser) amount of communication, thereby striking a desirable trade-off between the aforementioned metrics that is well-suited for distributed sensor networks having communication constraints.
