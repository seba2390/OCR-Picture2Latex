\paragraph{Ethics Statement} This work primarily presents no direct ethical concerns. However, from a broader impact perspective, there are some potential implications related to systematic impact and possible misuse. These concerns are detailed further in the \Autoref{sec:broad}.

% \paragraph{Reproducibility Statement}
% To ensure reproducibility, the main paper offers an in-depth exposition of the materials and experimental configurations. The organization is as follows:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \Autoref{sec2:method} - This section provides the details of the noisy instructions employed throughout our experiments. The accompanying pseudocode offers a more technical breakdown.
%     \item \Autoref{sec3:experiment} - This section elaborates on the implementation specifics, including the pre-trained models, datasets, and evaluation metrics used. Additionally, the appendix furnishes the input format for models in the \textsc{SupNatInst} dataset, offering further clarity on the dataset description. 
%     \item \Autoref{sec:futher_exp} - This section delves into the origins and specifications of the instruction-tuned models employed in our study.
%     \item \Autoref{metric_details} - Detailed methodologies for evaluating models using our proposed metrics, LA and LC, are elaborated upon in this section.
%     \item \Autoref{sec:additional} - Comprehensive experimental configurations for integrating ID with other decoding techniques are documented. The expected responses from instances utilizing ID are also enumerated in this section.
