This paper has presented the concept of holistic power system testing to allow for an integrated test of smart grid solutions conducted in different RI.
An approach towards a holistic testing procedure has been proposed.
First results of the approach have been outlined and an exemplification of the outcome given.

In future work, the concepts and definitions will be adapted and refined. The methodological work is strongly interlinked with practical realisation of a holistic testing system and results and experiences will be taken into account in specifying the holistic testing procedure.
A core element is the development of the mapping process from a holistic test to sub-tests and RI that will build on the work presented here.
Concepts from design of experiments will be investigated for coupling results of tests from different RI.
