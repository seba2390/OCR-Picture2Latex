Accurate specification of standard occupational classification (SOC) code is critical to the success of many U.S.~work visa applications. Determination of correct SOC code relies on  careful study of job requirements and comparison to definitions given by the U.S.~Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is often a tedious activity. In this paper, we apply methods from natural language processing (NLP) to computationally determine SOC code based on job description. We implement and empirically evaluate a broad variety of predictive models with respect to quality of prediction and training time, and identify models best suited for this task.
