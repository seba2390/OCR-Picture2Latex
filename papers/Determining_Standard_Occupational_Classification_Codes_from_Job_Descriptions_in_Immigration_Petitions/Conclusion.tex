Accurate determination of Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes is critical to the success and timely completion of U.S.~work visa applications. In this paper, we have applied machine to reduce the repetitive workload of SOC code selection. Using methods from natural language processing, we have trained a variety of predictive models for determining SOC code based on job description. Using real world data, we have benchmarked these models with respect to quality of prediction and training time. Our results indicate that our approach results in highly accurate models that may be trained and deployed within reasonable timelines.

Several useful extensions of this work are possible. For example, the functionality of the models may be expanded to return a list of suggested SOC codes ranked by some confidence metric. Another improvement would be to incorporate statistical significance tests (e.g., Student's t-test) into the model comparison process.
