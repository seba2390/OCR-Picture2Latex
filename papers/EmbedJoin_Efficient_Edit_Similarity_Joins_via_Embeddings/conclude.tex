\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

We propose an algorithm named \ebdjoin+ for computing edit similarity join, one of the most important operations in database systems.  Different from all previous approaches, we first embed the input strings from the edit space to the Hamming space, and then try to perform a filtering (for reducing candidate pairs) in the Hamming space where efficient tools like locality sensitive hashing are available.  Our experiments have shown that \ebdjoin+ significantly outperforms, at a very small cost of accuracy, all existing algorithms on long strings and large thresholds.
%, which are critical to applications such as the analysis of genome sequences in bioinformatics.
