\begin{abstract}
Sampling-based planning algorithm is a powerful tool for solving planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. 
In this article, we present a novel approach to sampling in the most promising regions, which significantly reduces planning time-consumption.
The RRT\# algorithm defines the Relevant Region based on the cost-to-come provided by the optimal forward-searching tree. 
However, it uses the cumulative cost of a direct connection between the current state and the goal state as the cost-to-go.
To improve the path planning efficiency, we propose a batch sampling method that samples in a refined Relevant Region with a direct sampling strategy, which is defined according to the optimal cost-to-come and the adaptive cost-to-go, taking advantage of various sources of heuristic information.
% With our proposed method, the algorithm can generate new samples in the Relevant Region with a direct sampling method that takes advantage of various sources of heuristic information.
The proposed sampling approach allows the algorithm to build the search tree in the direction of the most promising area, resulting in a superior initial solution quality and reducing the overall computation time compared to related work.
To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted several simulations in both $SE(2)$ and $SE(3)$ state spaces.
And the simulation results demonstrate the superiorities of proposed algorithm.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we suggest improving planning efficiency with a novel sampling strategy. This strategy relies on the optimal cost-to-come and problem-specific cost-to-go heuristics, acquired through the global replanning function and the lazy-reverse searching method, respectively. This sampling strategy generates samples in the Relevant Region to guide the planner to search the most promising regions, improving the quality of the initial solution path and the convergence rate. Simulation results in $SE(2)$ and $SE(3)$ spaces demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance when solving the planning problem. In the future, we aim to take advantage of the reverse searching method to further accelerate planning efficiency.
