\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework that leverages the mirror reflection to reconstruct accurate 3D human pose. We collect a large-scale Internet dataset named Mirrored-Human with our reconstructed 3D poses as pseudo ground-truth and show that training on this dataset can enhance the performance of existing 3D human pose estimators. Our work opens many new directions for future research. We plan to extend the method to handle multiple mirrors, multiple people, multiple frames and more detailed reconstruction of shape and appearance.
