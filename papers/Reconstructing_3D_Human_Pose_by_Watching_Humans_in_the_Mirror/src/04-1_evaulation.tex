\subsection{Dataset for evaluation}
Since no dataset exists for our task which contains both mirrors and labeled 3D human keypoints, we collect a new dataset with six calibrated HD cameras, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mv_mirror}. All videos are recorded with a resolution of 1920$\times$1080 pixels at 30 fps. 
Each person is performing various actions in front of a large mirror. A calibration board is placed on the mirror, thus the mirror geometry can be easily determined, which can also be used to evaluate the estimated mirror geometry. Note that the ground-truth of 3D keypoints is generated from all views.
2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints, and the correspondences between multiple people are annotated manually.

\subsection{Reconstruction evaluation and ablation study}
\label{sec:mv-mirror}

The 3D keypoints generated by this multi-view system are used as ground-truth to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy. Metrics include MPJPE, PA-MPJPE, and MRPE. MPJPE is the distance (mm) between predicted and ground-truth 3D keypoints after root alignment. PA-MPJPE is calculated with further Procrustes alignment. MRPE is defined as the distance (mm) between the predicted and the ground-truth root joint, which evaluates the absolute root position accuracy.

\paragraph{Pose Reconstruction:} 
Two previous methods are compared here. SMPLify-X~\cite{SMPL-X:2019} is the state-of-the-art optimization-based method and SPIN~\cite{kolotouros2019spin} is the state-of-the-art regression-based method. `Baseline' combines the two methods by using \cite{kolotouros2019spin} as initialization and \cite{SMPL-X:2019} as optimization. In Table~\ref{tab:ablation}, comparing `Ours (full)' with first three rows, the result shows that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin. 

The ablation study is performed to show the effect of our mirror-induced constraints. It can be observed in Table~\ref{tab:ablation} that without the mirror normal constraint (`Ours (w/o $L_{n}$)'), our method can still perform well, indicating our applicability in the case where vanishing points are hard to acquire. If $L_{s}$ is also discarded (`Ours (w/o $L_{s}$, $L_{n}$)'), MPJPE will degrade severely while PA-MPJPE has a relatively slight change, reflecting that the mirror symmetry constraint can adjust the human orientation effectively. `Ours (w/o $L_{s}$, $L_{n}$)' is better than the baseline since $\bm \theta$ and $\bm \beta$ are shared. For MRPE, more constraints will bring the better improvement and the position error of our full model is less than 10cm. 

We also measure the accuracy of mirror normal estimation. As we have stated, the ground-truth mirror normal comes from calibration. We use the average angle between the ground-truth and the estimated normal. The angle is 1.9$^\circ$ with the ground-truth focal length, and 4.1$^\circ$ with the estimated focal length, both of which are quite small.

\paragraph{Focal length estimation:} To evaluate the accuracy of focal length estimation, we simulate the case in which only the focal length is unknown and two orthogonal vanishing points are used. One vanishing point is computed by the lines parallel to the mirror and the other is from two ways: 1) if we label two lines that are perpendicular to the mirror from the scene, the error of focal length is 4.9\% of the true value, and 2) if we make use of 2D human keypoints, the error reduces to 3.6\%. It means that the 2D human keypoints provide reliable correspondences that are helpful to estimate the focal length.

To evaluate the influence of the predicted focal length on pose estimation, we modify the focal length to different values and calculate the reconstruction accuracy. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:focal}, when the focal length deviates from the ground-truth by less than 10\%, the change of the reconstruction error is less than 5\%, showing the stability of our algorithm.

\subsection{Qualitative comparison}
Some representative results are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}, showing that our method can reconstruct accurate 3D human meshes as well as the mirror geometry. 
Compared with the monocular human mesh recovery algorithms~\cite{SMPL-X:2019, kolotouros2019spin}, our method produces much more consistent positions and orientations  (Fig.~\ref{fig:results}) and more accurate poses (Fig.~\ref{fig:comparisonpose}). More qualitative results can be found in the supplementary material.
