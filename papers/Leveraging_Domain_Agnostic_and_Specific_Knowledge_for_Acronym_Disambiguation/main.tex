\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
An obstacle to scientific document understanding is the extensive use of acronyms which are shortened forms of long technical phrases. Acronym disambiguation aims to find the correct meaning of an ambiguous acronym in a given text. Recent efforts attempted to incorporate word embeddings and deep learning architectures, and achieved significant effects in this task.
In general domains, kinds of fine-grained pretrained language models
have sprung up, thanks to the large-scale corpora which can usually be obtained through crowd-sourcing.
However, these models based on domain agnostic knowledge might achieve insufficient performance when directly applied to the scientific domain. Moreover, obtaining large-scale high-quality annotated data and representing high-level semantics in the scientific domain is challenging and expensive.
In this paper, we consider both the domain agnostic and specific knowledge, and propose a \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{D}ual-path \underline{BERT} method coined \textbf{hdBERT} to capture the general fine-grained and high-level specific representations for acronym disambiguation. First, the context-based pretrained models, RoBERTa and SciBERT, are elaborately involved in encoding these two kinds of knowledge respectively. Second, multiple layer perceptron is devised to integrate the dual-path representations simultaneously and outputs the prediction. With a widely adopted SciAD dataset contained 62,441 sentences, we investigate the effectiveness of hdBERT. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods among various evaluation metrics. Specifically, its macro F1 achieves 93.73\%.



%As acronyms  might  be  defined  either  locally  in  the  same document or globally in an external dictionary with multiple meanings, a successful document understanding model should  both capture local  definitions  and disambiguate acronyms which are not defined in documents. 

%Acronyms are short forms of phrases that help to convey lengthy sentences in documents.
%And as one of the subjects of writing. Because of their importance, please identify abbreviations and It is very important to understand the text to find the correct meaning of each phrase and find the initial abbreviation (namely, the ambiguity elimination of the initial abbreviation (AD)). 
%In this article, our task is to find out the correct meaning of the ambiguous acronym in a given sentence. That is to say, given a sentence with an ambiguous acronym and a dictionary with a possible extension (I .e., long form) of the acronym, we need to determine the true meaning of the acronym as correctly as possible. 
%In the final online evaluation in the Acronym Disambiguation task of AAAI-21 scientific document understanding competition~\footnote{\url{https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26611}}, the \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{p}ath \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{BERT}~(DPHBERT) we proposed achieved excellent results. 
%For this task, we are provided with the training and development datasets consisting of 62,441 sentences and a dictionary of 732 ambiguous acronyms. 
%The dataset and dictionary are created from 6,786 English scientific papers published at arXiv. 
%With the a series of experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of the DPHBERT, which can extract the meaning of the target abbreviation from the word level to the byte level, and finally provide a more appropriate explanation on the AD task.
