% The Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The significant growth in the number of WiFi-enabled devices as well as the increase in the traffic conveyed through wireless local area networks (WLANs) necessitate the adoption of new network control mechanisms. 
Specifically, dense deployment of access points, client mobility, and emerging QoS demands bring about challenges that cannot be effectively addressed by distributed mechanisms.
Recent studies show that software-defined WLANs (SDWLANs) simplify network control, improve QoS provisioning, and lower the deployment cost of new network control mechanisms. 
In this paper, we present an overview of SDWLAN architectures and provide a qualitative comparison in terms of features such as programmability and virtualization.
In addition, we classify and investigate the two important classes of centralized network control mechanisms: (i) association control (AsC) and (ii) channel assignment (ChA).
We study the basic ideas employed by these mechanisms, and in particular, we focus on the metrics utilized and the problem formulation techniques proposed.
We present a comparison of these mechanisms and identify open research problems.

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Bruce Springsteen}
%Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American songwriter, singer and guitarist. He has recorded and toured with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered around his native New Jersey. His eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including eighteen Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. His most famous albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life. He has sold over 65 million albums in the U.S.

%Springsteen's lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. He has gradually become identified with progressive politics. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Eric Clapton}
%Eric Patrick Clapton (born 30 March 1945), nicknamed Slowhand, is a 19 time Grammy Award-winning English rock guitarist, singer, songwriter and composer. He is one of the most successful musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries, garnering an unprecedented three inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (The Yardbirds, Cream, and solo). Often viewed by critics and fans alike as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Clapton was ranked fourth in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the ``100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time'' and \# 53 on their list of the Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

%Although Clapton's musical style has varied throughout his career, it has always remained rooted in the blues. Clapton is credited as an innovator in several phases of his career, which have included blues-rock (with John Mayall \& the Bluesbreakers and The Yardbirds) and psychedelic rock (with Cream). Clapton has also achieved great chart success in genres ranging from Delta blues (Me and Mr. Johnson) to pop (``Change the World'') and reggae (Bob Marley's ``I Shot the Sheriff''). Clapton also achieved fame with Derek and the Dominos through the hit song ``Layla''.

%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Mayall}
%John Mayall, OBE (born 29 November 1933) is a pioneering English blues singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. His musical career spans over fifty years but the most notable episode in it occurred during the late `60s. He was the founder of John Mayall \& the Bluesbreakers and has been influential in the careers of many instrumentalists, including Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, Peter Green, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Mick Taylor, Don ``Sugarcane'' Harris, Harvey Mandel, Larry Taylor, Aynsley Dunbar, Jon Hiseman, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Andy Fraser, Johnny Almond, Jon Mark, Walter Trout and Coco Montoya.
