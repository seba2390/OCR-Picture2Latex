\title{On the zeros of the spectrogram of

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In a recent paper, \cite{Fla15} has proposed filtering based on the zeros of a
spectrogram, using the short-time Fourier transform and a Gaussian window. His
results are based on empirical observations on the distribution of the zeros of
the spectrogram of white Gaussian noise. These zeros tend to be uniformly spread over the
time-frequency plane, and not to clutter. Our contributions are threefold:
we rigorously define the zeros of the spectrogram of continuous white Gaussian noise, we
explicitly characterize their statistical distribution, and we investigate the
computational and statistical underpinnings of the practical implementation of
signal detection based on the statistics of spectrogram zeros. In
particular, we stress that the zeros of spectrograms of white Gaussian noise
correspond to zeros of Gaussian analytic functions, a topic of recent
independent mathematical interest \citep{HKPV09}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}
Spectrograms are a cornerstone of time-frequency analysis \citep{Fla98}. They are quadratic time-frequency representations of a
signal \cite[Chapter 4]{Gro01}, associating to each time and frequency a real
number that measures the energy content of a signal at that time and frequency, unlike global-in-time tools such as the Fourier
transform. Since it is natural to expect that there is more energy where there
is more information or signal, most methodologies have focused on detecting and
processing the local maxima of the spectrogram \citep{Coh95, Fla98, Gro01}. Usual techniques include \emph{ridge extraction},
e.g., to identify chirps, or \emph{reassignment} and \emph{synchrosqueezing}, to
better localize the maxima of the spectrogram before further quantitative
analysis. 

In contrast, \cite{Fla15} has recently observed that the locations of the zeros of a
spectrogram in the time-frequency plane almost completely characterize the
spectrogram, and he proposed to use the point pattern formed by the zeros in
filtering and reconstruction of signals in noise. This proposition stems from
the empirical observation that the zeros of the short-time Fourier transform of
white noise are uniformly spread over the time-frequency plane, and tend not to
clutter, as if they repelled each other. In the presence of a signal, zeros are
absent in the time-frequency support of the signal, thus creating large holes
that appear to be very rare when observing pure white noise. This leads to testing
the presence of signal by looking at statistics of the point pattern of zeros,
and trying to identify holes. In this paper, we attempt a formalization of the
approach of \cite{Fla15}. To this purpose, we put together notions of signal
processing, complex analysis, probability, and spatial statistics.

Our contributions are threefold: we rigorously define the zeros of the
spectrogram of continuous white noise, we explicitely characterize their
statistical distribution, and we investigate the computational and statistical
underpinnings of the practical implementation of signal detection. In
particular, we stress that zeros of spectrograms of white noise correspond to
zeros of Gaussian analytic functions, a topic of recent independent mathematical interest \citep{HKPV09}.

In short, our approach starts from the usual definition of white noise as a random
tempered distribution. Using a classical equivalence between the short-time
Fourier transform and the Bargmann transform, we show that the short-time
Fourier transform of white noise can be identified with a random analytic
function, so that we can give a precise meaning to the zeros of the spectrogram of white
noise. It turns out that real and complex Gaussian white noises lead to
recently studied random analytic functions, with completely characterized zeros. We
then investigate how to leverage probabilistic information on these zeros to design
statistical detection procedures. This includes linking probability and
complex analysis results to the discrete implementation of the Fourier
transform.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{s:preliminary},
we introduce the relevant notions of complex analysis, probability, and spatial
statistics. In Section~\ref{s:real}, we characterize the zeros of the short-time
Fourier transform of real white noise, while the complex and the analytical case
are treated in Section~\ref{s:complex}. In Section~\ref{s:stats}, we investigate
the relation between the previous sections and the usual discrete implementation
of the Fourier transform, and we demonstrate a detection task using the spectrogram zeros.
