%% We all agree that decentralized control is the way to go
\IEEEPARstart{I}{t is} widely accepted that
modern multi-agent systems cannot rely on centralized control architectures.
This conclusion stems from issues related to gathering
all decision making to a central node,
ranging from lack of robustness and failures proneness,
to maintenance costs,
and communication overhead.
%While such issues may be neglected for small systems,
%they represent critical bottlenecks for
Indeed, large-scale networks
have experienced a net shift
towards decentralized and distributed architectures~\cite{JOVANOVIC201676,8340193}.
Moreover, the recent deployment of powerful communication protocols for massive networks,
\eg 5G~\cite{BIRAL20151,li20185g},
and advances in embedded electronics~\cite{8600375,nvidia},
as well as in algorithms for low-power devices (\eg TinyML~\cite{warden2019tinyml}),
which allow to spread computational tasks across network nodes
according to edge- and fog-computing paradigms~\cite{shi2020joint,shi2016edge,yi2015survey},
are making such networked systems grow at unprecedented scale,
further stressing the importance of distributed controller architectures.

%% Latency sucks but we cannot help it much
A challenging issue in large-scale wireless network systems is
the latency arising from channel constraints, such as
limited bandwidth or packet retransmissions.
%, on the one hand,
%and from limited computational resources at the agents, on the other hand.
To address this problem,
research efforts have been moving towards two main directions.
