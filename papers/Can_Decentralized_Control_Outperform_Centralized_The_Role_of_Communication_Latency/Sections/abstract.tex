	In this paper,
	we \tcb{examine the influence} of 
	communication latency on
	\tcb{performance} of networked control systems.
	\tcb{Even though} \review{distributed} \tcb{control} architectures \tcb{offer
		advantages in terms of communication}, maintenance costs, \tcb{and} scalability, 
	\tcb{it is an open question how communication latency
		that varies with network topology
		influences closed-loop performance}.
	\tcb{For networks in which delays increase with the number of links, we
		establish the existence of a fundamental performance trade-off that arises from 
		control architecture.
		In particular, we utilize consensus dynamics with single- and 
		double-integrator agents to show that,
		if delays increase fast enough, 
		a sparse controller with nearest neighbor interactions can outperform 
		the centralized one with all-to-all communication topology.}
