\section{\titlecap{Discrete-time agent dynamics}}\label{sec:disc-time}

\blue{We now consider discrete-time agent dynamics
to illustrate that the afore-established fundamental trade-offs hold in this case as well.}
%to address realistic communication.
%As shown in~\autoref{sec:numerical-results},
%this does not affect the fundamental \tradeoff observed for continuous-time systems.
In what follows, we denote time instants by $ \{k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}} \doteq \{kT\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}} $,
$ T $ being the sampling time.
Similarly, we re-define the delay as the number of delay steps $ \taun \doteq \ceil{\nicefrac{\taun}{T_s}} $.
