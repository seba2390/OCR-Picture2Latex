\section{\titlecap{Conclusion and future research}}\label{sec:conclusion}

{We study minimum-variance control design problem for undirected networks with both 
continuous- and discrete-time agent dynamics in the presence of communication delays.
When feedback delays increase with the number of communication links, 
we identify fundamental performance trade-offs and
show that distributed control architectures can offer superior performance to centralized ones that utilize all-to-all information exchange.
Our hope is to pave the way to a new body of research which will
enable control design with a deeper understanding of the fundamental behavior and limitations of large-scale wireless network systems.
Future work will focus on extending our results to other classes of control 
problems which include more complex system dynamics and communication models, 
more realistic information about structure of delays in a distributed scenario, 
as well as different cost functions.}
