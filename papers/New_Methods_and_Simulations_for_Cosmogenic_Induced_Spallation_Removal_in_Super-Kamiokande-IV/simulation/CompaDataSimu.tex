\section{Simulated hadronic showers}
\label{sec:simucompare}
When comparing SK-IV data to the simulations described in Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation} we neglect effects associated with muon bundles and consider only single muons traveling through the whole detector, as previously mentioned. Bundles make up to $5\%$ of the total number of muons and only one of them is expected to produce a shower; therefore for moderate-size bundles the neutron multiplicity is not expected to change. In order to accurately model muon showers and reconstruction effects in the simulation we use the following two samples:
\paragraph{Hadron producing muons:} we define hadron producing muons as muons that undergo an inelastic interaction with a nucleus in water leading to the production of two or more particles of the type: $\gamma$-rays, pions, kaons, or neutrons. These particles often initiate a cascade. These showers can be observed in about $11\%$ of the muons generated using the procedure described in Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation} and $5\%$ of them lead to the producton of isotopes contributing to backgrounds in low energy SK searches. Spallation backgrounds are hence induced by about $0.5\%$ of the muons passing through SK. For this study we generate a sample of $2.7\times 10^5$ muons, $97\%$ of which are reconstructed as single through-going muons~\footnote{The remaining $3\%$ are mostly stopping muons. A few muons are also identified as bundles with only one fitted track.}.
\paragraph{Electromagnetic only muons:} this category includes muons that either undergo only minimum ionizing interactions or induce purely electromagnetic showers. Here we generate a sample of $7.5\times 10^5$ muons. Since we do not need to model hadronic showers and isotope production, we do not use FLUKA to propagate particles in water and directly combine MUSIC with the detector simulation in the pipeline described in Sec.~\ref{sec:simulation}. The fraction of single through-going muons in the final sample is only $87\%$, as muons in this sample are typically less energetic than spallation-inducing muons and more likely to stop inside the detector.

We use the analysis procedure detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:neutspall} to extract observables characterizing the neutron cloud shapes, and the neutron multiplicity in muon-induced showers. Comparing the simulation results to the SK-IV data in pure water will allow us to estimate the systematic uncertainties associated with the neutron modeling, and motivate the use of a similar simulation to optimize spallation cuts for the current SK-Gd phase~\cite{SK-Gdloading}.
