\begin{abstract}
Disaggregated memory leverages recent technology advances in high-density, byte-addressable non-volatile memory and high-performance interconnects to provide a large memory pool shared across multiple compute nodes. 
Due to higher memory density, memory errors may become more frequent. 
Unfortunately, tolerating memory errors through existing memory-error protection techniques becomes impractical due to increasing storage cost. 
This work proposes replication-aware memory-error protection to improve storage efficiency of protection in data-centric applications that already rely on memory replication for performance and availability.
It lets such applications lower protection storage cost by weakening the protection of each individual replica, but still realize a strong protection target by relying on the collective protection conferred by multiple replicas.
