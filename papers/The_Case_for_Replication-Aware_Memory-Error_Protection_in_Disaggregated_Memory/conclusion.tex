\section{Conclusion}
We presented \ramp, our early work on efficiently tolerating memory errors in disaggregated memory systems based on high-density NVM.
\ramp gives applications (that employ replication for availability and performance) the flexibility to relax the protection strength of memory protection.
Our preliminary results show that such flexibility can bring notable savings in storage cost without sacrificing overall protection.
%We are in the process of implementing a RAMP prototype to further study memory protection and replication in real applications.
