\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\app\ integrates a shared online trend aggregation execution strategy with a dynamic sharing optimizer to maximize the benefit of sharing. 
It monitors fluctuating streams, recomputes the sharing benefit, and switches between shared and non-shared execution at runtime. 
Our experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains of \app\ compared to state-of-the-art.
