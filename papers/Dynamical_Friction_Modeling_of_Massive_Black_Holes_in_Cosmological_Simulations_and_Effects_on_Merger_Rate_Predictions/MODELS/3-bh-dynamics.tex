\caption{Visualization of $4\sigma_0$ density peak of the \texttt{DF\_4\_DM\_G} simulation at $z=4.0$ and $z=3.5$. The brightness corresponds to the gas density, and the warmness of the tone indicates the mass-weighted temperature of the gas. We plot the black holes (\textbf{cross}) with mass $>10^6 M_\odot$, as well as the halos (subhalos) hosting them (\textbf{red circles} correspond to central halos, \textbf{orange circles} correspond to subhalos. The circle radius shows the virial radius of the halo; halos are identified by Amiga's Halo Finder(AHF)). This density peak hosts the two largest black holes in our simulations (\textbf{yellow cross}), and they are going through a merger along with the merger of their host halos between $z=4$ and $z=3$. For the black hole and merger case studies, we will use examples from the circled halos/black holes shown in this figure.}
