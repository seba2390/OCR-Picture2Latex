\caption{ The evolution of BH2 in Figure \ref{fig:halos} under different BH dynamics prescriptions. We show the distance to halo center (\textbf{top}), black hole mass (\textbf{middel}) and the $x$-component of the black hole velocity (\textbf{bottom}). Mergers are shown in vertical lines (thick dashed lines are major mergers ($q>0.3$), and thin dotted lines are minor mergers) \textbf{(a):} comparison between no-DF and DF models. DF clearly helps the black hole sink to the halo center and stay there. \textbf{(b):} Effects of DF from stars and dark matter compared with gas drag. DF has a stronger effect throughout, except that in the very early stage the drag-only model is comparable to the DF-only model. \textbf{(c)}: Comparison between the DF(fid) and DF(T15) model. In general, the DF(fid) model results in a more stable black hole motion and faster sinking, but the difference is small. \textbf{(d)}: Black hole dynamics with and without the gravitational bound check during mergers. Without the gravitational bound check, the black holes can merge while still moving with large momenta, and thereby get kicked out of the halo by the injected momentum.}

Given the variety of models we have described so far, we first study the effect of different BH dynamics models by looking at the individual black hole evolution and black hole pairs using the constrained simulations. The details of these simulations and specific dynamical models are shown in Table \ref{tab:cons}. For all the constrained simulations, we use the same initial conditions, which enables us to do a case-by-case comparison between different BH dynamical models.

For the case studies, we choose to study the growth and merger histories of the two largest black holes and a few surrounding black holes within the density peak of our simulations. The halos and black holes at the $4\sigma_0$ density peak in \texttt{DF\_4DM\_G} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:halos}. The halos and subhalos shown in circles are identified with Amiga's Halo Finder \citep[AHF,][]{Knollmann2009}. The halos are centered at the minimum-potential gas particle within the halo, and the sizes of the circles correspond to the virial radius of the halo. Throughout the paper, we will always define the halo centers by the position of the minimum-potential gas particle, and we note that the offset between the minimum-potential gas and the halo center given by AHF (found via density peaks) is always less than 1.5 ckpc$/h$. The cyan crosses are black holes with mass larger than $10^6 M_\odot/h$, and the yellow crosses are the two largest black holes in the simulation. From the plot, we can see that in the \texttt{DF\_4DM\_G} simulation, most of the black holes already reside in the center of their hosting halos at $z=4$, although we also see some cases of wandering BHs outside of the halos.
