(a)
Energy absorption evaluated by the gain of the total plasma
energy $\Delta \mathcal{E}_{\rm kin}$ as a function of the external 
field strength $B_{\rm ext}$ for the CP laser cases of $I_0 = 10^{21}$
(black), 10$^{20}$ (red), 10$^{19}$ (green), and 10$^{18}$ W/cm$^2$
(blue). 
The critical field strength $B_c$ is indicated by the dotted line.
For the purpose of comparison, the results of the ion immobile runs
for $I_0 = 10^{21}$ and $10^{20}$ W/cm$^2$ are also shown by the open
squares. 
(b) 
The same figure as panel (a) for the LP laser cases.
