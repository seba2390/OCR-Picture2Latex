(Color online)
(a-c)
Parallel and perpendicular velocity diagram of electrons,
$v_{\parallel}$-$v_{\perp}$, for the fiducial model observed at (a) $t
= 0$, (b) 0.05, and (c) 0.1 ps.   
The color denotes the particle number.
The cyclotron resonance condition given by Eq. (\ref{eq:beta}) is
shown by the solid and dashed curves. 
The dotted curve denotes the upper limit of
$|\mbox{\boldmath{$v$}}| = c$.
(d)
The same figure as panel (c) for a lower intensity $I_0 = 10^{19}$
W/cm$^2$. 
%The parameters are identical to those in the fiducial model except for
%the laser intensity $I_0$.
(e) 
Energy spectrum of electrons $\epsilon f_{\epsilon} (\epsilon)$ in the
fiducial (solid) and lower 
intensity models (dashed) taken at $t = 0.05$ (red) and 0.1 ps
(black). 
The gray curve is the initial Maxwellian spectrum of $T_e = 0.05$ keV.
%Most of the curves correspond to panels (a)-(d).
The resonance condition $\gamma \gtrsim \gamma_{\rm res}$ is indicated
by the gray zone.
