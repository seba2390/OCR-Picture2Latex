(a) 
Temporal evolution of plasma kinetic energies in the fiducial model
for the electrons $\mathcal{E}_e$ (red), ions $\mathcal{E}_i$ (green),
and total $\mathcal{E}_{\rm kin} = \mathcal{E}_e + \mathcal{E}_i$ (black),
which are normalized by the incident laser energy $\mathcal{E}_0$. 
%Here, the external field strength is $B_{\rm ext} =
%50.1$ kT ($\tilde{B}_{\rm ext} = 3.74$) and the laser intensity is
%$I_0 = 10^{21}$ W/cm$^2$. 
The gray area denotes the interaction duration of the laser with the
plasma foil.  
(b,c)
Phase diagram of the position $x$ and momentum in the $x$ direction
$p_x$ for (b) the electrons and (c) ions, which are taken at the end 
of calculation $t = 1$ ps.  
The color shows the particle number.
The initial location of the target foil is from $x = 0$ to 1 $\mu$m.
