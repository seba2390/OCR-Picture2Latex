Energy spectrum of ions $\epsilon f_{\epsilon} (\epsilon)$ in the
fiducial model (black) as well as the
different $B_{\rm ext}$ runs with 20.0 kT (red) and nothing (green).
The RCP laser with $I_0 = 10^{21}$ W/cm$^2$ is used in these models, and
all the spectra are taken at $t = 1$ ps.
The gray curve is the initial Maxwellian spectrum of $T_e = 0.5$ keV.
The quiver kinetic energy of electrons $\epsilon_q$ and the
free-electron ponderomotive limit $\epsilon_p$ are indicated by arrows.
