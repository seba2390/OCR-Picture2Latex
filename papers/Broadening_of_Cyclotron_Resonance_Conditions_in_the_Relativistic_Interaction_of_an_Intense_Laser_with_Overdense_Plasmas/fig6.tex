Upper limits of the external field strength $B_{\rm ext}$ (filled
circles) for the range where the absorption rate is enhanced over a
threshold value, which are shown as a function of
the normalized intensity of the incident laser $a_0$. 
The different colors indicate different model assumptions.
The red and green marks are for the cases with the RCP and LP laser,
respectively.
The blue ones are with the RCP laser, but the ions are assumed to
be immobile.
%The pulse duration is $\tau_0 = 30$ fs for all the models,
%and the target condition is the same as in the fiducial run. 
The solid curve shows the theoretical prediction for
$\widetilde{B}_{\rm upper}$ given by Eq. (\ref{eq:bres}) assuming
$\widetilde{B}_{\rm res} = 1.7$.
The lower limits obtained numerically are also plotted by the open
squares.
