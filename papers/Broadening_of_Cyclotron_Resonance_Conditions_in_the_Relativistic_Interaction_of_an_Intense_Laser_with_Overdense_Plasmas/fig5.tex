(a) 
Energy absorption in the density and field strength diagram
constructed from the results of $50 \times 50$ simulations.  
The thickness of the hydrogen target is assumed to be 3 $\mu$m for
these calculations. 
The RCP laser is used with the intensity $I_0 = 10^{19}$
W/cm$^2$. 
The solid and dashed lines denote the R cutoff ($\tilde{n}_e =
1 - \tilde{B}_{\rm ext}$) and the cyclotron resonance ($\tilde{B}_{\rm
  ext} = 1$), respectively. 
(b)
The same figure as panel (a) for the immobile ion simulations.
