(Color online)
Trajectories of four representative electrons in the fiducial model shown
by (a) the time-energy and (b) position-energy diagrams.
The same color in the both panels means the track of an identical
particle, which is drawn form $t = 0$ [open circles in panel (b)] to 150 fs
(filled circles).
Gray areas denote (a) the duration of 30 fs when the laser pulse is hitting
the foil target and (b) the initial target location of 1 $\mu$m thickness.
As a reference, the resonance condition $\gamma = \gamma_{\rm res}$
and the quiver energy $\gamma = \gamma_q$ are depicted by the
horizontal dashed and dotted lines, respectively.
