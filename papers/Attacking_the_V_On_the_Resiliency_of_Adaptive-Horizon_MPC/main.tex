\begin{abstract}
%% The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper
%% using at least 70 and at most 150 words. It will be set in 9-point
%% font size and be inset 1.0 cm from the right and left margins.
%% There will be two blank lines before and after the Abstract. \dots
We introduce the concept of a \emph{V-formation game} between a controller and an attacker, where controller's goal is to maneuver the plant (a simple model of flocking dynamics) into a V-formation, and the goal of the attacker is to prevent the controller from doing so.  
%% The controller can attain its goal by minimizing a certain flock-wide fitness 
%% function $J$, which is (almost) zero exactly when V-formation has been reached.  
%% Conversely, the attacker seeks to maximize $J$. 
%% We formalize V-formation games in terms of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which the controller and attacker jointly determine the transition probabilities.
Controllers in V-formation games utilize a new formulation of model-predictive control we call \emph{Adaptive-Horizon MPC} (AMPC), giving them extraordinary power: we prove that under certain controllability assumptions, an AMPC controller is able to attain V-formation with probability~1.
%% find a sequence of control actions (flock-wide accelerations) that brings the MDP to %% a V-formation goal state with probability one.

We define several classes of attackers, including those that in one move can remove
%%  a small number 
$R$ birds from the flock, or introduce random displacement
%% (perturbation)
into flock dynamics. 
%%again by selecting a small number of victim agents.  
We consider both \emph{naive attackers}, whose strategies are purely probabilistic, and \emph{AMPC-enabled attackers}, putting them on par strategically with the controllers.
%% in V-formation games.
While an AMPC-enabled controller is expected to win every game with probability~1, in practice, it is \emph{resource-constrained}: its maximum prediction horizon and the maximum number of game execution steps are fixed.  Under these conditions, an attacker has a much better chance of winning a V-formation game.

Our extensive performance evaluation of V-formation games uses statistical model checking to estimate the probability
%% by which 
an attacker can thwart the controller.  Our results show that for the bird-removal game with $R\,{=}\,1$, the controller almost always wins (restores the flock to a V-formation). For $R\,{=}\,2$, the game outcome critically depends on which two birds are removed.
%% : as long as the two removed birds are not adjacent to one another, the controller 
%% wins (is resilient).  
For the displacement game, our results again demonstrate that an intelligent attacker, i.e.~one that uses AMPC in this case, significantly outperforms its naive counterpart
%% that simply and uniformly at random
that randomly executes its attack.
