\textit{I dedicate this work to all those who one day, saw the efforts they had put into a project (especially an intense love relationship) being wiped out without a logical explanation and who took it upon themselves, to ride the waves unleashed by these storms, came out ten times stronger and developed an incredible desire to live rather than die. Like your daily efforts, this work is in large part the result of the knowledge that suffering has brought to me and thus, it contributes to prove Friedrich Nietzsche's aphorism: "\textbf{what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger}".}
