\myChapterStar{Acknowledgements}{}{section}
Along the paths I followed during this thesis, I have gained a unique experience and, I hope, the necessary maturity to aspire to the title of Doctor/PhD. Throughout these years of work, I have come to realise that producing a thesis is far from being a solitary labour. In order to go through this tunnel, one must be under the benevolent escort of the Almighty Lord and of souls of good faith. I have benefited from a multiform accompaniment of many persons, both physical and moral. I would like them to find in this section, the expression of my deep gratitude. I therefore thank very warmly:

~

\noindent- The \textsc{LORD} \textit{our God, creator of heaven and earth}: in addition to my days, he offers me every day, the necessary grace and strength to continue to glorify him. Glory be to you, Holy Father!

~

\noindent- Dr \textsc{TCHOUP{\'E} TCHENDJI Maurice}, \textit{Senior Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Faculty of Science of the University of Dschang}: he took the time to mentor me throughout this work, inculcating in me his sense of commitment and organisation. Sir, I reiterate that you are my model.

~

\noindent- Pr \textsc{TAYOU DJAMEGNI Cl{\'e}mentin}, \textit{Head of the Computer Engineering Department of the Institute of Technology - Fotso Victor of Bandjoun}: it was under difficult conditions that he agreed to supervise this work and to reward us with his legendary positivism. I'm more than honoured to be one of your students, Sir.

~

\noindent- All the imminent members of my pre-hearing and defence juries: they agreed to objectively evaluate this work. Thank you for the chance you are giving me, gentlemen.

~

\noindent- Dr \textsc{PARIGOT Didier}, \textit{Senior Researcher on Programming Languages at INRIA}: he accompanied me during this thesis by his reviews, his points of view, his recommendations and his know-how in terms of software programming. I learned a lot from your multiple contributions, Sir.

~

\noindent- The \textit{INRIA/LIRIMA FUCHSIA Associate Research Team}: they welcomed me when I needed it most and gave me a chance to express myself. Working with you guys is a lifelong dream.

~

\noindent- The \textit{lecturers at the University of Dschang}: they contributed enormously to my education. As education is priceless, I can only express my gratitude.

~

\noindent- My \textit{parents}, \textsc{NDADJI Emmanuel} and \textsc{MAFFOZEMTSOP Marie}: they gave me everything. I love you infinitely.

~

\noindent- My \textit{brothers, sisters, friends and colleagues (Nani, Chance, Alex, Arnold, Brice, Ari\`ege, Brel, Doris, Audrey, Fabrice, Rodrigue, Virginie, Emeric, Nestor, Preston, Yann, Max, Ange, Lionel, etc.)}: I live only by you and for you (uh, for me too ;-)).

~

\noindent- My dear \textsc{BANGUKET T. Nina}: she proofread and corrected the typos in all my English documents. Now I can write a correct sentence in English, thanks to you.
