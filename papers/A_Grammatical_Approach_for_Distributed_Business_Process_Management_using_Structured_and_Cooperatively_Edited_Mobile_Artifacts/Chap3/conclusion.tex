\label{chap3:sec:conclusion}
In this chapter, we have proposed a new approach to facilitate workflow design and their execution in a distributed environment. The approach relies on the cooperative editing of a mobile artifact by several agents.
The design of artifacts and their type (artifact type), the architecture and management protocols (choreography) of agents have been presented and discussed. Likewise, an illustration and an experimentation of the whole approach on a real example of an administrative business process (the peer-review process) were presented.

The proposed approach has many advantages, which we have outlined. In particular, it covers all aspects of process automation using BPM technology. 
In addition to the formal and demonstrative presentations, we have conducted a preliminary discussion of the presented approach in relation to existing work, and finally concluded that we have achieved the objective of this thesis.
