For a pair $(G,G')=(O(n+1,1), O(n,1))$
 of reductive groups, 
 we investigate intertwining operators ({\textit{symmetry breaking operators}})  between principal series representations
 $I_\delta(V,\lambda )$ of $G$, 
 and $J_\varepsilon(W,\nu)$ of the subgroup $G'$.  
The representations are parametrized by finite-dimensional representations $V$,  $W$ of $O(n)$ respectively of $O(n-1)$,
 characters $\delta$, $\varepsilon$ of $O(1)$, 
 and $\lambda, \ \nu \in {\mathbb C}$. 
Denote by $[V:W]$  the multiplicity of $W$ 
 occurring in the restriction $V|_{O(n-1)}$, 
 which is either 0 or 1.  
If $[V:W] \ne 0$
 then 
 we construct a holomorphic family of symmetry breaking operators
 and prove that 
$
   \dim_{\mathbb{C}} \operatorname{Hom}_{G'}(I_{\delta}(V, \lambda)|_{G'}, J_{\varepsilon}(W, \nu))
$
 is nonzero
 for all the parameters $\lambda$, $\nu$ and $\delta$, $\varepsilon$, 
 whereas if $[V:W] = 0$ there may exist {\textit{sporadic}} differential symmetry breaking operators. 

We propose a {\textit{classification scheme}} to find all matrix-valued symmetry breaking operators explicitly,
and carry out this program completely in the case
 $ (V,W)=(\bigwedge^i({\mathbb{C}}^{n}), \bigwedge^j({\mathbb{C}}^{n-1}))$.  
In conformal geometry, our results yield the complete classification
of conformal covariant operators from differential forms on a Riemannian manifold $X$
to those on a submanifold $Y$ in the model space $(X, Y) = (S^n, S^{n-1})$.


We use this information to determine the space of symmetry breaking operators 
 for any pair of irreducible representations
 of $G$ and the subgroup $G'$  with trivial infinitesimal character.  
Furthermore we prove the multiplicity conjecture by B.~Gross and D.~Prasad for  tempered principal series representations of $(SO(n+1,1), SO(n,1))$ 
 and also for 3 tempered representations $\Pi, \pi, \varpi$ of 
$SO(2m+2,1)$, $SO(2m+1,1)$ and $SO(2m,1)$
 with trivial infinitesimal character.
In connection to automorphic form theory,
 we apply our main results to find {\textit{periods}}
 of irreducible representations of the Lorentz group 
having nonzero $({\mathfrak{g}}, K)$-cohomologies.  



This book is an extension of the recent work in the two research monographs:
Kobayashi--Speh [Memoirs Amer.~Math.~Soc., 2015]
for {\textit{spherical}} principal series representations 
and
Kobayashi--Kubo--Pevzner [Lecture Notes in Math., 2016]
for conformally covariant {\textit{differential}} symmetry breaking operators.
