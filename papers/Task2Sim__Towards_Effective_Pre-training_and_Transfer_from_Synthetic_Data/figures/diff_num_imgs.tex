    \caption{Task2Sim performance (avg over 12 seen tasks) vs other methods at different number of images for pretraining. Task2Sim is highly effective at fewer images. Increasing the number of images improves performance for all methods, reaching a saturation at a high enough number. See \cref{subsec:analysis} for more discussion.}
