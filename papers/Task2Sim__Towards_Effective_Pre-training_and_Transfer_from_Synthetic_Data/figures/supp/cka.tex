    \caption{CKA similarities between features from backbones trained on different pre-training datasets (with 100k images from 237 classes). Similarities have been computed using features output at different stages of the Resnet-50 model. We notice that features at earlier stages across all methods of pre-training are quite similar and only later in the Resnet, do they start differentiating. We also observe that Task2Sim's features are more similar to Imagenet than those produced by pre-training with Domain Randomization.}
