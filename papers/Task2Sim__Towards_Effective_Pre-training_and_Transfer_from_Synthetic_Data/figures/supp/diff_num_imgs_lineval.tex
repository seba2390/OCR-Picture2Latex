    \caption{Task2Sim performance (avg over 12 seen tasks) vs other methods using linear probing for evaluation at different number of images for pretraining. Task2Sim is highly effective at fewer images. Increasing the number of images improves performance for all methods. Towards higher number of images in the case of linear probing we see methods not only reach a saturation but also exhibit some overfitting to pre-training data. Also, Domain Randomization stops improving in this case (evaluation with linear probing) before it can match Task2Sim performance.}
