    \caption{\small \textbf{Illustration of our proposed approach}. Given a batch of tasks represented by Task2Vec representations, our approach (\ours) aims to map these representations to optimal simulation parameters for generating a dataset of synthetic images. The downstream classifier’s accuracy for the set of tasks is then used as a reward to update \ours's parameters. Once trained, \ours can be used not only for “seen” tasks but also can be used in one-shot to generate simulation parameters for novel “unseen” tasks.}
