    \caption{3 nearest neighbors of three test examples from the CUB dataset based on different pretrained feature representations (top: Task2Sim, middle: domain randomization, bottom: ImageNet*). Neighbors with a blue box share the same class with the anchor image on the left. For Task2Sim, similar to Imagenet, the neighbors are of similar color which suggests that the pretrained representation captures color similarity which can be crucial for identifying different bird species. Best viewed in color.}
