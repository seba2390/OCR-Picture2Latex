In sec.~\ref{subsec:accuracy}, we describe the experimental setup, assess the classification performance of the CoDA-Nets and discuss their efficiency.
Further, in sec.~\ref{subsec:intp_results} we evaluate the model-inherent contribution maps derived from $\mat w_{0\rightarrow L}$ (cf.~eq.~\eqref{eq:contrib}) and compare them both \emph{qualitatively} (Fig.~\ref{fig:quality}) as well as \emph{quantitatively} (Fig.~\ref{fig:localisation}) to other attribution methods.
