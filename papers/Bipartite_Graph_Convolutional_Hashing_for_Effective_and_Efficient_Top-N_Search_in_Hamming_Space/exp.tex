\section{\textbf{Experimental Evaluation}}
\label{sec:exp}
We evaluate \model~to answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{RQ1.} How does \model~perform compared to state-of-the-art hashing-based models in the Top-N Hamming space retrieval?

\item \textbf{RQ2.} what is the performance gap between \model~ and the full-precision models in terms of long-list retrieval quality?

\item \textbf{RQ3.} What are the benefits of proposed components in \model?

\item \textbf{RQ4.} what is the practical \model~resource consumption?

\item \textbf{RQ5.} How does the Fourier Series decomposition perform \textit{w.r.t.} retrieval accuracy and training efficiency?

% \item \textbf{RQ6.} How do different hyper-parameter settings affect \model?
\end{itemize}
