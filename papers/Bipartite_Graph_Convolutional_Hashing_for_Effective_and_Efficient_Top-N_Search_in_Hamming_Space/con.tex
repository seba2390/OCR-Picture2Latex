\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}
\label{sec:con}
We study the graph convolutional hashing over bipartite graphs for efficient Hamming space search, by proposing \model~with three effectual modules.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the model superiority over conventional counterparts and validate the effectiveness of all proposed modules. 
As for future work, we plan to investigate modeling with the \textit{semi-supervised} graph setting~\cite{zixing1,zixing2} mainly for its commonality in practice. 
Moreover, another promising direction is to upgrade \model~ for \textit{inductive learning}~\cite{graphsage}, such that it can make adaptive matching and prediction for evolving graphs with structural updates.



% we point out two possible directions.
% (1) Our proposed \model~ model relies on learning the graph topology for prediction. 
% However, it can not be applied to unknown graph nodes so far.
% Thus, a promising direction is to upgrade \model~ for \textit{inductive learning}, such that it can make matching and prediction for new nodes that have never appeared before.
% (2) It is also worth developing other hashing functions with similarity-preserving and differentiable derivatives for effective hash code learning.
