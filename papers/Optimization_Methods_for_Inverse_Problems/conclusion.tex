\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The state-of-the-art optimization methods used in the inverse problem community
do not yet cope with some challenges, such as large-scale problems,
nonconvexity, very well.
At the same time, many progresses in optimization have been made in the machine
learning community.
While our discussion on the connections are nevertheless brief, we hope it has
pointed out some interesting avenues that the two communities can learn from
each other and work together.
