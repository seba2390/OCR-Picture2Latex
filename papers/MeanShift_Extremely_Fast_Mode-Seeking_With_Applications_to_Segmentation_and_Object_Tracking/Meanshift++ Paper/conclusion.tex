\section{Conclusion}

We provided MeanShift++, a simple and principled approach to speed up the MeanShift algorithm in low-dimensional settings. We applied it to clustering, image segmentation, and object tracking, and show that MeanShift++ is competitive with MeanShift in low dimensions while being as much as 10,000x faster. This dramatic speedup makes MeanShift++ practical for modern computer vision applications.
