\section{Conclusion}

We present a systemization of knowledge for secure computing technologies and highlight opportunities for cross-stack software-hardware-security codesign.
For each technology, we identify the codesign considerations across software, hardware, and security, and expose the design feedback considerations that mandate co-optimization across each to guide efficient system design and integration.
Insights into both emerging technologies as well as historical precedence can both guide and motivate the same codesign opportunities for future technologies.
By recognizing the need for co-optimizing secure computing solutions in both historical and modern secure computing techniques, we hope these will inform more systematic and efficient deployments in the future.
