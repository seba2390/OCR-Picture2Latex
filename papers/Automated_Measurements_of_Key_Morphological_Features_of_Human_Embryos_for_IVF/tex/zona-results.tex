\boldparagraph{Zona Pellucida Segmentation} Our zona pellucida network nearly optimally segments the test set images, taken from 36 embryos at 576 times. The FCN correctly labels image pixels 96.7\% of the time, with per-class accuracies between 93-99\% (Figure~\ref{fig:zona}, right). The misclassified pixels arise mostly at region boundaries, roughly corresponding to the few-pixel human labeling inprecision at region boundaries.
