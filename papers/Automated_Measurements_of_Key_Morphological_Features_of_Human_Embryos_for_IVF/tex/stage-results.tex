\boldparagraph{Stage Classification} The stage classifier predicts the developmental stage with a 87.9\% accuracy on the test set, consisting of 73 embryos labeled at 23,850 times (Figure~\ref{fig:stage}, right). The network's accuracy is high but lower than the human labeling accuracy on the test set (94.6\%). The network outperforms a baseline ResNeXt101 by 6.7\%; both the soft-loss and the dynamic programming each improve the predictions by 2\% (Table~\ref{table:ablation}). The stage classifier struggles when there are between 5 and 8 cells (66.9\% accuracy for these classes). In contrast, the stage classifier does exceedingly well on images with 1-cell (99.9\%), 2-cells (98.7\%), empty wells (99.4\%), or blastocysts (98.0\%; Figure~\ref{fig:stage}, right). Despite measuring significantly more developmental stages, our stage classifier outperforms previous cell counting networks developed for human embryos~\cite{khan2016deep,lau2019embryo}.
