We train the CNNs using data from the \Embryoscope{}, the most widely-used system for IVF with standardized, time-lapse microscopy~\cite{dolinko2017national}. \Embryoscope{} images are grayscale, and taken using Hoffman Modulation Contrast microscopy~\cite{hoffman1975modulation}, in which the intensity roughly corresponds to refractive index gradients. In our dataset, the \Embryoscope{} takes an image every 20 minutes at 7 focal planes, usually at 15~\micron{} increments. The recorded images provide views of the embryo with different amounts of defocus; they do not provide 3D information. The embryos are recorded for 3 -- 5 days, corresponding to 200 -- 350 images at each focal plane (\textit{i.e.}, 1400 -- 2450 images per embryo), although embryos are occasionally removed from the incubation system for clinical procedures. To train the CNNs, we curate a dataset with detailed, frame-by-frame labels for each task.
