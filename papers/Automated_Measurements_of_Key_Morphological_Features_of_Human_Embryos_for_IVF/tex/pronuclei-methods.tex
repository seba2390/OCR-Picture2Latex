\boldparagraph{Pronucleus Object Instance Segmentation} Finally, in the images identified as 1-cell by the stage classifier, we detect the presence of pronuclei. To do so, we train another object instance segmentation network with the Mask R-CNN architecture~\cite{he2017mask} and a ResNet50 backbone~\cite{he2016deep}. We use a training set of 151 embryos labeled at 9,250 times during the 1-cell stage, with a validation set of 33 embryos labeled at 1,982 times for early stopping~\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. Pronuclei are only visible during a portion of the 1-cell stage; correspondingly, about 38\% of the training images contain 0, 6\% contain 1, and 54\% contain 2 pronuclei. The pronuclei detector takes as input a single image, cropped from the zona pellucida segmentation and resized to 500$\times$500, and it predicts a bounding box, mask, and confidence score for each detected candidate (Figure~\ref{fig:pronuclei}, left). We run the pronuclei detector on the three middle focal planes and merge candidates by using the one with the highest confidence score.
