\boldparagraph{Zona Pellucida Segmentation} We first perform semantic segmentation to identify regions of the embryo, segmenting the image into four regions: pixels outside the well, inside the well, the zona pellucida, and the space inside the zona pellucida (the perivitelline space and embryo; Figure~\ref{fig:zona}, left). We segment the images by using a fully-convolutional network (FCN~\cite{long2015fully}; based on Resnet101~\cite{he2016deep}) to predict a per-pixel class probability for each pixel in the image. We train the FCN with images chosen from 203 embryos at 3,618 time points; we use neither a separate validation set nor early stopping for the zona segmentation.

The zona pellucida segmentation network in our pipeline takes the full 500$\times$500 pixel image as input. We use the segmentation result to crop the images to 328$\times$328, centered around the embryo, as input for the other networks.
