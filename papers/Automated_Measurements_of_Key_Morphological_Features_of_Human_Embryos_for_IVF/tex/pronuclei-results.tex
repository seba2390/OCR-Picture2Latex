\boldparagraph{Pronucleus Object Instance Segmentation} The pronuclei segmentation network predicts masks with a mAP of 0.680 on the test set of 33 embryos labeled at 2,090 times. The network identifies pronuclei with a precision of 81.4\% and a recall of 88.2\%. Much of the false positive detections are from vacuoles inside the 1-cell embryo, which look similar to pronuclei. For correctly-identified candidates, the predicted pronuclei area is within 16\% of the true pronuclei area 90\% of the time (Figure~\ref{fig:pronuclei}, right). The pronuclei network's mAP outperforms that of a baseline Mask-RCNN by 0.03; averaging across focal planes and cropping to a region-of-interest each improves the mAP by 0.01 (Table~\ref{table:ablation}).
