Our unified pipeline greatly speeds up the measurement of embryos: running all five networks on a 300-image, five-day movie takes 6 minutes on a GTX Titan X. In the future, we plan to make this pipeline even faster by combining all five networks with multi-task learning~\cite{dai2016instance}. Since we measure many of the key morphological features used in clinical IVF, our unified pipeline has the potential to reduce the time to grade embryos without sacrificing interpretability. Equally as important, the automatic, high-quality data produced by our pipeline will enable better retrospective chart studies for IVF, improving IVF by informing better clinical practice.
