\boldparagraph{Cell Object Instance Segmentation} We measure the accuracy of the cell instance segmentation network using mean-average precision (mAP)~\cite{lin2014microsoft}, a standard metric for object instance segmentation tasks. Our network predicts cell masks with a mAP of 0.737 on the test set, consisting of 31 embryos labeled at 4,953 times. The model identifies cells with a precision of 82.8\% and a recall of 88.4\%, similar to results from other work on fewer images~\cite{rad2018hybrid}. For correctly-identified candidates, the predicted cell area is within 17\% of the true cell area 90\% of the time (Figure~\ref{fig:contour}, right); much of this error arises when cells strongly overlap late in the cleavage stage. Cropping to a region-of-interest provides a marginal improvement to the network's accuracy (Table~\ref{table:ablation}).
