\boldparagraph{Cell Object Instance Segmentation} For the images identified by the stage classifier as having 1--8 cells, we next perform object instance segmentation on each cell in the image. We train a network with the Mask R-CNN architecture~\cite{he2017mask} and a ResNet50 backbone~\cite{he2016deep}, using 102 embryos labeled at 16,284 times with 8 or fewer cells; we also use a validation set of 31 embryos labeled at 4,487 times for early stopping~\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. Our instance segmentation model takes as input a single-focus image cropped from the zona segmentation and resized to 500$\times$500. The segmentation model then predicts a bounding box, mask, and confidence score for each detected cell candidate (Figure~\ref{fig:contour}, left). Both the ground-truth labels and the predicted masks overlap significantly when the embryo has 2--8 cells (Figure~\ref{fig:contour}, center). We produce a final prediction by running our segmentation model on the three central focal planes; we merge candidates found across focal planes by using the one with the highest confidence score.
