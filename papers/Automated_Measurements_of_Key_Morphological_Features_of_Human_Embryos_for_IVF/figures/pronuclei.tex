\caption{
    The pronuclei detection network (Mask-RCNN, ResNet50 backbone) takes an
    image (left) and proposes candidates as a combined object mask and
    confidence score from 0--1 (second from left). Center: The boundaries of
    the object mask represented as the pronuclei contours (magenta, center).
    Second from right: 12 pronuclei instance segmentations for 4 embryos from
    the test set (shown as magenta contours overlaid on the original
    image); the rightmost images illustrate true negatives after the
    pronuclei have faded. Right: Histogram of the ratio of predicted to
    true areas for correctly identified pronuclei in the test set.
