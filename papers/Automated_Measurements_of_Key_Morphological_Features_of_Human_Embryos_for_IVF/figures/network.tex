\caption{
    Instead of performing one task, our unified pipeline extracts
    multiple features from embryos. We first segment the image to locate
    the embryo (panel~a), colored according to segmentation. The
    segmentation provides a region-of-interest (ROI, white box) for the
    other 4 networks, starting with embryo fragmentation (b); the
    image shown has a predicted fragmentation score of 0.26. If the
    embryo's fragmentation score is less than 1.5, we classify the
    developmental stage (c); this image is classified as a 2-cell
    embryo. We then detect cells in cleavage stage embryos (orange
    contours in d) and pronuclei in 1-cell embryos (magenta contours in
    e).
