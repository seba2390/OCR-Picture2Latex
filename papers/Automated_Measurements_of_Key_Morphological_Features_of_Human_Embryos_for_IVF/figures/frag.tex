    Left: The fragmentation network (InceptionV3 architecture) scores
    embryos with a real number from 0 -- 3; the image at left is scored
    as a fragmentation of 2.46. Center: 8 representative fragmentation
    scores on the test set, shown as image: score pairs.  Right: The
    distribution of the network's prediction given the ground-truth
    label on the test set. The green distribution corresponds to images
    with a ground-truth label of 0; orange those labeled as 1; blue, 2;
    pink, 3.
