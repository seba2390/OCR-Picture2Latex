    Left: The stage classification CNN (ResNeXt101) predicts a per-class
    probability for each image; the two bar plots show the predicted
    probabilities for the two images. Center: We use dynamic
    programming to find the most-likely non-decreasing trajectory
    (orange); the circled times $t_1$ and $t_2$ correspond to the
    predictions at left. Right: The distribution of predictions given
    the true labels, measured on the test set.
