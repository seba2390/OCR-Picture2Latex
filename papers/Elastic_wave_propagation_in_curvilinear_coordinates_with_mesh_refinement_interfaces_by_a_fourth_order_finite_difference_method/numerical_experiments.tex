\section{Numerical Experiments}
We present four numerical experiments. 
 In Sec.~\ref{convergence_study}, we verify the order of the convergence of the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}, \ref{fine_scheme}, \ref{continuous_sol}, \ref{continuous_traction}).  In  Sec.~\ref{iterative_section}, we present three iterative methods for solving the linear systems (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}). The efficiency of the iterative methods is investigated and a comparison with the LU-factorization method is conducted. Next, in Sec.~\ref{gaussian_source} we show that our schemes generate little reflection at the mesh refinement interface. Finally, the energy conservation property is verified in Sec.~\ref{conserved_energy} with heterogeneous and discontinuous material properties.
