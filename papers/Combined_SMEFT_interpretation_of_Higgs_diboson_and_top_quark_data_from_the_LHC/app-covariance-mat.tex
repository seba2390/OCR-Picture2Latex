\section{Correlation matrices in EFT space}
\label{sec:fullcovmat}

{ 
  In Sect.~\ref{sec:results} we have presented results for
  the correlation coefficients associated to a specific subset of operators
  that define our EFT parameter space, in particular those
  pairs exhibiting large absolute correlations, $|\rho(c_i,c_j)|\ge 0.5$.
  %
  For completeness, we display here the full correlations
  matrices in the EFT parameter space.
  %
  Fig.~\ref{fig:globalfitfull-correlations-NLO} shows the
  correlation coefficients $\rho\lp c_i,c_j\rp$
    for the complete set of EFT coefficients
    that enters the present global analysis.
    %
    We present the results corresponding to both the linear
    (left panels) and quadratic (right panels) fits,
    for the case where the EFT cross-sections include
    NLO QCD corrections (top panels) and where they do not
    (bottom panels).

    Inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:globalfitfull-correlations-NLO} confirms
    two main findings of Sect.~\ref{sec:results}
    concerning the correlation patterns of the global EFT fit.
    %
    First of all, how quadratic corrections decrease the
    correlation between fit parameters.
    %
    Second, though perhaps a less marked effect, how NLO QCD corrections
    also lead to a decrease in the absolute value
    of these correlations coefficients.
    %
    In both cases, as previously mentioned, the decrease
    in the values of $|\rho(c_i,c_j)|$ arises from
    the additional sensitivity to new directions
    in the SMEFT parameter space introduced by the quadratic
    corrections and by the NLO QCD corrections to the EFT
    hard-scattering cross-sections.
