\section{Summary and outlook}
\label{sec:summary}

In this work we have presented an extensive interpretation of Higgs, diboson, and top
quark measurements from the LHC in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory.
%
By combining the most updated  experimental data with state-of-the-art theory calculations,
both in the SM and in the EFT,
we have provided bounds on 50 directions in the SMEFT parameter space
of which 36 correspond to independent parameters.
%
We have quantified in detail
the relative impact that the different types of processes have in the results
of this global EFT analysis, both in terms of fits with dataset variations
and by means of statistical diagnosis tools such as information geometry techniques
and principal component analysis.
%
Our analysis 
highlights the overall complementarity of the various input processes,
further motivating the need
for a global interpretation of LHC measurements.
%
We have also demonstrated how, within such
a global EFT analysis, genuinely flat directions are essentially
absent since each process and each kinematic bin of a distribution
constrains separate combinations of the fit parameters.
%
The robustness  of our fitting methodology has been cross-validated by deploying
two completely independent methods, MCfit and NS, for mapping the EFT parameter space.

We have also extensively quantified the role played in the global analysis
by the inclusion of NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections,
whose automation has been recently achieved.
%
We find that the posterior probability distributions of the fit parameters
can be modified in non-trivial ways by these NLO QCD effects, shifting the best-fit
value, modifying the magnitude of the 95\% CL intervals, and even inducing multi-modal
distributions.
%
These findings demonstrate that available LHC data is already sensitive to
NLO effects in the EFT cross-sections, further highlighting the
importance of accounting for them in a systematic manner to achieve both
accurate and precise results.

One could consider several directions in which the present study could be extended.
%
To begin with, one would like to include directly the constraints provided
by LEP's electroweak precision observables, rather than in an 
approximate manner as done in the present work.
%
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to add to the global analysis new  high-$p_T$ observables
providing complementary information on the Higgs and gauge sectors of the SMEFT,
such as for instance vector boson scattering (VBS),  $Z$ production in vector boson fusion (VBF),
or high-mass Drell-Yan production, all of them constraining the electroweak interactions.
%
Other processes that one might consider in this context
are  single-inclusive jet, dijet,
and multijet production, which are sensitive to several directions
in the parameter space not covered by other processes, specifically to a large
number of four-fermion operators.

From the point of view of theoretical calculations, it would be important to systematize the study
of higher-order terms in the EFT expansion, considering in particular double insertions
of dimension-six operators and representative subsets of dimension-eight operators.
%
We point out that, within our fitting methodology, accounting for these higher order terms
is technically straightforward.
%
Along the same lines, one could extend the fitting formalism to account
for all sources of theoretical uncertainties and their correlations in a systematic
manner, both for the SM and for the EFT calculations, something which is done
only partially here.
%
In addition, it should be interesting to develop statistically optimal observables
for EFT analyses, such as those based on deep
learning~\cite{Brehmer:2018kdj,DAgnolo:2018cun,Chen:2020mev},
making possible complementing
 the constraints obtained at the level of unfolded
 cross-sections with those extracted directly at the detector level.

Another promising research direction is that of combining
the global EFT interpretation of high-$p_T$ observables
at the LHC presented here with that of flavour data from LHCb and from other $B$-factories
such as Belle.
%
The urgency of a simultaneous EFT analyses of high-$p_T$ and flavour data
has been further highlighted by the recent evidence reported by the LHCb
experiment for the violation
of lepton flavour universality (LFU) in $B$-meson decays~\cite{Aaij:2021vac}.
%
These findings demand exploiting the flexibility of the EFT framework
in order to  comprehensively map the allowed signatures of eventual LFU violation
in  high-$p_T$ cross-sections at the LHC and elsewhere.

Likewise, it would be important to account for the constraints
provided by low energy processes in the SMEFT parameter space,
from neutrino data and electric dipole moment measurements
to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.
%
In the latter case, a $4.1\sigma$ deviation
with respect to the SM expectation has recently been reported~\cite{Abi:2021gix},
confirming and strengthening one of the most puzzling anomalies in particle
physics.
%
Indeed, the ultimate goal of our program would be a truly global EFT interpretation
including all processes sensitive to the sought-for UV completion of the SM,
making sure no stone is left unturned in the ongoing quest to unravel the new particles
and interactions that lie beyond the Standard Model.
