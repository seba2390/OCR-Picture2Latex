\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We now present the main results of this work:
the determination of the best-fit values,
confidence level intervals, and posterior probability distributions
associated to the $n_{\rm op}=50$ EFT coefficients (of which 36 are independent) listed in
Table~\ref{tab:operatorbasis} from the global
interpretation of Higgs, top quark, and diboson cross-section measurements.
%
As motivated in Sect.~\ref{sec:fitsettings}, the results
shown here have been obtained with the NS approach, and we have verified that
equivalent results are obtained with the MCfit method.

First of all, we discuss the quality of the fit,
both for the total and for individual
datasets.
%
Second, we present the bounds and posterior probability distributions
for the various EFT coefficients, assess their consistency with the
SM hypothesis, and determine their pattern of cross-correlations.
%
Third, we study the dependence of our results on the choice of input dataset,
in particular with fits based only on top or Higgs data, as well as on that of the theory settings,
where the impact of the NLO QCD corrections to the EFT cross-sections is quantified.
%
Finally, we present EFT fits  in the top-philic scenario, where the parameter space
is restricted by constraints motivated by specific UV-complete models.
%
The comparison between SM and SMEFT theory predictions
with the experimental dataset used as input to
the fit is then collected in App.~\ref{sect:app_comparison_data}.
