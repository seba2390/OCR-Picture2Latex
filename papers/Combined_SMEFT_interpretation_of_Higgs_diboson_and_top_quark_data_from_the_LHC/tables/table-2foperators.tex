\caption{Same as Table~\ref{tab:oper_bos}
  for the operators containing two fermion fields, either
  quarks or leptons, as well as the four-lepton operator $\Op{\ell\ell}$.
  %
  The flavor index $i$ runs from 1 to 3.
  %
  The coefficients indicated with (*) in the second column do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom
  in the fit, but are rather replaced by  $c_{\varphi q_i}^{(-)}$, $c_{\varphi Q_i}^{(-)}$, and
  $c_{tZ}$ defined in Table~\ref{tab:oper_ferm_bos2}.
