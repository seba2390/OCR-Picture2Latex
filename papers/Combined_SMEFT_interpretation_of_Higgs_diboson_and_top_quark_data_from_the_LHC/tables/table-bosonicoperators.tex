          modify the production and decay of Higgs bosons and
          the interactions of the electroweak gauge bosons.
          %
          For each operator, we indicate its definition in terms of the SM
          fields,
          and the notational conventions that will be used
          both for the operator and for the Wilson coefficient.

          The operators $O_{\varphi WB}$ and $O_{\varphi D}$
          are severely
          constrained by the EWPOs together with several of
          the two-fermion operators from Table~\ref{tab:oper_ferm_bos}.
