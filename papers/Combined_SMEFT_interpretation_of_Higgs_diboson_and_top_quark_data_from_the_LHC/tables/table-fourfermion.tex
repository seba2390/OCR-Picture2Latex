  \caption{\small Definition of the four-fermion degrees of freedom that enter into
    the fit in terms of the coefficients of Warsaw basis operators of Eq.~(\ref{eq:FourQuarkOp}).
    %
    These DoFs are classified into four-heavy (upper) and two-light-two-heavy
    (bottom part) operators. The flavor index $i$ is either 1 or 2, 
    and $j$ is either 1, 2 or 3: with our flavor assumptions,  these coefficients will be the same
    regardless of the specific values that $i$ and $j$ take.
