\section{Usage of SMEFiT results}
\label{sec:delivery}

The results of this work are made available via
the website of the {\tt SMEFiT} project:

as well as via the corresponding public {\tt GitHub} repository:

Specifically, we provide the full set of  $N_{\rm spl}$ samples corresponding
to the NS fits presented in this work for the $n_{\rm op}=50$ Wilson coefficients.
%
We recall that not all of these coefficients are associated to independent degrees
of freedom, and that 14 of them are constrained by the EWPO relations
as discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:smefttheory}.

These $N_{\rm spl}$ samples provide a representation of the probability
density associated to the EFT coefficients.
%
From these samples, it is easy to evaluate statistical estimators such as
means, standard deviations, and correlations, e.g.,
\begin{align}
  \la c_i\ra &= \frac{1}{N_{\rm spl}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm spl}}c_i^{(k)} \, ,\quad i=1,\ldots,n_{\rm op} \, , \\
  \sigma_{c_i} &= \lp \frac{1}{N_{\rm spl}-1} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm spl}} \lp c_i^{(k)}- \la c_i\ra
  \rp^2  \rp^{1/2} \, ,\quad i=1,\ldots,n_{\rm op} \, , \\
  \rho(c_i,c_j) &=  \lp \frac{1}{N_{\rm spl}} \sum_{k=1}^{N_{\rm spl}}c_i^{(k)}c_j^{(k)} -
  \la c_i\ra\la c_j\ra \rp \Bigg/ \sigma_{c_i} \sigma_{c_k}
  \, ,\quad i,j=1,\ldots,n_{\rm op} \, , 
\end{align}
as well as other estimators such as confidence level intervals and higher moments beyond
the quadratic approximation.
%
One should emphasize that, as discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:results}, the Gaussian approximation
is in general not reliable for most of the EFT parameters
in the case that  the quadratic
$\mathcal{O}\lp \Lambda^{-4}\rp$ corrections are accounted for.

These samples spanning the probability density in the space of
EFT Wilson coefficients could also be used to quantify {\it a posteriori} the impact
in the fit of new measurements by means of the Bayesian reweighting method
presented in~\cite{vanBeek:2019evb}.

To facilitate the usage of the results presented in this work, we also make available
via the {\tt GitHub} repository
a {\tt Python} analysis code that takes as input the samples corresponding
to a specific EFT fit and then evaluates means, correlations, and 95\% CL intervals,
as well as produces most of the plots and statistical estimators
displayed in Sect.~\ref{sec:results}.
%
In a future installment of our global EFT analysis,
we plan to release the full {\tt smefit} fitting code and the associated
theoretical and experimental inputs, together with a complete documentation
and user-friendly examples.
