\begin{abstract}
We present the first lattice-QCD calculation of the pion distribution amplitude using the large-momentum
effective field theory (LaMET) approach, which allows us to extract lightcone parton observables from a Euclidean lattice. 
The mass corrections needed to extract the pion distribution amplitude from this approach are calculated to all orders in $m^2_{\pi}/P_z^2$.
We also implement the Wilson-line renormalization which is crucial to remove the power divergences in this approach,  
and find that it reduces the oscillation at the end points of the distribution amplitude. Our exploratory result at 310-MeV pion mass favors a single-hump form broader than the asymptotic form of the pion distribution amplitude.
