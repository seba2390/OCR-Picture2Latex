  %% overview   and relation with WP3
  % In cooperation with 2Operate we have developed a stochastic simulation
  % environment for mobile networks. Our simulator interacts with
  % historical data from 2Operate and allow us to turn on and off
  % network cells, replay traffic loads, etc.

  % In relation with \emph{WP3}, we have developed an optimization tool
  % which is based on stochastic and distributed controllers computed by
  % \uppaal. We have some experiments which show that we can save up to
  % 10\% of energy.


  % %% WP4
  % In relation with \emph{WP4} and \emph{WP5}, Our simulator and
  % \uppaal models have been constructed in accordance with the 2Operate
  % data. Thus integrating our solution in the production server of
  % 2Operate is technically easy. However, we have not performed rigorous
  % testing in the production system.

  %% WP5
  In recent years, mobile network operators are showing interest in
  reducing energy consumption.  Toward this goal, in cooperation with
  the Danish company 2Operate we have developed a stochastic
  simulation environment for mobile networks. Our simulator interacts
  with historical data from 2Operate and allow us to turn on and off
  network cells, replay traffic loads, etc.
  %
  We have developed an optimization tool which is based on stochastic
  and distributed controllers computed by \uppaal. We have conducted
  experiments in our simulation tool. Experiments show that there is a
  potential to save up to 10\% of energy. We observe that for larger
  networks, there exists a larger potential for saving energy.
  % 
  Our simulator and \uppaal controllers, have been constructed in
  accordance to the 2Operate data and infrastructure. However, a main
  difference is that current equipment do not support updating
  schedulers on hourly bases. Nevertheless, new equipment e.g.\ new
  Huawei equipment do support changing schedulers on hourly
  basis. Therefore, integrating our solution in the production server
  of 2Operate is possible. However, rigorous testing in the production
  system is required.
