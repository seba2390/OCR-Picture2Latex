\section{Conclusion}

Large mobile networks can profit from energy savings. This can be
achieved by computing schedulers which turn off or on cells while
maintaining some optimality criteria.
%
In this work we have model a given portion of the mobile network as a
stochastic game, applied different methodologies and finally used the
tool \stratego to synthesize near optimal strategies which minimize
energy consumption while maintaining coverage.

We have implemented a simulator which replays historical data. We have
performed simulations for two large geographical areas in Aalborg,
Denmark.  Our initial results are encouraging, showing energy savings
from up to 10\% and showing the scalability of our approach.


\paragraph{Future Work}

Currently we have distributed controllers which do not communicate
with each other. It would be interesting to study cooperative
distributed controllers in this contexts.  Our traffic demand model is
quite abstract and could be refined if more is available. In
particular a forecasting model for the traffic development could be of
interest. In the same manner our optimization function is quite simple,
one could consider to optimize different KPI's.
