\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we highlight one of the most important bottlenecks in AI model training for C-ITS -- insufficient data, which can be solved by federated learning in V2X communication networks. We address the individual heterogeneity problems in different layers of C-ITS and proposed a novel method, as well as an associated general framework named {\myHFed} for enhancing the pre-trained DNN model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the framework can guarantee the success of federated learning even with large-scale disconnected traffic agents in C-ITS. The comparison with other baseline methods indicates the flexibility and generality of {\myHFed} that provides opportunities to well balance the trade-off between accuracy and stability in different application scenarios. 
Besides, we believe that in our framework the robustness of federated learning can be further improved by dynamic parameter settings, which will be validated in future simulations. Moreover, time-variant latency due to road traffic topology and efficient encoding for dissemination of large DNN models remain.
