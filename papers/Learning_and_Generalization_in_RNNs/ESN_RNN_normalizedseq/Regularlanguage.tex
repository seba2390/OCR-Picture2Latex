%\section{Regular languages} \label{sec:regular}
We consider the regular languages as considered in \cite{BhattamishraAG20}.
Tomita grammars \cite{tomita:cogsci82} contain 7
regular languages representable by DFAs of small
sizes, a popular benchmark for evaluating recurrent models (see references in \cite{BhattamishraAG20}). 
We reproduce the definitions of the Tomita grammars from there verbatim:
Tomita Grammars are 7 regular langauges defined on the alphabet $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$.
Tomita-1 has the regular expression $1^\ast$.
Tomita-2 is defined by the regular expression $(10)^\ast$.
Tomita-3 accepts the strings where odd number
of consecutive 1s are always followed by an even
number of $0$'s. Tomita-4 accepts the strings that
do not contain three consecutive $0$'s. In Tomita-5 only
the strings containing an even number of $0$'s and
even number of $1$'s are allowed. In Tomita-6 the
difference in the number of $1$'s and $0$'s should be
divisible by 3 and finally, Tomita-7 has the regular
expression $0^\ast 1^\ast 0^\ast 1^\ast$. 

We also check the performance of RNNs on $\mathrm{Parity}$, which contains all languages with strings of the form $(w_1, \ldots, w_L)$ s.t. $w_1 + \ldots + w_L = 1 \mod 2$. Languages $\mathcal{D}_n$ are recursively defined as the set of all strings of the form $(0w1)^{\ast}$, where $w \in \mathcal{D}_{n-1}$, with $\mathcal{D}_0$ containing only $\epsilon$, the empty word. Other languages considered are $(00)^{\ast}$, $(0101)^{\ast}$ and $(00)^{\ast}(11)^{\ast}$. Table~\ref{table:regular} shows the number of examples in train and test data, the range of the length of the strings in the language, and the test accuracy of the RNNs with activation functions $\relu$ and $\tanh$ on the regular languages mentioned above.
