\title{\boldmath Scalar and tensor resonances in $\jpsi$ radiative decays}

\input{authors.tex}

\preprint{JLAB-THY-21-3506}
\begin{abstract}
We perform a systematic analysis of the 
$\jpsi \to \gamma \pi^0\pi^0$ and $\to \gamma K_S^0 K_S^0$ partial waves measured by BESIII. We use a large set of amplitude parametrizations to reduce the model bias. We determine the physical properties of seven scalar and tensor resonances in the $1$--$2.5\gev$ mass range.  These include the well known $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$, that are considered to be the primary glueball candidates. The hierarchy of resonance couplings determined from this analysis favors the 
 latter as the one with the largest  glueball component.
