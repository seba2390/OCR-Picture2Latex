\section{Extended Bonferroni Correction}
\label{sec:bonferroni_full}
Fig.~\ref{fig:hypo_full_table} contains the results from the pairwise hypothesis tests (\S\ref{sec:hypo_experiments}) when then Bonferroni correction is applied to set of $p$-values grouped by the dataset and correlation level pair instead of each dataset, correlation level, and metric shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hypo}.
The results are overall very similar with only a handful of results now becoming not significant.
