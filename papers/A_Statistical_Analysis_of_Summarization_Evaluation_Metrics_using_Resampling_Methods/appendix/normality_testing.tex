\section{Normality Testing}
\label{appendix:normality}
% Some statistical methods for calculating the CIs or running hypothesis tests for correlation coefficients assume the input variables are normally distributed.
% To understand if this assumption holds for the summarization data, we ran the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality \citep{ShapiroWi65}, which was reported to have the highest power out of several alternatives \citep{RazaliWa11}.

To understand if the normality assumption holds for summarization data we ran the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality \citep{ShapiroWi65}, which was reported to have the highest power out of several alternatives \citep{RazaliWa11,DBSR18,DPSR20}.
The results of the tests for the ground-truth responsiveness scores and automatic metrics are in Table~\ref{tab:normality}.
Most of the $p$-values are significant, i.e., applying a statistical test which assumes normality is incorrect in general.
