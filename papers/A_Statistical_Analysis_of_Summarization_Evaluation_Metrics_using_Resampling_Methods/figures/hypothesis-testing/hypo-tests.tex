    \caption{The results of running the \textsc{Perm-Both} hypothesis test to find a significant difference between metrics' Pearson correlations.
    A blue square means the test returned a significant $p$-value at $\alpha = 0.05$, indicating the row metric has a higher correlation than the column metric.
    An orange outline means the result remained significant after applying the Bonferroni correction.
