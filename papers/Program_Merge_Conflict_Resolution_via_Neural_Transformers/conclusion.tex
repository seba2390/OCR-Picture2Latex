This paper introduces \thistool{}, a transformer-based program merge framework that leverages token-level differencing and reformulates the task of generating the resolution sequence as a classification task over a set of primitive merge patterns extracted from real-world merge commit data. \thistool{} exploits pretraining over massive amounts of code and then finetuning on specific programming languages, achieving 64--69\% precision and 63--68\% recall of merge resolution synthesis.  Lastly, \thistool{} is flexible and effective, capable of resolving more conflicts than the existing tools in multiple programming languages.

To better evaluate the resolutions generated by \thistool{} from the perspective of users, we conduct a user study with 25 developers from large OSS projects. We ask participants to evaluate whether \thistool{} resolution suggestions are acceptable on a set of 122 of their own real-world conflicts. Results suggest, in practice, \thistool{}  resolutions would likely be accepted at a higher rate than estimated by the performance metrics chosen. Using participant feedback we identify potential ways to improve \thistool{} by improving the oracle to remove tangled changes or considering external context -- project or team level information that is not present in the conflicting files.
