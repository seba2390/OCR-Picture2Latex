\begin{abstract}

By utilizing tools from game theory, {\color{black} we develop a novel multi-period-multi-company demand response framework considering the interactions between companies (sellers of energy) and their consumers (buyers of energy).} We model the interactions in terms of a Stackelberg game, where companies set their prices and consumers respond by choosing their demands. We show that the underlying game has a unique equilibrium at which the companies  maximize their revenues while the consumers maximize their utilities subject to their local constraints. Closed-form expressions are provided for the optimal strategies of all players. Based on these solutions, a power allocation game has been formulated, which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, for which closed-form expressions are also provided. {\color{black} This equilibrium is found under the assumption that companies can freely allocate their power across the time horizon, but we also demonstrate that it is possible to relax this assumption.} {\color{blue} We further provide a fast distributed algorithm for the computation of all optimal strategies using only local information.} {\color{black} We also study the effect of variations in the number of periods (subdivisions of the time horizon) and the number of consumers.} As a consequence, we are able to find an appropriate company-to-consumer ratio when the number of consumers participating in demand response {\color{black} exceeds some threshold}. Furthermore, we show, both analytically and numerically, that the multi-period scheme provides incentives for energy consumers to participate in demand response, {\color{black} compared to the single-period framework studied in the literature \cite{sabita}}. {\color{black}In our framework, we provide a condition for the minimum budgets consumers need, and carry out case studies using real life data to demonstrate the benefits of the approach, which show potential savings of up to $30\%$ and {\color{black} equilibrium prices that have low volatility.}}
