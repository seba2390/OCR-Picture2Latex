 In this paper, we presented a methodology for lifting safety case analysis algorithms to software product lines. We also outlined a certification infrastructure (data structures and correctness criteria) for our lifting approach using the Lean interactive theorem prover. We demonstrated both the approach and correctness certification on formalizing and lifting a Change Impact Assessment (CIA) algorithm~\cite{Kokaly:2017}. We discussed the implementation of the lifted CIA algorithm as part of the safety model management system MMINT-A~\cite{Fung:2018}. 
 A lifted CIA algorithm allows for reusing impact assessment conclusions across a potentially exponential  (in number of features) different product variants, as opposed to using a product-level CIA algorithm in individual product instances, which is intractable in most cases.
 
 For future work, we are working together with an industrial partner on applying our lifted algorithm to their assurance case models. We also plan to lift other safety case algorithms (including slicers), and add their implementations to MMINT-A. Visualization of the analysis results and improved user interaction is another area of future improvements.
