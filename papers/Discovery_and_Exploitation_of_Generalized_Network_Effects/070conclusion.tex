 We analyze the \neteffect (\nef) in node classification 
 in the presence of only  few labels (``label sparsity'').
Our proposed \method has the following  desirable properties:
\ben
    \item {\em \theory}: a statistical test \methodtest to identify the presence of \nef,
    \item {\em \general} and {\em \explain}: a closed-form solution \methodest to estimate \nef, if there is any, and
    \item {\em \accurate} and {\em \scale}: \methodexp to efficiently exploit \nef for better performance.

% (i) {\em \theory}: \methodtest to identify the presence of \nef,
% (ii) {\em \general} and {\em \explain}: \methodest to estimate \nef, if there is any, and
% (iii) {\em \accurate} and {\em \scale}: \methodexp to efficiently exploit \nef for better performance.
Applied on a real-world graph with {\em$22.3$M} edges, \method only requires {\em $14$ minutes}, and outperforms baselines on both accuracy and speed ($\geq 7\times$).

% We present Network Effect Analysis (\nea) to identify whether a graph exhibit \nef or not, 
% and then present \method to solve node classification, which has the following advantages:
% \ben
%     \item {\bf \accurate}: thanks to the compatibility matrix estimation by \nef, and \nd that weighs important neighbors.
%     \item {\bf \explain}: it interprets interrelations of classes with the estimated compatibility matrix.
%     \item {\bf \scale}: it scales linearly with the input size.
%     % {\color{red} (see table/figure *** )}
%     \item {\bf \theory}: it provides provable guarantees (Lemma~\ref{lem:crw2} and \ref{lem:con}) and closed-form solution (Lemma~\ref{lem:nef}).
% \een
% Applied on a real-world \textit{million-scale} graph with over $22$M edges, \method only requires {\em $12$ minutes}, and outperforms recent baselines on accuracy, as well as on speed ($\geq 9\times$).
