% %=== Autonomous exploration is important ===
% Autonomous exploration in unknown environments using mobile robots is the pillar of many robotic applications.
% %=== What problem are we solving? ===
% Existing exploration frameworks either select the nearest geometric frontier or the nearest information-theoretic frontier.
% However, \textit{just because a frontier itself is informative does not necessarily mean that the robot will be in an informative area after reaching that frontier}.
% %=== Our solution ===
% To fill this gap, we propose to use a multi-objective variant of Monte-Carlo tree search that provides a non-myopic Pareto optimal action sequence leading the robot to a frontier with greatest extent of unknown area uncovering.
% We also adopted Bayesian Hilbert Map (BHM) for continuous occupancy mapping and made it more applicable to real-time tasks.
% % TODO: no need for two-stage planning
% %=== Results and take-home messages ===
% \WZ{Simulation and field experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method?}
