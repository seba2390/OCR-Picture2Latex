\begin{abstract}
  \tool{} is a superoptimizer for LLVM's intermediate representation
  that focuses on integer SIMD instructions, both portable and
  specific to x86-64.
  %
  We created it to attack problems in finding missing peephole
  optimizations for SIMD instructions---this is challenging because
  there are many such instructions and they can be semantically
  complex.
  %
  \tool{} runs a hybrid synthesis algorithm where instructions are
  enumerated concretely, but literal constants are generated by the
  solver.
  %
  We use Alive2 as a verification engine; to do this we modified it to
  support synthesis and also to support a large subset of Intel's
  vector instruction sets (SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512).
  %
  \tool{} finds many profitable optimizations that are missing from
  LLVM\@.
  %
  It achieves limited speedups on the integer parts of SPEC CPU2017,
  around 1.3\%, and it speeds up the test suite for the libYUV
  library by 2.2\%, on average, and by 1.64x maximum, when targeting
  an Intel Cascade Lake processor.
