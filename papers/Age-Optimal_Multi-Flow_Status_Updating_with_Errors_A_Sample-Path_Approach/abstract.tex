%In this paper, we study an age of information minimization problem, where multiple flows of update packets are sent over multiple servers to their destinations. Two online scheduling policies are proposed. When  the packet generation and arrival times  are synchronized across the flows, the proposed policies are shown to be (near) optimal for minimizing any \emph{time-dependent}, \emph{symmetric}, and \emph{non-decreasing} penalty function of the ages of the flows over time in a stochastic ordering sense. {\red revise abstract later}

In this paper, we study an age of information minimization problem in \emph{continuous-time} and \emph{discrete-time} status updating systems that involve \emph{multiple packet flows}, \emph{multiple servers}, and \emph{transmission errors}. Four scheduling policies are proposed. 
We develop a unifying sample-path approach and use it to show that, when the packet generation and arrival times  are synchronized across the flows, the proposed policies are (near) optimal for minimizing any \emph{time-dependent}, \emph{symmetric}, and \emph{non-decreasing} penalty function of the ages of the flows over time in a stochastic ordering sense.
