%Though many techniques have been applied to prevent the command injections, the attackers can still execute malicious commands by leveraging the advance-with-time methods or bugs in the software. 
In this paper, we introduce \sysname, a randomization based \updated{command}{input} injection prevention technique. \sysname is more robust than state-of-the-art randomization techniques\updated{, preventing advanced attacks exploiting subtle language dialects}{}.
Our extensive evaluation results show that \sysname successfully prevents advanced attacks with low overhead (\updated{3.69\% on web servers and 5.83\% on embedded devices}{$<$4\%}).  We release our tool's source code and result to public~\cite{csr-tool}.
