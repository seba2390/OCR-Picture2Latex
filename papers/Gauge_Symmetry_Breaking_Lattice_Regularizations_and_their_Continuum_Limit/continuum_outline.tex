\begin{abstract}
    Lattice regularizations are pivotal in the non--perturbative quantization of gauge field theories.
    Wilson's proposal to employ group-valued link fields simplifies the regularization of gauge fields in principal fiber bundles, preserving gauge symmetry within the discretized lattice theory.
    Maintaining gauge symmetry is desirable as its violation can introduce unwanted degrees of freedom.
    However, not all theories with gauge symmetries admit gauge--invariant lattice regularizations, as observed in general relativity where the diffeomorphism group serves as the gauge symmetry.
    In such cases, gauge symmetry--breaking regularizations become necessary.
    In this paper, we argue that a broken lattice gauge symmetry is acceptable as long as gauge symmetry is restored in the continuum limit.
    We propose a method to construct the continuum limit for a class of lattice--regularized Hamiltonian field theories, where the regularization breaks the Lie algebra of first--class constraints.
    Additionally, we offer an approach to represent the exact gauge group on the Hilbert space of the continuum theory. 
    The considered class of theories is limited to those with first--class constraints linear in momenta, excluding the entire gauge group of general relativity but encompassing its subgroup of spatial diffeomorphisms.
    We discuss potential techniques for extending this quantization to the full gauge group.
