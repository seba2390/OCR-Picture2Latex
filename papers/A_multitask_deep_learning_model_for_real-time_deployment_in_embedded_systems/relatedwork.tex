\subsection{Multitask Learning}

MTL has been succesfully used in different domains, including CV \cite{UberNet,MaskRCNN}. Some challenges appear when applying it \cite{Caruana}: \textit{learning speed} differences between tasks and  deciding \textit{what to share} according to the \textit{relatedness} between tasks in the multitask architecture \cite{Stitch, AdaptiveFeatureSharing}.

\subsection{Semantic Segmentation}

Semantic segmentation aims at partitioning parts of images belonging to the same semantic class, typically via pixel-wise classification. Fully convolutional networks (FCN) \cite{FCN} have improved both accuracy and speed for dense prediction problems by using only convolutional layers. Upsampling layers allow a segmentation output size equal to the input and skip connections add finer details. Other approaches add post-processing steps \cite{DeeplabCRF}, learnable \textit{deconvolution} layers \cite{ Deconv} or global context \cite{ParseNet}.

\subsection{Object Detection}

Object detection aims at finding in an image all instances of objects and classifying them in a number of classes. Faster R-CNN \cite{FasterRCNN} was the first to give close to real-time performance. YOLO \cite{YOLO} avoids the generation of region proposals for increased speed. SSD \cite{SSD} avoids fully-connected layers for speed and takes features at different levels for improved accuracy. 

%\cite{SpeedAccuracy} reviews the speed vs. accuracy trade-off for different object detectors.
