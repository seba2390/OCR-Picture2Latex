\subsection{Model details}

Extended details on our new model architecture, datasets and training strategies can be found in \cite{thesismiquel}. We select a ResNet-50 \cite{Residual} as our base network, FCN with a skip connection for the semantic segmentation task and SSD for objection detection due to their speed vs. accuracy trade-offs. Fig.~\ref{multinet} shows our multitask model.

\subsection{Datasets}

For the Pascal VOC dataset \cite{PascalRetro}, we only use the subset of samples that have ground-truth annotations for both tasks from VOC07, VOC12 and SBD\cite{SBD}.

As there is no aerial view dataset with annotations for both tasks, we interleave images from Stanford Drone Dataset \cite{StanfordDrone} for object detection and the much smaller Okutama/Swiss \cite{Laurmaa} datasets for semantic segmentation in each mini-batch.
