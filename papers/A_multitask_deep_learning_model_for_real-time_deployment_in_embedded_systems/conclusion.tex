We conclude that MTL has the potential to give superior performance in the accuracy vs. speed over using multiple single-task models simultaneously as far as the two analyzed are concerned. This is in exchange of a training process that is more complex as it requires extra choices to be made, a new tuning of the parameters that jointly works well for each task and overcoming new challenges that were not present in the training of single-task models.
