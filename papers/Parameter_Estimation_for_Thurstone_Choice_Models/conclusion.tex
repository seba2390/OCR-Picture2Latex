The results of this paper elucidate how the estimation accuracy of a Thurstone choice model parameter depends on the given model and the structure of comparison sets. They show that a key factor is the algebraic connectivity of a weighted-adjacency matrix, which is specific to given model. It is shown that for a large class of Thurstone choice models, including well-known instances, there is a diminishing returns decrease of the estimation error with the cardinality of comparison sets at a slow rate for comparison sets of three of more items. 

The results provide guidelines to the designers of competition schedules such as to ensure that a schedule has a well-connected weighted-adjacency matrix and to expect limited estimation accuracy gains by enlarging the size of comparison sets.
