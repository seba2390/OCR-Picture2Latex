\subsection{Stream-surface coordinates}
\label{app:mtheta}
The q3D-grid is transformed into a 2D-grid by means of the stream-surface coordinates $m'$ and $\vartheta$.
With the turbo-machine axis defined in positive $x$-direction and the radius defined as $r = \sqrt{y^2+z^2}$, the transformation into stream surface coordinates is given by:
\begin{align}
m' &= \int \sqrt{\abl x^2 +\abl r^2} & \vartheta &= \tan^{-1}(z/y)
\end{align}
In practice this integral is solved by using $m'_0 = 0$ and 
\begin{align}
m'_i &= m'_{i-1} + \frac{2}{r_i+r_{i-1}}
	\sqrt{(r_i+r_{i-1})^2+(x_i+x_{i-1})^2}
\end{align}
This transformation leads to non-dimensional coordinates. 
% For convenience we use for the 2D grid:
% \begin{align}
% x &= R_\text{LE} m', &&& y &= R_\text{LE} \vartheta,
% \end{align}
% with the radius at the leading edge $R_\text{LE}$. In this way the chord length and pitch are invarant to the transformation.

\subsection{Sound power level}
\label{sec:PWL}
% \begin{multicols}{2}
The sound power $P$ is defined as
\begin{align}
P = \int_S n_i I_i \abl S,
\end{align}
with $S$ the integration surface, $n_i$ the surface normal vector, and $I_i$ the net acoustic intensity defined by \citet{Morfey_Sound_1971} as
% \end{multicols}
\begin{align}
I_i = <pu_i> + \frac{u^0_i }{\rho_0 c_0} <pp> + \frac{u^0_i u^0_j}{c_0^2} <pu_j> + \rho_0 u^0_j <u_i u_j >.
\end{align}
% \begin{multicols}{2}
Instead of using the rms value indicated by $<ab>$, the cross-spectral density function $S_{ab}$ is used
\begin{align}
<ab> \mapsto  S_{ab}.
\end{align}

For the 2D-cascade the integration surface $\abl S$ is replaced by a discrete segment $\Delta S$. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:powerSketch}. In the upper left corner, the cascade and the microphone positions are shown. Along a line in the $y$-direction, which corresponds to the circumference of the duct $r\theta$, the axial intensity is determined. A correction of 2D to 3D turbulence must be considered assuming the main sound source is the transversal velocity component\footnote{An additional correction for the difference of 2D and 3D propagation does not need to be considered for computations of sound power}. For the von \Karman turbulence spectrum it is given by a quotient $Q_{2D\rightarrow3D}$ of Eq.~\ref{eq:E22_Karman_3D} to Eq.~\ref{eq:E22_Karman_2D}. Assuming that the intensity at position $m$ is representative for a circle segment $\Delta S_m$, the sound power in a comparable duct can be determined by 2D axial intensities of a cascade as
\begin{align}\label{eq:P}
P = Q_{2D\rightarrow3D} \sum\limits_{m=1}^{N_m} I_{x,m} \Delta S_m
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}\label{eq:2D3DGeschwSpektrum}
Q_{2D\rightarrow3D} = \frac{E_{22}^{3D}(k_1)}{E_{22}^{2D}(k1)} = \frac{1}{10}\left(3\hat k_1^{-2}+8\right).
\end{align}

\subsection{Velocity Spectra}\label{app:VelSpectra}
In this investigation, the RPM method generates isotropic turbulence of von Karman shape. For validation, the synthesized spectra are compared to the analytical solution. The velocity one-dimensional wavenumber autospectra in flow direction $\bfm e_1$ and in the direction perpendicular to the flow $\bfm e_2$ are given as:
\begin{align}
E_{11}(k_1) = \frac{u_t^2\Lambda}{\pi} \frac{1}{(1+\hat k_1^2)^{5/6}}  \label{eq:E11_Karman}\\
E_{22}(k_1) = \frac{u_t^2\Lambda}{2 \pi} \frac{1+\frac{8}{3} \hat k_1^2}{(1+\hat k_1^2)^{11/6}} \label{eq:E22_Karman_3D}
\end{align}
with the convective wavenumber $k_1 = \omega/u_0$, the integral length scale (TLS) $\Lambda$, the turbulence velocity variance $u_t$ and the reduced wavenumber $\hat k = k /k_e$ with $k_e = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(5/6)}{\Lambda\Gamma(1/3)}$. For 2D turbulence the lateral velocity one-dimensional wavenumber autospectrum differs and is given as:
\begin{align}\label{eq:E22_Karman_2D}
E_{22}^{2D}(k_1) &= \frac{5 u_t^2\Lambda}{3\pi}  \frac{\hat k_1^2}{\left(1+\hat k_1^2\right)^{11/6}}.
\end{align}
Using the Taylor hypothesis all these can be transformed into frequency space by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Sii}
S_{ii}(f)=2 E_{ii}(k_1)\frac{2\pi}{u_0}.
\end{equation}
% \end{multicols}


\subsection{Cut-on frequencies}\label{app:cuton}
Often fan spectra calculated with the (linear) wave equations exhibit peaks at frequencies where a new acoustic mode of azimuthal order $m$ and $n$  suddenly becomes cut-on. This is particularly true in the low frequency range where the number of cut-on modes is small. The cut-on frequency in a two dimensional annular duct (infinitely thin) depends on the azimuthal mode order only, the geometry and the flow speed. For flows including swirl, there is a difference for positive and negative azimuthal mode orders $m$. The cut-on frequencies are given by
\begin{align}
f_c(m<0) &= \
%frac{|m|c_0}{2\pi R} \sqrt{1-\left|M_x^2+M_y^2\right|} &= 
\frac{|m| c_0}{N_V s_V} \left(M_y - \sqrt{1-M_x^2}\right), \\
f_c(m>0) &= 
%&=   
\frac{|m| c_0}{N_V s_V} \left(M_y + \sqrt{1-M_x^2}\right)
\end{align}
with $c_0$ the speed of sound and $M_x$ and $M_y$  the axial and circumferential flow Mach number components, respectively.
