\section{Problem Definition and Goals}
\label{sec:problem}
\vspace{-0.5em}

Our goal is to generate globally harmonized images that respect a user's desired scene composition, both in terms of \textit{spatial fidelity}, i.e., preserving the positions and sizes of the desired objects, as well as \textit{appearance fidelity}, i.e., preserving the visual characteristics of the objects. 
We propose that the user describe their intent by means of a sequence of layers alongside a global text prompt. For brevity, we call this combination a \emph{collage}. 
We first define a collage, then introduce our goals for collage-conditional generation. 

As illustrated in \cref{fig:method}, we define collage $C$ as:
\begin{enumerate}%
    \item A full-image text string $c$, describing the entire image to be generated (``A bento box with rice, edamame, ginger, and sushi'')
    \item A sequence of $n$ layers $l_1, l_2, ... l_n$, ordered from back to front, with each $l_i$ having:
    \begin{enumerate}[labelsep=0.5em,itemsep=-0.25em]
        \item An RGBA image $x_i$ (the alpha-masked input image of sushi), with alpha layer $x^\alpha_i$ 
        \item A text string $c_i$ describing the layer, which is a substring of $c$ (``sushi'')
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

Given input collage $C$, 
we seek to generate output image $x^*_c$ with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}%
    \item \textit{Global harmonization}: $x^*_c$ is harmonized, having the consistency of a real image. In Figure~\hyperlink{fig:teaser}{1}, the output features consistent perspective, lighting, and occlusions among scene objects. 
    \item \textit{Spatial fidelity}: for all layers $l_i$, the objects described by layer text $c_i$ are generated in the correct regions of $x^*_c$. In Figure~\hyperlink{fig:teaser}{1}, ``edamame,'' ``ginger,'' etc. are all in the same regions of the output image as in the input collage.
    \item \textit{Appearance fidelity}: for all layers $l_i$, in addition to matching layer text $c_i$, regions of $x^*_c$ that depict the contents of the layer share key visual characteristics with $x_i$. In Figure~\hyperlink{fig:teaser}{1}, the ``ginger'' in the output image remains sliced sushi ginger (not whole ginger), etc.
\end{enumerate}

In order to achieve the consistency of a real image, we aim to constrain both the spatial layout of generated images and certain aspects of the appearance of individual objects, allowing other aspects to vary in the harmonization process.
