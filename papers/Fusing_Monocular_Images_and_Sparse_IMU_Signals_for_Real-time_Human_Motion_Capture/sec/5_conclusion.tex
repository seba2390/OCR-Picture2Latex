\section{CONCLUSION}
In this paper, we present a method that fuses monocular images with 6 IMUs for real-time human motion capture, which can deal with extreme lighting, severe occlusion, and even subjects out of camera view.
%
The dual coordinate strategy makes the neural network better learn from the inertial signals in different cases.
%
The hidden state feedback enables the two branches in the dual coordinate strategy to exchange information from time to time, thus allowing the one with high confidence to help the other achieve better results. 
%
Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method can reconstruct more robust and accurate motion over state-of-the-art methods.
