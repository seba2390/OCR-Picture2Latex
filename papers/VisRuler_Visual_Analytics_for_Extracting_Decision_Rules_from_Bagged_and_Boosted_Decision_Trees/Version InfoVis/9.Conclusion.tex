We presented \textsc{VisRuler}, a VA tool that allows users to explore diverse rules extracted from bagged and boosted decision trees to reach a consensus about a final decision for each individual case. The multiple coordinated views facilitate the selection of diverse and performant models, the characterization of per-feature contribution, the management of multiple decisions, the analysis of global decisions, and support case-based reasoning. A use case and a usage scenario with real-world data sets emphasize the necessity for combining similar, but yet, different algorithms and the importance of transparency in critical domains. We also validate the usability and efficacy of \textsc{VisRuler} via a user study. Finally, we describe a series of limitations of our VA system with an ultimate goal to extract future directions for our work.
