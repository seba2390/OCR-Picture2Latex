\subsection{Fuzzy Inference}
\label{pas_prior_inference}

Priorities of security requirements are inferred by a Mamdani-Type \cite{mamdani1974application} FIS using the fuzzy rule-base of Figure~\ref{fig_rulebase}. In this regard, linguistic priorities Optional (O), Weak (W), Normal (N), or Strong (S) will be assigned to security requirements. Fuzzy rules of course can be tailored to the organizational and technical concerns of stakeholders. Priorities of the OBS security requirements are listed in Table~\ref{table_rds}. Each security requirement in Table~\ref{table_rds} is assigned $ 14 $ priority values each of which computed with regard to a specific security goal to assist goal-based prioritization and selection of requirements. Goal-based PAS provides structured arguments to the stakeholders. For instance, requirement ``$R_7$" in SRL of the OBS is strongly (weakly) required for satisfaction of the goal ``$G_2$" (``$G_6$"). %Consequently other security requirements (e.g. $R_5$) might be required if satisfaction of $ G_6 $ is concerned. Figure \ref{fig_mem} demonstrates the membership functions of FIS inputs (impact, cost, technical-ability) and output (priority) for prioritization of $ R_7 $. $ R_7 $ is prioritized with respect to the top-level security goal $ S $. Membership values for FIS variables are depicted by vertical lines in their corresponding membership functions.
