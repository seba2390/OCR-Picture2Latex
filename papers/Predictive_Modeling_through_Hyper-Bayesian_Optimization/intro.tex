In cognitive science, “Predictive process modeling” is used as a plausible biological model of the brain \cite{Clark2013,Clark2015a}. The  mind is depicted as a multi-layer prediction machine performing top-down predictions of the world that are met with bottom-up streams of sensory data.  The top layers are continuously predicting what is about to be sensed. The model is refined or altered to fit the incoming signals, and this “dance” continues until “equilibrium” is reached.

We draw inspiration from this idea and present the Predictive Modeling Framework, integrating model selection and Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate finding the function optimum (Figure \ref{fig:HyerBO_framework}). Our framework uses a top level model generator (HyperBO) which is modeled through BO, an efficient method for global optimization of expensive and noisy black-box functions \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1012-2599,Snoek2012,Freitas2015}. It searches in the model space, recommending  hyperparameters ($\boldsymbol{\theta}$) for the underlying BO modeling the function space. The algorithm moves between BO in the model space and BO in the function space, where the recommended model's goodness is fed back using a score function that captures how well the model helped convergence in the function space. The score function is a key feature as it is able to offset for the moving nature of BO in the function space. This back and forth leads to quick convergence for both model selection and function optimisation. The framework improves sample efficiency and outputs information about the black-box. Existing convergence analysis of BO algorithms assume an optimal model. We prove convergence w.r.t. a changing model, being optimised alongside the optima search. Our framework is evaluated on five real world regression problems. The model selection involves finding the monotonicity information that best describes the function (Diabetes and Boston Housing), and the kernel parameters that best model the function (Concrete Compression, Fish toxicity, and Power Plant). Our contributions are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Development of Predictive Modeling framework for BO incorporating automatic model searching (HyperBO);
	\item Development of a stationary scoring function to review performance of the model search; and
	\item Convergence analysis of our framework.
\end{itemize}
