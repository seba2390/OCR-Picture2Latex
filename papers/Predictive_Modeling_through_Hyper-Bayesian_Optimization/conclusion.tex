This paper presented a novel mean of model selection during Bayesian Optimization search. The Predictive Modeling framework with HyperBO allows searching amongst the model space of GP's and assesses the performance of a given model in its progression toward the function optima. A scoring function was developed to assess the performance of a selected model at any given iteration. Experimental results applying the framework for monotonicity and length scale tuning have demonstrated its effectiveness in outperforming standard BO. Theoretical analysis proves convergence. \iffalse In addition applying model selection via HyperBO allows information about the black box function to be extracted during the optimization process. \fi
