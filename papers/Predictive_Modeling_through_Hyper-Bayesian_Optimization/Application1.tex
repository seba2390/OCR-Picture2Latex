It is common for the length scale of the model GP to be tuned periodically with observations during the optimization process. We instead separate the length scale tuning outside of the BO and into the HyperBO framework in order to achieve faster convergence. The length scales for each dimensions, expressed within the $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ vector, are assumed to be anisotropic.

\subsubsection{Length Scale Regularization}
A regularization is applied to the score function to weight the score towards larger length scale values to prevent over sensitivity to a given input dimension. The overall score function used is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:length_score}
g(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{f^{+}(A_{p}(\boldsymbol{\theta}))-y^{+}}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{log} T^{d+1}}{T}}}\left(1-\lambda\left\|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right\|\right)
\end{equation}
where, $\lambda$ is the regularization weight.
