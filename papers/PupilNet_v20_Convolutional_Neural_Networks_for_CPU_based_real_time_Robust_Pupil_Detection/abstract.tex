Real-time, accurate, and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite for
pervasive video-based eye-tracking.  However, automated pupil detection in
real-world scenarios has proven to be an intricate challenge due to fast
illumination changes, pupil occlusion, non-centered and off-axis eye recording,
as well as physiological eye characteristics.
In this paper, we approach this challenge through: I) a convolutional neural
network (CNN) running in real time on a single core, II) a novel computational
intensive two stage CNN for accuracy improvement, and III) a fast propability
distribution based refinement method as a practical alternative to II.
We evaluate the proposed approaches against the state-of-the-art pupil detection
algorithms, improving the detection rate up to $\approx9$\% percent points on average over all data sets.
This evaluation was performed on over 135,000 images: 94,000 images from the
literature, and 41,000 new hand-labeled and challenging images contributed by
this work.
