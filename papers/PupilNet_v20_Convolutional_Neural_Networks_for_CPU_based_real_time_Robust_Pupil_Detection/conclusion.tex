\section{Conclusion}
We presented a naturally motivated pipeline of specifically configured CNNs for
robust pupil detection and showed that it outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches while avoiding high computational costs. For the
evaluation we used over 135,000 hand labeled images -- 41,000 of which were
contributed by this work -- from real-world recordings with artifacts such as
reflections, changing illumination conditions, and occlusions. Specially for
these challenging data sets, the CNNs reported considerably higher detection rates
than state-of-the-art techniques. Looking forward, we are planning to
investigate the applicability of the proposed pipeline to online scenarios,
where continuous adaptation of the parameters is a further challenge. For
further research and usage, data sets, source code for data generation and
training, as well as the trained CNNs will be made available for download.
