\begin{abstract}
We describe a family of new algorithms for finding the canonical image of a set
of points under the action of a permutation group. This family of algorithms
makes use of the orbit structure of the group, and a chain of subgroups of the
group, to efficiently reduce the amount of search that must be performed to
find a canonical image.

We present a formal proof of correctness of our algorithms and describe experiments
on different permutation groups that compare our algorithms with the previous
state of the art.

\section{Minimal and Canonical Images}

Throughout this paper, $\Omega$ will be a finite set, $G$ a subgroup of
$\Sym{\Omega}$, and $\Omega$ will be ordered by some (not necessarily total)
order $\leq$.
%\begin{hyp}\label{main}
%  Suppose that $G$ is a finite group that acts on a finite set $\Omega$.
%\end{hyp}
If $\alpha \in \Omega$, then we denote the orbit of $\alpha$ under $G$ by $\alpha^G$.
Simlarly, if \(A \subseteq \Omega\) and $g \in G$, then 
\(A^g := \{a^g \mid a \in A\}\) and \(A^G := \{ A^g \mid g \in G \}\).

In this paper, we want to efficiently solve the problem of deciding, given two subsets
\(A,B \subseteq \Omega\), if \(A \in B^G\). We do this by defining a canonical image:

\begin{defi}
  A \textbf{canonical labelling function} $C$ for the action of $G$ on a set $\Omega$ is a function
  $C:\powset(\Omega) \rightarrow \powset(\Omega)$ such that, for all $A  \subseteq \Omega$,
  it is true that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $C(A) \in A^G$, and
  \item ${C(A^g)} = C(A)$ for all $g \in G$.
  \end{itemize}

  In this situation we call $C(A)$ the \textbf{canonical image} of
  $A \subseteq  \Omega$ (with respect to $G$ in this particular action).

  Further, we say that $g_A \in G$ is a \textbf{canonizing element} for \(A\) if and only if
  $A^{g_A} = C(A)$.
\end{defi}


A canonical image can be seen as a well-defined
representative of a $G$-orbit on $\Omega$ with respect to the defined action. While in this
paper we will only consider the action of \(G\) on a set of subsets of \(\Omega\), canonical images are
defined similarly for any group and action.
In practice we want to be able to find canonical images effectively and
efficiently.
In some situations we are interested in computing the canonizing element,
which might not be uniquely determined. Our algorithms will always produce a
canonizing element as a byproduct of search.
We choose to make this explicit here to make the exposition clearer.


Minimal images are a special type of canonical image.

\begin{rem}
  Suppose that $\preccurlyeq$ is a partial order on $\Omega$ such that any
  two elements in the same orbit can be compared by $\preccurlyeq$.

   Let $\Min_\preccurlyeq$ denote the function that, for all $\omega \in \Omega$, maps $\omega$ to the
  smallest element in its orbit. Then $\Min_\preccurlyeq$ is a canonical labelling function.
\end{rem}

In practical applications we are interested in more structure, namely in structures
that $G$ can act on naturally via the action on a given set $\Omega$. These
structures include subsets of $\Omega$, graphs with vertex set $\Omega$, sets of
maps with domain or range $\Omega$, and so on.


In this paper, our main application will be finding canonical images when
acting on a set of subsets of $\Omega$.

\begin{defi}\label{metaorder}
  Suppose that $\leq$ is a total order of $\Omega$.
  Then we introduce a total order $\preccurlyeq$ on $\powset(\Omega)$ as follows:

  We say that $A$ \textbf{is less than} $B$ and write $A \preccurlyeq B$ if and only if $A$
  contains an element $a$ such that $a \notin B$ and $a \leq b$ for all
  $b \in B \setminus A$.
\end{defi}

\begin{ex}
  Let $\Omega:=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ with the natural order and let $A:=\{1,3,4\}$,
  $B:=\{3,5,7\}$, $C:=\{3,6,7\}$, $D:=\{1,3\}$ and $E:=\{2\}$.

  Now $A \preccurlyeq B$, because $1 \in A$, $1 \notin B$ and $1$ is smaller
  than all the elements in $B$, in particular those not in $A$. Moreover $A \preccurlyeq C$ for the same reason. Furthermore, $B \preccurlyeq C$,
  because $5 \in B$, $5 \notin C$, and if we look at $C \setminus B$, then
  this only contains the element $6$ and $5$ is smaller.

  Next we consider $A$ and $D$. As $4 \in A \setminus D$ and $D\setminus A=\varnothing$, we see that $A \preccurlyeq D$. Also $A \preccurlyeq E$ because $1 \in A \setminus E$ and $1$ is smaller than all elements in $E \setminus A=E$.
  Finally $E \preccurlyeq B$ because $2 \in E \setminus B=E$ and $2$ is smaller than all elements in $B \setminus E=B$.
\end{ex}

\begin{rem}
The example illustrates that this new order introduced above reduces to lexicographical order for sets of the same size. But for sets of different sizes, it might seem counter-intuitive. Our reason for choosing this different ordering is that it satisfies the
following property:

If \(n \in \N\) and if \(A\) and \(B\) are sets of integers, then \(A \cap \{1,\dots,n\} < B \cap \{1,\dots,n\}\) implies \(A < B\). This means that, when building \(A\) and \(B\) incrementally, we know the order of \(A\) and \(B\) as soon as we find the first integer that is contained in one of the sets but not in the other. This is not true for lexicographic ordering of sets, as \(\{1\} < \{1,2\}\) but \(\{1,1000\} > \{1,2,1000\}\).
\end{rem}

If $G$ is a subgroup of $\Sym{\Omega}$ and $\omega \in \Omega$, then we denote by
$G_\omega$ the point stabilizer of $\omega$ in $G$. For distinct elements
$x,y \in \Omega$, we denote by \(G_{x \mapsto y}\)  the set of all elements of
$G$ that map $x$ to $y$. This set may be empty.

We remark that the above information is readily available from a stabilizer chain
for the group $G$, which can be calculated efficiently. For further details
we refer the reader to \cite{HCG}. We now introduce some notation and then prove a basic result about cosets.

\begin{defi}
 Let $G$ be a permutation group acting on a totally ordered set
 $(\Omega, \leq)$, and let $\preccurlyeq$ denote the induced ordering as explained in Definition \ref{metaorder}.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and $S \subseteq \Omega$.
Then we define
  \textbf{the minimal image of $S$ under $H$} to be the smallest element in the set
  $\{S^h \mid h \in H\}$ with respect to $\preccurlyeq$.

In order to simplify notation, we will from now on write $\leq$ for the induced order and then we write $\Min(H,S,\leq)$ for the minimal image of $S$ under $H$.
\end{defi}


\begin{lem}\label{miniprop}
  Let $G$ be a permutation group acting on a totally ordered set
  $(\Omega, \leq)$, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and $S \subseteq \Omega$.
  Then the following hold for all $x,y \in \Omega$:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  For all $\sigma \in H_{x \mapsto y}$ it is true that
  $\sigma \cdot H_y=H_{x\mapsto y}=H_x \cdot \sigma$.

\item
  If $\sigma \in H_{x \mapsto y}$, then
  \(\Min(\sigma \cdot H, S, \leq) = \Min(H, S^{\sigma}, \leq)\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  If $\sigma \in H_{x \mapsto y}$, then multiplication by $\sigma$ from the
  right or left is a bijection on $H$, respectively. For all $\alpha \in H_x$ we
  have that $\alpha \cdot \sigma$ maps $x$ to $y$ and for all $\beta \in H_y$ we
  see that $\sigma \cdot \beta$ also maps $x$ to $y$. This implies the first
  statement.

  For (ii) we just look at the definition: $\Min(\sigma \cdot H, S, \leq)$ denotes
  the smallest element in the
  set $\{S^{\sigma\cdot h} \mid h \in H\}$ and $\Min(H, S^{\sigma}, \leq)$
  denotes the smallest element in the set $\{(S^\sigma)^h \mid h \in H\}$,
  which is the same set.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Worked Example}

We will find minimal, and later canonical, images using similar techniques to
Linton in \cite{Linton:SmallestImage}. This algorithm splits the problem into
small sub-problems, by splitting a group into the cosets of a point stabilizer.
We will begin by demonstrating this general technique with a worked
example.

\begin{ex}\label{ex:minimal}
  In the following example we will look at $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$,
  the subgroup {$G = \langle (14)(23)(56), (126)\rangle \leq \SX{6}$},
  and $S = \{2,3,5\}$.
  We intend to find the minimal image $\Min(G,S, \leq)$, where the ordering on
  subsets of $\Omega$ is the induced ordering from $\leq$ on $\Omega$ as explained in
  Definition \ref{metaorder}.

  We split our problem into pieces by looking at cosets of \(G_1 = \langle (3,4,5)
  \rangle\). The minimal image of \(S\) under \(G\) will be realized by an
  element contained in (at least) one of the cosets of \(G_1\), so if we find
  the minimal image of \(S\) under elements in each coset, and then take the
  minimum of these, we will find the global minimum.

  Lemma \ref{miniprop} gives that, for all $g \in G$, it holds that $\Min(g \cdot
  G_1, S, \leq) = \Min(G_1, S^g, \leq)$, and
  so we can change our problem from looking for the minimal image of $S$ with
  respect to cosets of \(G_1\) to looking at images of \(S^g\) under elements of
  $G_1$ where $g$ runs over a set of coset representatives of $G_1$ in $G$.

  For each $i \in \{1,\dots,6\}$ we need an element
  $g_i \in G_{i \mapsto 1}$ (where any exist), so that we can then consider $S^{g_i}$.

  We choose the elements $\id$, $(162)$, $(146523)$, $(14)(23)(56)$, $(142365)$
  and $(126)$ and obtain six images of $S$:
  \[
    \{2,3,5\}, \{1,3,5\}, \{3,1,2\}, \{3,2,6\}, \{3,6,1\}, \{6,3,5\}.
  \]

  As we are looking at the images of these sets under \(G_1\), we
  know that all images of a set containing \(1\) will contain \(1\),
  and all images of a set not containing \(1\) will not contain \(1\).
  From Definition \ref{metaorder}, all subsets of \(\{1,\dots,6\}\)
  containing \(1\) are smaller than all subsets not containing \(1\). This means
  that we can filter our list down to $\{1,3,5\}, \{3,1,2\}$ and $\{3,6,1\}$.

  Furthermore, \(G_1\) fixes \(2\), so by the same argument we can filter our
  list of sets not containing \(2\), leaving only \(\{3,1,2\}\). The minimal image
  of this under \(G_1\) is clearly \(\{3,1,2\}\) (in this particular
  case we could of course also have stopped as soon as we saw \(\{3,1,2\}\), as
  this is the smallest possible set of size 3).

  Now, let us consider what would happen if the ordering of the integers was
  reversed, so we are looking for \(\Min(G, S, \geq)\), again with the
  induced ordering.

  For the same reasons as above, we begin by calculating
  $G_6 = \langle (3,5,4) \rangle$ and by finding images of \(S\) for some
  element from each coset of \(G_6\) in $G$.

  An example of six images is
  \[
    \{ 1, 5, 4 \}, \{ 6, 5, 3 \}, \{ 4, 6, 1 \}, \{ 5, 1, 2 \}, \{ 3, 2, 6 \},
    \{ 2, 3, 5 \}.
  \]
  We can ignore anything that does not contain \(6\), so we are left with:

  \[
    \{ 6, 5, 3 \}, \{ 4, 6, 1 \}, \{ 3, 2, 6 \}.
  \]

  As \(5\) is not fixed by \(G_6\), we can not reason about the presence
  or absence of \(5\) in our sets. There is an image of every set that
  contains \(5\), and there are even two distinct images of \(\{6,5,3\}\) that
  contain \(5\). Therefore we must continue our search by considering \(G_{6,5}\).

  Application of an element from each coset of $G_{6,5}$ to $S$ generates nine
  sets, of which four contain the element $5$. In fact we reach \(\{6,3,5\},
  \{6,5,4\}\) from the set $\{ 6, 4, 3 \}$, we reach \(\{5,6,1\}\) from the set
  $\{ 4, 6, 1 \}$ and we reach \(\{5,2,6\}\) from the set $\{ 3, 2, 6 \}$. From
  these we extract the minimal image \(\{6,5,4\}\).

  In this example, different orderings of \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\) produced different sized
  searches, with different numbers of levels of search required.
\end{ex}

\section{Minimal Images under alternative orderings of \(\Omega\)}
\label{sec:alternate ordering}
As was demonstrated in Example \ref{ex:minimal}, the choice of ordering of the set our group acts on
influences the size of the search for a minimal image. In this section we will show
how to create
orderings of $\Omega$ that, on average, reduce the size of search for a minimal image.

We begin by showing how large a difference different orderings can make. We do
this by proving that, for any choice $\preccurlyeq$ of ordering of \(\Omega\), group \(G\) and
any input set $S$, we can construct a minimal image
problem that is as hard as finding \(\Min(G,S,\preccurlyeq)\), but where
reversing the ordering on $\Omega$ makes the problem trivial.

We make this more precise: Given $n \in \N$, a permutation group \(G\) on \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) with some ordering $\leq$ and a subset \(S
\subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}\), we construct a group \(H\) and a set \(T\) such that
\(\Min(G, S, \leq) = \Min(H,T, \leq) \cap \{1..n\}\), which shows that finding
\(\Min(H,T,\leq)\) is at least as hard as finding \(\Min(G,S,\leq)\). On the
other hand, we will show that \(\Min(H,T, \geq) = T\) and that this can be deduced without search.
This is done in Lemma \ref{ex}.
An example along the way will illustrate the construction.

\begin{defi}
We fix $n \in \N$ and we let $k \in \N$. For all $j \in \N$ we define $q(j) \in
\N$ (where $q$ stands for ``quotient'') and $r(j) \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ (where $r$ stands for ``remainder'') such that $j=q(j) \cdot n+r(j)$.


Let $\ext : G \rightarrow \SX{k \cdot n}$ be the following map:
For all $g \in G$ and all $j \in \{1,\dots,k \cdot n\}$, the element
$\ext(g)$ maps $j$ to $q(j) \cdot n+r(j)^g$.
\end{defi}


\begin{ex}
Let $n=4$ and $G=\SX{4}$. Then we extend the action of $G$ to the set
$\{1,\dots,12\}$ using the map $\ext$.

For example $g=(134)$ maps $4$ to $1$.
We write $12=2 \cdot 4+4$ and then it follows that
$\ext(g)$ maps $12$ to $2 \cdot 4 +4^g=8+1=9$.
In fact $g$ acts simultaneously on the three tuples $(1,2,3,4)$, $(5,6,7,8)$
and $(9,10,11,12)$ as it does on $(1,2,3,4)$.
\end{ex}

\begin{defi}
Fixing $n,k \in \N$ and a subgroup $G$ of $\SX{n}$, and using the map $\ext$
defined above, we say that \textbf{$H$ is the extension of $G$ on
  $\{1,\dots,k\cdot n\}$}
if and only if $H=\{\ext(g) \mid g \in G\}$ is the image of $G$
under the map $\ext$.
\end{defi}

The extension $H$ of $G$ on a set $\{1,\dots,k \cdot n\}$
is a subset of $\SX{k \cdot n}$. We show now that even more is true:

\begin{lem}\label{ext}
Let $n,k \in \N$ and $G \le \SX{n}$. Then the extension of $G$ onto $\{1,\dots,k \cdot n\}$ is a subgroup of $\SX{k \cdot n}$ that is isomorphic to $G$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} Let $H:=\ext(G)$ be the image of $G$ under the map $\ext$ and let
$a,b \in G$ be distinct. Then let $j \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ be such that $j^a \neq
j^b$.
By definition $\ext(a)$ and $\ext(b)$ map $j$ in the same way that $a$ and $b$
do, so we see that $\ext(a) \neq \ext(b)$. Hence the map $\ext$ is injective.
Therefore $\ext:G \rightarrow H$ is bijective.

Next we let $a,b \in G$ be arbitrary and we let $j \in \{1,\dots,k \cdot n\}$.
Then the composition $ab$ is mapped to $\ext(ab)$, which maps $j$ to $q(j) \cdot
n+r(j)^{ab}$. Now $r(j)^{ab}=(r(j)^a)^b$ and therefore the composition
$\ext(a)\ext(b) \in \SX{k \cdot n}$ maps $j$ to $(q(j) \cdot
n+r(j)^a)^{\ext(b)}=q(j) \cdot n + (r(j)^a)^b$. This is because $r(j)^a \in
\{1,\dots,n\}$.

Hence $\ext(ab)=\ext(a)\ext(b)$. That implies $\ext$ is a group homomorphism
and hence that $G$ and its image are isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{ex}
Let $n \in \N$ and $G \le \SX{n}$. Let $H$ denote the extension of $G$ on
$\{1,\dots,(n+1) \cdot n\}$ and let $S \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}$. Let
$T:=S \cup \{ l \cdot n + l \mid l \in \{1..n\}\}$, let \(\leq\) denote the natural
ordering of the integers, and let \(\geq\) denote its reverse. For simplicity we use the same symbols for the ordering induced on $\powset(\Omega)$, respectively. Then

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\Min(H,T, \le) \cap \{1,\dots,n\} = \Min(G,S, \le)\).
\item \(\Min(H,T,\ge)=T\).
\end{itemize}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Let $h \in H$. Then by construction $h$ stabilizes the partition
$$[1,\dots,n|n+1,\dots,2n|\dots|n \cdot n,\dots,(n+1)\cdot n].$$ 
Moreover, for all $i \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ and $g \in G$ we have that $i^g=i^{\ext(g)}$
and so Lemma \ref{ext} implies that

\begin{align*}
  \Min(G,S,\le) &= \min_{\le}\{S^g \mid g \in G\}  \cap \{1,\dots,n\}\\
                &= \min_{\le}\{S^{\ext(g)} \mid g \in G\}  \cap \{1,\dots,n\}\\
                &= \min_{\le}\{S^h \mid h \in H\}  \cap \{1,\dots,n\}\\
                &= \Min(H,T, \le) \cap \{1,\dots,n\}.
\end{align*}
This proves the first statement.

For the second statement we notice that $(n + 1)\cdot n$ is now the smallest element
of $T$, and it cannot be mapped to anything smaller, because it also is the
smallest element available.
So if we let $h \in H$ be such that $T^h=\Min(H,T,\ge)$, then $h$ fixes the point $n(n + 1)$. By
definition of the extension, it follows that $h$ also fixes $k \cdot n$ for all
$k \in \{1\ldots n\}$.
The next point of $T$ under the ordering is $n^2 - 1$. It cannot be
mapped by $h$ to $n^2$, because $n^2$ is already fixed, hence $h$ has to fix
$n^2 - 1$, too.

Arguing as above it follows that all points are fixed by $h$, thus in
particular \(\Min(H,T,\ge)=T\), as stated. Furthermore, any algorithm
that stepped through the elements of \(T\) in the order we describe
would find this smallest element without having to perform a branching search,
as at each step there is no choice on which element of \(T\) is the next smallest.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Comparing Minimal Images Cheaply}

We describe some important aspects of Linton's
algorithm for computing the minimal image of a subset of $\Omega$.
\begin{defi}

Suppose that $(\Omega, \le)$ is a totally ordered set and that $G \le
\Sym{\Omega}$. Then \(\Orb(G)\) denotes the list of orbits of $G$ on $\Omega$.
This list of orbits is ordered with respect to the smallest element in each orbit under $\le$.

A $G$-orbit will be called a \textbf{singleton} if and only if it has size $1$.

If \(S \subseteq \Omega\), then we say that a $G$-orbit is \textbf{empty in S}
if and only if it is disjoint from $S$ as a set, and we say that it is
\textbf{full in S} if and only if it is completely contained in $S$.
\end{defi}

\begin{ex}
  Let \(\Omega:=\{1,\dots,8\}\), with the natural ordering on the integers, let
  \(G := \langle (1,4), (2,8), (5,6), (7,8) \rangle\) and let $S:=\{1,3,5,6\}$.

  Then \(\Orb(G) = [ \{1,4\}, \{2,7,8\}, \{3\}, \{5,6\} ]\) because this list
  contains all the $G$-orbits and they are ordered by the smallest element in each
  orbit, namely $1$ in the first, $2$ in the second, $3$ in the third, which is a
  singleton, and $5$ in the last (because $4$ is already in an earlier orbit).

  The orbits $\{3\}$ and $\{5,6\}$ are full in $S$, the orbit $\{2,7,8\}$ is
  empty in $S$ and $\{1,4\}$ is neither.
\end{ex}


\begin{lem}\label{same}
Suppose that $(\Omega, \le)$ is a totally ordered finite set and that $G \le
\Sym{\Omega}$. If
$\Min(G,S,\le)=\Min(G,T,\le)$ and $\omega \in \Omega$, then $\omega^G$ is empty in $S$ if
and only if it is empty in $T$, and $\omega^G$ is full in $S$ if and only if it is
full in $T$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\omega \in \Omega$ and suppose that $\omega^G$ is empty in $S$. As $\omega^G$
  is closed under the action of $G$, and $S_0 := \Min(G,S,\le)$ is an image
  of $S$ under the action of $G$, we see that $\omega^G$ is empty in $S_0$ and hence
  in $T_0:=\Min(G,T,\le)$. Thus $\omega^G$ is empty in $T$, which is an image of $T$
  under the action of $G$. The same arguments work vice versa.

  Next we suppose that $\omega^G$ is full in $S$. Then it is full in $S_0=T_0$ and
  hence in $T$, and the same way we see the converse.
\end{proof}

We can now prove Theorem \ref{thm:minsplit}, which provides the main technique
used to reduce search. This allows us to prove that the minimal image of some set \(S\)
will be smaller than or equal to the minimal image of a set \(T\), without explicitly
calculating the minimal image of either \(S\) or \(T\).

\begin{thm}\label{thm:minsplit}
  Suppose that \(G\) is a permutation group on a totally ordered finite set
  \((\Omega, \le)\) and that \(S\) and \(T\)
  are two subsets of \(\Omega\) where \(|S| = |T|\).

  Suppose further that \(o\) is the first orbit in the list $\Orb(G)$ that
  is neither full in both \(S\) and \(T\) nor empty in both \(S\) and \(T\). If
  \(o\) is empty in \(T\), but not in $S$, then $\Min(G,S,\le)$ is strictly
  smaller than $\Min(G,T,\le)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Suppose that \(o\) is empty in \(T\), but not in \(S\). Then $o$ is empty in
$T_0:=\Min(G,T,\le)$, but not in $S_0:=\Min(G,S,\le)$, and in particular $T_0$
and $S_0$ are distinct, as we have seen in Lemma \ref{same}.
%If $\omega \in \Omega$, then the orbit $\omega^G$ is closed under the action of $G$.
%Thus, if $A \subseteq \Omega$
%and \(\omega^G\) is full in \(A\), then for all $g \in G$ it is true that \(\omega^G\) is
%full in \(A^g\). Similarly, if \(\omega^G\) is empty in \(A\), then \(\omega^G\) is empty
%in \(A^g\) for all \(g \in G\).

Let $\alpha$ denote the minimum of the orbit $o$ with respect to $\le$ and let $\omega \in \Omega$. If $\omega < \alpha$,
then
$\omega \notin o$, so the the orbit $\omega^G$ appears in the list $\Orb(G)$
\emph{before} $o$ does. Then the choice of $o$ implies that one of the following
two cases holds:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\omega^G\) is full in both \(S\) and \(T\). In particular, for all $g \in G$ we have that
$\omega \in S^g \cap T^g$.
\item \(\omega^G\) is empty in both \(S\) and \(T\). In particular, for all $g \in G$ we have that
$\omega^G \cap S^g=\varnothing$ and $\omega^G \cap T^g=\varnothing$.
\end{enumerate}

If $S_0$ contains an element $\omega\in\Omega$ such that $\omega < \alpha$, then Case (i)
above holds and $\omega \in T_0$. So $S_0 \cap \{\omega' \in \Omega \mid \omega' < \alpha\}= T_0
\cap \{\omega' \in \Omega \mid \omega < \alpha\}$.

Since $S_0$ and $T_0$ are distinct, they must differ amongst the elements
at least as large as $\alpha$ and, since they have the same cardinality, the smallest
such element determines which of $S_0$ and $T_0$ is smaller.

We recall that $o=\alpha^G$ is empty in $T$ and non-empty in $S$, so there exists
some $g \in G$ such that $\alpha \in S^g$. Then $S^g=S_0$ and $\alpha \notin T_0$, so
$S_0$ is strictly smaller that $T_0$.
\end{proof}

Here is an example how to use Theorem \ref{thm:minsplit}.

\begin{ex}
Let $\Omega:=\{1,\dots,10\}$ with natural ordering, and let
$G:=\langle (12), (45),(56), (89)\rangle$. We consider the sets $S:=\{3,6,7\}$
and $T:=\{3,7,9\}$ and we want to calculate the smallest of \(\Min(G,S)\) and
\(\Min(G,T)\). Hence, we want to know which one is smaller as cheaply as
possible, to avoid
superfluous calculations.

We first list the orbits of $G$:
$[\{1,2\},\{3\},\{4,5,6\},\{7\},\{8,9\},\{10\}]$.

Going through the orbits as listed, we see that the first one is empty in $S$
and $T$, the second one is full in $S$ and $T$, and the third one gives a
difference for the first time. It is empty in $T$, but not in $S$, so Theorem
\ref{thm:minsplit} yields that the minimal image of $S$ is strictly smaller than
that of $T$.

\end{ex}

\subsection{Static Orderings of \(\Omega\)}\label{sec:static}

In this section we look at
which total ordering of \(\Omega\) should be used to minimize the amount
of time taken to find minimal images of subsets of $\Omega$.

Given a group \(G\) we will choose an ordering on $\Omega$ such that orbits
with few elements appear as early as possible. In particular, singleton orbits should
appear first.

This is justified by the fact that singleton orbits are always either full or empty. Also,
we would expect smaller orbits to be more likely
to be empty or full than larger orbits. This means that small orbits placed early
in the ordering of \(\Omega\) are
more likely to lead to Theorem \ref{thm:minsplit} being applicable, leading to a
reduction in search.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:minorbit} heuristically chooses a new ordering for an ordered
set \(\Omega\), only depending on the group $G$, under the assumption that the
algorithm that computes minimal images will pick a point from a smallest
non-singleton orbit to branch on.
This will not always be true -- in practice Linton's algorithm branches on the
first orbit which contains some point contained in one of the current candidates
for minimal image.

However, we will show that in Section \ref{sec:ex} that
Algorithm~\ref{alg:minorbit} produces substantially smaller,
and therefore faster, searches in practice.

It is not necessary in Line~\ref{line:point2} of Algorithm~\ref{alg:minorbit} to
choose the smallest element of \(\mathit{Points}\), choosing an arbitrary element will,
on average, perform just as well.
By fixing which point is chosen, we ensure that independent implementations will
produce the same ordering and therefore the same canonical image.


\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{FixedMinOrbit}\label{alg:minorbit}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{MinOrbitOrder}{$\Omega, G$}
    \State{\(\mathit{Remain} := \Omega\)}
    \State{\(\mathit{Order} := []\)}
    \State{\(H := G\)}
    \While{\(|\mathit{Remain}| > 0\)}
		\State{\(\mathit{OrbSize} := \Min\left\{|o|\ \mathrel{\big|}  o \in \Orb(H), o \cap \mathit{Remain} \neq \emptyset\right\}\)}\label{line:orb}
		\State{\(\mathit{Points} := \left\{o \mathrel{\big|} o \in \Orb(H), |o| = \mathit{OrbSize},  o \cap \mathit{Remain} \neq \emptyset\right\}\)}\label{line:point}
		\State{\(\mathit{MinPoint} := \Min\left\{x \mid o \in \mathit{Points}, x \in o\right\}\)}\label{line:point2}
		\State{\(\mathit{Remain} := \mathit{Remain} \backslash \{ \mathit{MinPoint} \}\)}
		\State{\(Add(\mathit{Order}, \mathit{MinPoint})\)}
		\State{\(H := G_{\mathit{MinPoint}}\)}
    \EndWhile
    \State\Return{\(\mathit{Order}\)}
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We will also consider one simple modification of Algorithm \ref{alg:minorbit}, namely
\texttt{FixedMaxOrbit} (which is the same as \texttt{FixedMinOrbit}) with line
  \ref{line:orb} changed to pick orbits of maximum size.

If our intuition about Theorem \ref{thm:minsplit} is correct, then
\texttt{MaxOrbit} should almost
always produce a larger search than \texttt{MinOrbit} or a random ordering
of \(\Omega\).

\subsection{Implementing alternative orderings of \(\Omega\)}

Having calculated an alternative \(Order\) using \textbf{FixedMinOrbit} or \textbf{FixedMaxOrbit},
we could create a version of \textbf{MinimalImage} which accepted an explicit
ordering. However, rather than editing the algorithm, we can instead perform a
pre-processing step, using Lemma~\ref{lem:map}.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:map}
  Consider a group \(G\) that acts on $\Omega = \{1,\dots,n\}$ and a
  permutation \(\sigma \in \Sym{\Omega}\). We define an ordering \(\leq_\sigma\) on
  \(\{1,\dots,n\}\), where for all $x,y \in \Omega$ we have that \(x \leq_\sigma y\) if and only if
  \(x^\sigma \leq y^\sigma\).

  For the induced orderings $\preccurlyeq$ and $\preccurlyeq_\sigma$
  on subsets of $\Omega$ as in Definition \ref{metaorder}
  it holds that
  \[ X \preccurlyeq_\sigma  Y \Leftrightarrow X^\sigma \preccurlyeq Y^\sigma \]
  for all subsets $X$ and $Y$ of $\Omega$, and hence (simplifying notation)
  \[\Min(G,S,\preccurlyeq_\sigma) = \Min(G^\sigma,S^\sigma,\preccurlyeq)^{\sigma^{-1}}.\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}

  Following Definition \ref{metaorder}, $X \preccurlyeq_\sigma Y$ if and only if
  there is an $x \in X$ such that $x\not\in Y$ and for all
  $y \in Y \backslash X$ it holds that $x \leq_\sigma y$.
  By definition of $\leq_\sigma$, this is the case whenever $x^\sigma \leq y^\sigma$,
  and since $x^\sigma \in X^\sigma$ and for all $y^\sigma$ in $Y^\sigma \backslash X^\sigma$ it
  holds that $x^\sigma \leq y^\sigma$, it follows that $X^\sigma \preccurlyeq Y^\sigma$.

  \medskip

  Consider the map $\varphi_\sigma : S^G \rightarrow (S^\sigma)^{G^\sigma}$ that maps sets
  $X \in S^G$ to $X^\sigma \in (S^\sigma)^{G^\sigma}$. This map is bijective, and by the above it respects the ordering, so the second claim follows.


\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{lem:map} gives an efficient method to calculate minimal images under
different orderings without having to alter the underlying algorithm. The most
expensive part of this algorithm is calculating \(G^\sigma\), but this is still very
efficiently implemented in systems such as GAP, and also can be cached so it
only has to be calculated once for a given \(G\) and \(\sigma\).



\section{Dynamic Ordering of \(\Omega\)}

In Section \ref{sec:static}, we looked at methods for choosing an ordering for
\(\Omega\) that allows a minimal image algorithm to search more quickly.
There is a major limitation to this technique -- it does not make use of
the sets whose canonical image we wish to find.

In this section, instead of producing an ordering ahead of time, we will
incrementally define the ordering of \(\Omega\) as the algorithm
progresses.
At each stage we will consider exactly which extension of our partially
constructed ordering will lead to the smallest increase in the number of sets we
must consider.

We are not free to choose our ordering arbitrarily as we must still map two
sets in the same orbit of \(G\) to the same canonical image.
However, we can use different orderings for sets that are in different
orbits of \(G\).

Firstly, we will explain how we build the orderings that our algorithm uses.

\section{Conclusions}

We present a general framework and a new set of algorithms for finding the
canonical image of a set under the action of a permutation group. Our
experiments show that our new algorithms outperform the previous state of the art,
often by orders of magnitude.

Our basic framework runs on the concept of refiners and selectors and is not
limited to finding only canonical images of subsets of \(\Omega\). In future
work we will investigate families of refiners and selectors that allow finding
canonical images for many other combinatorial objects.
