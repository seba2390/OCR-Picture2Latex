The goal of this research was to improve image segmentation of the BP nerve structure from US images, which was done by employing a hybrid deep neural network model. A CNN was used as the classification model, and U-net and M-net were employed as segmentation models. Three experiments were conducted on two datasets with filtered and non-filtered data. The first experiment did not use any prior classification, the second experiment used the CNN for classification, and in the third experiment, a perfect classification model was simulated by removing all negative samples from data. From these experiments, it could be concluded that performance significantly improved when using a hybrid model, and even more when using a `perfect classification' model, thus showing the promising possibilities of using hybrid model for accurate BP segmentation.
