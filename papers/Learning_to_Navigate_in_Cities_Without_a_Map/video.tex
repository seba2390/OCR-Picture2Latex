The video available at \url{http://streetlearn.cc} and \url{https://youtu.be/2yjWDNXYh5s} shows the performance of trained \emph{CityNav} agents in the Paris Rive Gauche and Central London environments, as well as of the \emph{MultiCityNav} agents trained jointly on 4 environments (Greenwich Village, Midtown, Central Park and Harlem) and then transferred to a fifth environment (Lower Manhattan). The video shows the high-resolution StreetView images (actual inputs to the network are $84\times84$ RGB observations), overlaid with the map of the environment indicating its position and the location of the goal.
