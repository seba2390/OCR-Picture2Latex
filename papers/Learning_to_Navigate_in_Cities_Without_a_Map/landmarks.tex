For the experiments on data from Manhattan, New York, we relied on sub-areas of a larger StreetView graph that contains 256961 nodes and 266040 edges. We defined 5 areas by selecting a starting point at a given coordinate and collecting panoramas in a panorama adjacency graph using breadth-first-search, until a given depth of the search tree. We defined areas as following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wall Street / Lower Manhattan: 6917 nodes and 7191 edges, 200-deep search tree starting at (40.705510, -74.013589).
    \item NYU / Greenwich Village: 17227 nodes and 17987 edges, 200-deep search tree starting at (40.731342, -73.996903).
    \item Midtown: 16185 nodes and 16723 edges, 200-deep search tree starting at (40.756889, -73.986147).
    \item Central Park: 10557 nodes and 10896 edges, 200-deep search tree starting at (40.773863, -73.971984).
    \item Harlem: 14589 nodes and 15099 edges, 220-deep search tree starting at (40.806379, -73.950124).
\end{itemize}

The Central London StreetView environment contains 24428 nodes and 25352 edges, and is defined by a bounding box between the following Lat/Long coordinates: (51.500567, -0.139157) and (51.526175, -0.080043). The Paris Rive Gauche environment contains 34026 nodes and 35475 edges, and is defined by a bounding box between Lat/Long coordinates: (48.839413, 2.2829247) and (48.866578, 2.3653221).

We provide, in a text file\footnote{Available at \url{http://streetlearn.cc}}, the locations of the 644 landmarks used throughout the study.
