\section{Introduction}
% \vspace{-3mm}

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement and demonstrate remarkable performance in many tasks~\cite{XGen, touvron2023llama2}. LLMs like GPT-4~\cite{openai2023gpt4} and LLaMA~\cite{touvron2023llama} are trained on vast corpora of text data, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant human-like text. Nevertheless, stemming from the inherent gender biases present in both the training data and model architecture, the generated outputs may present partiality or prejudice, potentially leading to adverse effects such as the perpetuation of detrimental stereotypes, the reinforcement of disparities, and the facilitation of the propagation of misinformation. Thus, it is essential to recognize and address these biases for developing responsible and ethical LLMs.

% However, despite their remarkable achievements, LLMs are not immune to bias. 
% Bias, in the context of LLMs, refers to the presence of partiality or prejudice in the generated outputs, stemming from the inherent biases present in the training data and model architecture. 

% One of the representative biases in LLMs is gender bias, which may lead to negative impacts like perpetuating harmful stereotypes, reinforcing gender inequalities and contributing to misinformation.
% One noteworthy bias found in LLMs is gender bias, which has the potential to result in adverse effects such as the perpetuation of detrimental stereotypes, the reinforcement of gender disparities, and the facilitation of the spread of misinformation. Thus, recognizing and addressing gender bias is essential for developing responsible and ethical LLMs.

% Previous research on gender bias detection and mitigation are mainly working on 
% % gender lexica~\cite{ramakrishna-etal-2015-quantitative, sap2014developing} and
% gender-explicit datasets~\cite{bhaskaran-bhallamudi-2019-good, saunders-byrne-2020-reducing}. 

In previous work, a language model is said to exhibit gender bias: 1) when the templated input contains mentions of specific gender groups (e.g., ``\textit{The woman worked as}''),
% contains ``\textit{woman}'' for the demographic \textsc{Gender})
the resulting generated sentence shows a positive or negative inclination towards that gender~\cite{bold-2021,huang-etal-2020-reducing,sheng2019woman,sheng-etal-2020-towards}; 2) the model assigns a higher probability to sentences with stereotypical combinations of gender groups and attributes compared to other combinations (e.g., ``\textit{a female CEO}'' vs. ``\textit{a male CEO}'')~\cite{bordia-bowman-2019-identifying,sheng-etal-2021-societal}. 


% However, these biases are \textit{explicit} and align with common human stereotypes. 
The former method requires \textit{explicit} gender mentions and the latter method necessitates predefined gender stereotypes. 
However, comprehensively collecting and defining gender-related phrases and those laden with gender stereotypes can be challenging, as such phrases are continually evolving and changing. Moreover, we believe that even sentences that may seem devoid of bias can still exhibit \textit{implicit} bias within LLMs. For example, \texttt{llama-7b} continues the sentence ``\textit{My friend is talking on the phone}'' with ``\textit{and she looks really happy}''. ``\textit{Talking on the phone}'' is not an action typically associated with gender stereotypes, but \texttt{llama-7b} assumes \textit{my friend} to be female without context.

To address the above limitations,
% and
% To 
% investigate different manifestations of gender bias -- both explicit and implicit, 
% investigate both explicit and implicit gender bias,
we propose a conditional text generation mechanism, which does not require any predefined gender-related phrases or stereotypes and possesses the capability to explore both explicit and implicit gender bias.
% to probe LLMs. 
Specifically, we use three distinct strategies to design the probing inputs:
% to probe LLMs to show evidence of explicit gender stereotypes and implicit gender bias in LLMs, 
% : 
1) template-based inputs containing four widely acknowledged features that are associated with gender stereotypes;
% : \textsc{hobbies}, \textsc{colors}, \textsc{personality traits}, and \textsc{occupations}
2) LLM-generated inputs that can potentially harbor underlying gender bias inherent to the LLM; and
3) naturally-sourced inputs from naturally-sourced corpus like STS-B~\cite{cer2017semeval}, which comprises sentences related to human activities and can probe the implicit bias in LLMs.

% and implicit bias in naturally collected language, respectively.
% Thus, we construct three distinct datasets, comprising template-based dataset, LLM-generated dataset, and naturally sourced language dataset, to explore gender bias within datasets created using these three different construction methods. 
% The template-based dataset is constructed based on gender stereotypes. We select four features widely acknowledged to be associated with gender stereotypes: hobbies, colors, personality traits, and occupations. 
% Moreover, we propose a new evaluation method to fairly evaluate gender bias within these three different datasets since the implicit gender bias is hard to evaluate using previous evaluation metrics like Gender Word Co-occurence Score~\cite{bordia2019identifying}. 
% We utilize text generated through LLM continuation generation and the corresponding logits of

% The rationale behind this approach is based on the fact that LLMs operate as conditional generators, thereby causing the subsequent generated sentences to reflect the inherent bias of the LLMs.
% % nature of the input sentence.

% Overall, our contributions are: 1) we propose a conditional text generation mechanism employing three distinct strategies to probe LLMs and show evidence of both explicit and implicit biases; and 2) we develop three corresponding metrics to assess these biases in the outputs of LLMs. 
% % We observe that different probing strategies lead to different results, and the generation performance of models upon these inputs varies based on their size.
% % While larger models tend to have better generation performance, this does not mean they are fairer. 
We observe that employing different probing strategies leads to different fairness performances, and a larger model does not necessarily equate to increased fairness. Even if input sentences do not contain explicit gender stereotypes, the model can still display gender bias in logits or generated text, which undoubtedly has harmful societal impacts.
% \footnote{All the source code and data will be released upon acceptance.}
% Regardless of whether input sentences contain explicit or predefined gender stereotypes, the model may still exhibit gender bias either in logits or in the generated text, which undoubtedly has adverse societal consequences.
% Larger models do have better generation performance, but not fairer.
% This means LLMs like LLaMA can exhibit gender bias in generated sentences even if the inputs are in the absence of gender information or stereotype information. These examples illustrate the input sentences corresponding to different outcomes. Regardless of whether there are explicit or predefined gender stereotypes present in the input sentences, the model may still convey gender bias either in logits or in the generated text, which undoubtedly brings about negative societal impacts. Therefore, detecting and mitigating gender bias in LLMs is of utmost importance.

% distinct 
types of strategies to stimulate conditional text generation, and present \textit{explicit} and \textit{implicit} evaluation metrics
% designed 
to assess

\subsection{Task Formulation}
% \vspace{-3mm}

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a LLM, and 
% $\mathcal{P}$ are the prompts 
$\mathcal{X}$ be the input that $\mathcal{L}$ is conditioned upon for continuation generation. 
% Our goal is to investigate biases in language generation across different demographic attributes (e.g., gender, race). 
Our goal is to investigate biases through language generation conditioned on input sentences $x\in\mathcal{X}$ across different gender attributes.
Specifically, we consider the pronouns of the two-gender task as gender attributes, 
% \textsc{Gender}, 
and we denote the set of the
paired attribute words 
% , which are associated with the demographic attribute \textit{female} as $\mathcal{W}^f=\{she, her, herself, \dots\}$ and \textit{male} as $\mathcal{W}^m=\{he, his, himself, \dots\}$ for gender bias. 
as $\mathcal{W} = \{(w^f_1, w^m_1), \cdots, (w^f_N, w^m_N)\}$, where $w^f_i\in\mathcal{W}^f=\{she, her, herself, \dots\}$ is associated with \textit{female} and $w^m_i\in\mathcal{W}^m=\{he, his, himself, \dots\}$ is associated with \textit{male} for $i\in\{1, 2, \cdots, N\}$. $\mathcal{W}^f$ and $\mathcal{W}^m$ are bijections.
In our work, we 
% define 
consider
$\mathcal{L}$ as exhibiting bias when its generated texts lead to an unequal social perception of 
% $\mathcal{W}^f$
$w^f_i$
and 
% $\mathcal{W}^m$
$w^m_i$ for $i\in\{1, 2, \cdots, N\}$. 
We focus on distributional disparities 
of gender attribute words
in the collection of generated texts.

% \textbf{Input prompts.} 
% In conditional language generation, the model's generated texts are influenced by input prompts. Different textual prompts can induce varying degrees of biased content generation, with certain biases manifesting in a more subtle manner than others. We categorize target attributes into two types: \textit{explicit target attributes}, such as Occupation and Name, which have been extensively studied and have predefined lists of stereotype tokens with respect to the demographic attributes (e.g., doctor, nurse), and \textit{implicit target attributes}, where biases are not perceptible from the sentence itself. 

% \textbf{Quantifying bias in generation.} 
% For each $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we analyze the generated sentence $s$ that has been conditioned on $p$ relating to the demographics attributes $\mathcal{W}^f$ and $\mathcal{W}^m$, and a fair model should generate texts that exhibit fairness to these attributes. Bias in generated sentences fall into two categories: \textit{explicit} and \textit{implicit}. We define explicit bias generation as the direct inclusion of demographic attribute words at the token or sentence level, which is also perceptible to human evaluators. For instance, within a generated sentence $s$, the presence of demographic attribute words $w \in \mathcal{W}^f \cup \mathcal{W}^m$ can serve as an indicator of bias. Conversely, implicit metrics assess bias from the model's perspective, considering factors such as difference in the logit distributions associated with attribute words $w^f \in \mathcal{W}^f$ and $w^m \in \mathcal{W}^m$.

% In conditional language generation, the model's generated texts are influenced by input prompts.

We categorize target attributes into two types: \textit{explicit target attributes}, such as Occupation and Name, which have been extensively studied and have predefined lists of stereotype tokens with respect to the demographic attributes (e.g., doctor, nurse), and \textit{implicit target attributes}, where biases are not perceptible from the sentence itself. 
We consider exploring two types of gender bias: \textit{explicit bias}, such as \textsc{Occupation}, which has been extensively studied and has predefined stereotype tokens with respect to the gender attributes (e.g., ``nurse'')~\cite{de2019bias,dong2023co,liang-etal-2020-towards,meade-etal-2022-empirical,rudinger-etal-2018,zhao-etal-2018-gender}, and \textit{implicit bias}, where biases are not easily perceptible.
% Thus, we construct three different types of datasets

% Template-based dataset is constructed based on \textit{explicit bias}, while LLM-generated dataset and naturally-sourced dataset reflect \textit{implicit bias}.

\smallskip
\textbf{Template-based.} 
We leverage a straightforward template, denoted as ``\texttt{subject verb object}'' which we populate with ``\textit{My friend}'' in the \texttt{subject} slot and predefined stereotype words corresponding to target attributes in the \texttt{object} slot to create individual 
% prompts. 
data sample.
To expand the scope of the existing target attribute \textsc{Occupation}, we manually construct 
% token 
lists for \textsc{Personalities}, \textsc{Hobbies}, and \textsc{Colors}.\footnote{Complete lists available in the Appendix~\ref{ssec:lists}.} 
% Subsequently, we replace the \texttt{verb} placeholder for four target attributes, respectively.
Subsequently, we replace the \texttt{verb} placeholder with ``\textit{is}'' for \textsc{Occupation} and \textsc{Personalities}, and with ``\textit{likes}'' for \textsc{Hobbies}, and \textsc{Colors}. 
For instance, when filling the template with ``\textit{running}'' from the target attribute \textsc{Hobbies}, the resulting prompt is ``\textit{My friend likes running}'' which serves as the stimulus to prompt language generation.

\smallskip
\textbf{LLM-generated.} 
Similar to automated question generation in~\cite{perez-etal-2022-red,shaikh2023second}, we employ LLMs to automatically generate explicitly unbiased statements. Specifically, we initiate this process by instructing \texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} with the following prompt: \texttt{Generate a list of statements starting with ``My friend''. For example, [S]}. The initial value of \texttt{[S]} is set to \textit{``My friend likes blue''} and it is subsequently substituted with randomly generated statements, iteratively re-prompting the model. 
This process continues 
% until we have a total of 200 statements. W
and we automatically remove duplicates and manually remove statements exhibiting high textual overlap until we have 200 statements.

\smallskip
\textbf{Naturally-sourced.} 
In addition to our templated-based and LLM-generated inputs, we derive sentences from the naturally-sourced corpus. Specifically, we adapt 
% from 
the STS-B data~\cite{cer2017semeval} and select sentences from the test set that includes 
% gender-specific terms, such as ``girl'', ``boy'', ``man'', ``woman'', etc., as templates. 
terms like \textit{``someone''}, \textit{``person''}, etc., as templates to ensure the sentences describe humans instead of animals or objects.
Subsequently, we replace these 
% gender-specific 
terms within the sentences with \textit{``My friend''}, thus obtaining our 
% corpus-derived prompts. 
gender-neutral naturally-sourced inputs to probe LLMs.
For example, if the original sentence is \textit{``A person is walking''}, our adapted sentence would be \textit{``My friend is walking''} for experimental consistency. 
% This augmentation enriches the breadth of our evaluation dataset and provides additional contextual variations for our analyses.

% \vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{Bias Evaluation Metrics Design}
% \vspace{-3mm}
% For each $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we analyze the generated sentence $s$ that has been conditioned on $p$ relating to the demographics attributes $\mathcal{W}^f$ and $\mathcal{W}^m$, and a fair model should generate texts that exhibit fairness to these attributes. Bias in generated sentences fall into two categories: \textit{explicit} and \textit{implicit}. We define explicit bias generation as the direct inclusion of demographic attribute words at the token or sentence level, which is also perceptible to human evaluators. For instance, within a generated sentence $s$, the presence of demographic attribute words $w \in \mathcal{W}^f \cup \mathcal{W}^m$ can serve as an indicator of bias. Conversely, implicit metrics assess bias from the model's perspective, considering factors such as difference in the logit distributions associated with attribute words $w^f \in \mathcal{W}^f$ and $w^m \in \mathcal{W}^m$.

To evaluate the fairness of 
% large language models in conditional text generation, 
% LLMs on three datasets,
LLMs probed using these three strategies,
we define two types of metrics: \textit{explicit bias metrics} -- gender-attribute score, and \textit{implicit bias metrics} -- co-occurrence ratio and Jensen–Shannon divergence score.
We define explicit bias generation as the direct inclusion of gender attribute words at the sentence level, which is also perceptible to human evaluators. 
% For instance, within a generated sentence $s$, the presence of demographic attribute words $w \in \mathcal{W}^f \cup \mathcal{W}^m$ can serve as an indicator of bias. 
Conversely, implicit metrics assess bias from the model's perspective, considering factors such as differences in the logit distributions associated with attribute words $w^f \in \mathcal{W}^f$ and $w^m \in \mathcal{W}^m$.

\smallskip
\textbf{Gender-attribute score.}
For each generated sentence $s \in S$, 
we use the boolean value $d_s^k$, where $k\in\{f, m, n, ns\}$, to represent different performances of the generated sentence by LLMs.
When there exists $w\in s$ such that $w\in \mathcal{W}^{f}$ and $w\notin \mathcal{W}^{m}$, we categorize $s$ as leaning towards female and $d_s^f=1$; otherwise, $d_s^f=0$. 
Same for $d_s^m$. 
For any $w\in s$, if $w\notin \mathcal{W}^{f}$ and $w\notin \mathcal{W}^{m}$, there are two possible scenarios: one in which $s$ is considered neutral ($d_s^n=1$), and the other in which $s$ is nonsensical ($d_s^{ns}=1$).
% we assess whether it includes demographic attribute words $w$ belonging to either $W_{f}$ or $W_{m}$. 
% In the context of the binary-gender task, if $w$ is a member of $W_{f}$ but not of $W_{f}$, we categorize $s$ as leaning towards female and denoted as $d_f=1$, and vice versa. 
% If no $w$ from either set is present in $s$, there are two possible scenarios: one in which $s$ is considered neutral, denoted as $d_n$, and the other in which $s$ is nonsensical, denoted as $d_{ns}$. 
In instances where there exists $w_1\in s$ that $w_1\in \mathcal{W}^{f}$ and $w_2\in s$ that $w_2\in \mathcal{W}^{m}$,
% In instances where $s$ contains $w$ from both $W_{f}$ and $W_{m}$, 
we let the human evaluators determine the bias direction. 
To quantify the overall bias level of the entire generated sentences, we compute the sum of individual sentence scores, denoted as 
$D_k = \sum_{s\in S} d_s^k$ where $k \in \{f, m, n, ns\}$.
% $D_k = \sum d_k$ where $k \in \{f, m, n, ns\}$.


\smallskip
\textbf{Co-occurrence ratio.}
For each attribute word in the \textit{female} attribute word list 
% $w^f \in \mathcal{W}^f$, 
$w^f_i \in \mathcal{W}^f$, 
% we compute the probability after applying softmax to each word, given the same model input $x \in \mathcal{X}$, represented as $p(w^f_i|x)$. 
the probability of $w^f_i$ to be the next generated token is computed given the same model input $[I; x]$, where $I$ is the instruction and $x\in\mathcal{X}$ is the input data sample. The co-occurrence ratio for female attributes is calculated as:
% In our work, input $x$ comprises instruction and prompt. 
% The probability of \textit{``she''} to be the next generated token is computed given the same model input $[I; x]$, where $I$ is the instruction and $x\in\mathcal{X}$ is the input data sample.
% % Similarly, we determine the probability for the \textit{male} attribute word $w^m_i \in \mathcal{W}^m$. Subsequently, we calculate the average percentage of the probability for all the female attributes
% Similarly, we determine the probability of \textit{``he''} to be the next generated token. 
% \begin{equation}
%     R^f = \textup{avg}(\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, n\}}\frac{p(w_i^f|[I;x])}{p(w_i^f|[I;x])+p(w_i^m|[I;x])}),
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    R^f = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{X}|}\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} (\frac{\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^f|[I;x])}{\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^f|[I;x])+\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^m|[I;x])}),
\end{equation}
and likewise for male attributes:
\begin{equation}
    R^m = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{X}|}\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}} (\frac{\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^m|[I;x])}{\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^f|[I;x])+\sum_{i \in \{1, \cdots, N\}}p(w_i^m|[I;x])}).
\end{equation}

\smallskip
\textbf{Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) score.}
To measure
% agreement 
distance
between distributions, we calculate JSD score. Specifically, in the binary-gender task of our work, JSD quantifies the alignment between the \textit{female} attribute word distributions $\mathcal{P}^f$ and \textit{male} attribute word distributions $\mathcal{P}^m$, defined as
\begin{equation}
    D_{JS}(\mathcal{P}^f||\mathcal{P}^m) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(\mathcal{P}^f||\mathcal{P}^a) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL} (\mathcal{P}^m||\mathcal{P}^a),
\end{equation}
where $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between two distributions
% $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, 
% computed as
% \begin{equation}
%     D_{KL}(\mathcal{P}||\mathcal{Q}) = \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}}\mathcal{P}(w)\textup{log}\left ( \frac{\mathcal{P}(w)}{\mathcal{Q}(w)} \right ),
% \end{equation}
and $\mathcal{P}^a = (\mathcal{P}^f+\mathcal{P}^m)/2$ is a mixture distribution of $\mathcal{P}^f$ and $\mathcal{P}^m$.

\section{Experimental Settings}
% \vspace{-3mm}

We utilize six versions of LLaMA: \texttt{llama-7b}, \texttt{llama-7b-chat}, \texttt{llama-13b}, \texttt{llama-13b-chat}, \texttt{llama-70b}, and \texttt{llama-70b-chat}.
% , which are significantly improved compared to their initial pre-trained versions in terms of both truthfulness and reducing harmful content. 
In our experiments, the input for LLMs is a combination of an instruction $I$ and a sample $x\in\mathcal{X}$: $[I;x]$, where $[;]$ denotes the concatenation operation and our specific instruction $I$ is ``\texttt{Complete the sentence}''. We configure the LLMs to generate 50 new tokens, and all experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB GPUs.

We conduct comprehensive experiments using these three strategies to probe LLMs and utilize gender-attribute score, co-occurrence ratio, and JSD score to evaluate explicit and implicit biases.

% \vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{Gender-Attribute Score}
% \vspace{-3mm}
Fig.~\ref{fig:count_ratio} shows the gender-attribute scores of output generated using our three strategies, as acquired from six different versions of LLaMA.
According to the visualization, probed by LLM-generated inputs, all LLaMAs show gender bias in varying degrees. This indicates that the potential gender bias in LLaMA is reflected in the LLM-generated inputs. Inputs from template-based and naturally sourced strategies embrace similar levels of gender bias, which reveals that sentences that appear to be free of gender bias may still exhibit gender bias similar to gender stereotypes in LLMs. Besides, for the naturally-sourced inputs, most model versions generate responses with male attribute words more than responses with female attribute words, revealing that the naturally-sourced inputs contain more gender bias leaning toward males.
It can be observed from the comparison between \texttt{llama-70b-chat} and \texttt{llama-13b} that larger models do not necessarily result in fairer models. On the other side, larger models do have better generation performance since \texttt{llama-30b}, \texttt{llama-7b}, and \texttt{llama-7b-chat} generate more non-sense responses than other model versions.

  \caption{Six examples from the outputs probed by naturally-sourced inputs. For each example, the first column is the \textit{input sentence} and the generated text by \texttt{llama-70-chat}. The second column is the sum ratio of all female attribute words, the sum ratio of all male attribute words, and the JSD score of the example. The third column is the logits distribution of female/male attribute words.}
  \label{fig:case study}
  % \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}


% \vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{Co-occurrence Ratio}
% \vspace{-3mm}
Fig.~\ref{fig:logits_ratio} displays the co-occurrence ratio and the probabilities of paired gender attribute words like $(\textit{she}, \textit{he})$ are supposed to be similar without gender context. However, for all three types of inputs, most model versions can not obtain similar gender-pair attribute word probabilities. This means LLMs like LLaMA can exhibit gender bias in generated sentences even if the inputs are in the absence of gender information. Although it may not always manifest in the generated text, we can observe this phenomenon from the logits and the co-occurrence ratio.

% \vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{JS Divergence Score}
% \vspace{-3mm}

We visualize JSD score of three types of outputs in Fig.~\ref{fig:JSD_score}. \texttt{llama-70b-chat} has the highest JSD score probed by the template-based inputs and the LLM-generated inputs, while it has a relatively low JSD score on the naturally-sourced inputs. \texttt{llama-7b-chat} has relatively high JSD scores probed by all three types of inputs, while \texttt{llama-7b} has relatively low JSD scores. Fig.~\ref{fig:JSD_score} shows that the size of the models and JSD scores do not have a constant relationship.

% \subsection{Template-constructed Dataset}
The JSD score distributions of gender-pair attribute words obtained by \texttt{llama-70b-chat} on four separate features in template-based inputs are shown in 
% Fig.~\ref{fig:individual distribution}. 
Appendix~\ref{sec: visual template-based}.
% For better figure quality, we randomly selected 20 samples for each attribute to build the figures. The complete set of visuals and visuals obtained from other models are provided in the

Out of the 40 colors,
\textit{pink} is the most biased color, which aligns with our stereotypical impressions of colors.
\textit{Sewing}, \textit{woodworking} and \textit{quilting} are the most biased hobbies. It is interesting to note that outdoor activities like \textit{hiking}, \textit{kayaking}, and \textit{fishing} are not the most biased ones, even though they have been traditionally associated with masculinity. 
% This suggests that bias and stereotypes are evolving with changes in time and society. 
\textit{Mechanic}, \textit{mover}, \textit{construction worker}, \textit{carpenter}, and \textit{nurse} exhibit the highest degree of gender bias. 
\textit{Elegant} and \textit{graceful} demonstrates the utmost level of bias among personalities.

%   \label{fig:individual distribution}
% \end{figure}

% \vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{Case Study}
% \vspace{-3mm}

In order to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results, we conduct a case study on the generated sentences conditioned on naturally sourced inputs.
We select four representative examples and visualize the corresponding logits of a word in gender attribute words being the next token generated by \texttt{llama-70b-chat} given the example in Fig.~\ref{fig:case study}. 

In the two examples shown in the first row, the model exhibits significant gender bias reflected in both logits and the generated text. \textit{``baseball''} is considered as a gender stereotype associated with males, while \textit{``studies a calendar''} contains no gender stereotypes, showing that even without explicit gender stereotype information, the model can still generate biased information.
In the two examples displayed in the second row, gender bias is reflected in logits, but it is not contained in the generated texts. \textit{``Feed a mouse to a snake''} may indeed be considered a gender stereotype related to males, but this complex behavior is difficult to predefine with a list of stereotypes.
In the two examples shown in the third row, gender bias is neither reflected in logits nor in the generated texts. The left example uses \textit{``they''} to refer to \textit{``my friend''}, which is reasonable when gender information is not available. The right example does not continue describing \textit{``my friend''}, avoiding the use of pronouns.

These examples illustrate the input sentences corresponding to different outcomes. Regardless of whether there are explicit or predefined gender stereotypes present in the inputs, the model may still convey gender bias either in logits or in the generated text, which undoubtedly brings about negative societal impacts. Therefore, detecting and mitigating gender bias in LLMs is of utmost importance.

\section{Conclusion}
% \vspace{-3mm}
In this work, we introduce a conditional text generation framework aimed at evaluating both the explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We use three distinct strategies: template-based, LLM-generated, and naturally-sourced strategies, to probe the LLMs and design explicit and implicit metrics. Our experiments reveal that a model with a larger size does not necessarily equate to greater fairness, and despite the absence of explicit gender stereotypes in inputs, LLMs can exhibit gender bias in logits or generated text, which unquestionably has adverse societal consequences. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of effective debiasing methods in future studies.
% LLMs tend to exhibit a male bias when exposed to naturally sourced probing inputs.

\section{Supplementary Material}

\subsection{Social Impacts Statement}
Our work increases the awareness of implicit gender bias issues through our experiments on three different types of inputs designed through three distinct strategies.

Many previous research efforts are focused on studying explicit gender bias and gender stereotypes. As a result, contemporary LLMs like ChatGPT~\cite{openai2023gpt4} are highly sensitive to explicit gender bias information, and may refuse to respond to inputs that contain explicit gender bias information. 
However, based on our experiments, even when input texts are in the absence of explicit gender bias, LLMs may still exhibit gender bias. These experimental findings inform us that even in cases where gender stereotypes are absent, we must remain vigilant about gender bias when utilizing LLMs.
